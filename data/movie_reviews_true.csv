Rotten Tomatoes,Paul Emmanuel Enicola,Dune 2021,"The “Dune” series has long been considered a landmark of science fiction. Fortunately, Denis Villeneuve’s astute direction in laying the right foundations only shows his respect for Frank Herbert’s work.",A-,A+
Rotten Tomatoes,Rebecca Long,Dune 2021,"While Villeneuve's version makes more of an effort than Lynch's to explore some of Dune's meatier themes, like colonization, it fails to nail the environmental ideas.",B+,A+
Rotten Tomatoes,Sarah Vincent,Dune 2021,"Villeneuve’s “Dune” is the cinematic equivalent of a meditation garden: gorgeous to watch with its characters’ polished skin, smooth stonelike spaceships, sand enveloped landscapes, sunlight",B+,A+
Rotten Tomatoes,Amy Smith,Dune 2021,"It would be enough of a cinematic experience with just the visuals, but the technical elements within the sound are award-worthy.",A+,A+
Rotten Tomatoes,Alan French,Dune 2021,"Few movies showcase this scale, and once again, Villeneuve proves himself one of the best filmmakers alive. However, some early pacing issues and the two-part nature make Dune feel somewhat incomplete.",8,10

Rotten Tomatoes,Greg Carlson,Dune 2021,"Villeneuve’s Dune: Part One is a worthy addition to the collection, besting the Lynch film in certain ways but still flummoxed and frustrated by the source material’s conversation-heavy downside.",4,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Rebecca Johnson,Dune 2021,"Dune is a masterful sci-fi blockbuster that is going to please the majority of its audience. The visuals are crying out to be seen on the biggest screen possible, easily becoming the movies standout.",4,5

Rotten Tomatoes,Nadir Samara,The Matrix,"Making a great film that's a psychedelic, kung-fu-inspired meditation on the human condition is a tall order. The Matrix delivers on all that & more.",4.5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Mark Jackson,The Matrix,“The Matrix” is the AI prophecy and wake-up call the human race is in dire need of. Watching the 2024 re-release is highly recommended.,5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Sebastian Zavala Kahn,The Matrix,"An amazing cocktail of martial arts, shootouts, philosophy, romance, fantasy, revolutionary visual effects and perfect casting. “The Matrix” surprised us 25 years ago, and it continues to surprise us in the Year of Our Lord 2024. Full review in Spanish.",5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Sean Axmaker,The Matrix,"The Wachowskis proceed to turn the world as we know it into a virtual reality landscape with a 20th century tech-noir look (lit with a sickly green hue, like the glow of an old IBM computer screen) and the physics of a video game.",5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Dan DiNicola,The Matrix,"A $60 million, high-tech assault on the senses and a pretentious insult to the mind.",5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Christopher Brandon,The Matrix,"A cyberpunk thriller that's so much fun to watch, it could single-handedly reboot the genre.",5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Bill Gallo,The Matrix,"The Wachowskis seem to be saying that while state-of-the-art effects speak for themselves, loud and clear, there's still room amid all the kicking and shooting and shouting for the carefully observed human emotion.",5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Mike Clark,The Matrix,"Though The Matrix ultimately overdoses on gloom-and-doom grunge, over-elaborate cool and especially running time, it's just clever enough to enable [the Wachowskis] to nix the sophomore jinx following 1996's Bound.",2.5,4
Rotten Tomatoes,Joe Morgenstern,The Matrix,"I know almost nothing of the intricate techniques that make The Matrix as eye-filling as it is brain-numbing, but I can tell you that... [its visuals] are wondrous to behold.",2.5,4

Rotten Tomatoes,Michael D. Reid,The Matrix,"Although it's sometimes too confounding for its own good and a little heavy on the Zen-inspired techno-babble, The Matrix is a consistently absorbing assault on the senses.",4,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Manohla Dargis,The Matrix,"There's more form than content in The Matrix, but Bill Pope's swooping, noir-inflected cinematography is wonderfully complemented by Owen Paterson's inventive production design, a great soundtrack and the best fight choreography this side of Hong Kong.",4,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Jack Mathews,The Matrix,Give [the Wachowskis] an A for effort and three A's for those effects. The Matrix is a dazzlingly original visual adventure.,3,4
Rotten Tomatoes,Terry Lawson,The Matrix,"Casting the robotic Reeves as the hope of humanity may be this oppressively long, self-satisfied movie's funniest gag, but it doesn't really make the game any fun. It means we get stuck with the least interesting player.",1,4
Rotten Tomatoes,Rene Rodriguez,The Matrix,"The Matrix's pleasures are considerable, but they're all purely visceral, too, lacking the mythology that would have elevated the movie. The movie is best taken as the first entry in a brand-new genre: post-modern sci-fi pulp.",2.5,4
Rotten Tomatoes,Stephen Cole,The Matrix,How could filmmakers who are so skilled and imaginative lose themselves (and us) in what feels like a college stab at Aldous Huxley metaphysics?,2.5,4
Rotten Tomatoes,Jay Boyar,The Matrix,"A futuristic paranoia extravaganza, it would seem to have far more appeal to an artificial intelligence than it would to human beings and other carbon-based life forms.",2,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Rene Jordan,The Matrix,"An interminable, sterile, exercise in cinematographic onanism.  [Full review in Spanish]",2.5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Gary Wolcott,The Matrix,"Like last year's Dark City, the effects and storyline of The Matrix plow through enough fresh territory to make it worth seeing.",B,A+
Rotten Tomatoes,Ron Weiskind,The Matrix,"Visually, at least, The Matrix more than lives up to its billing. Writer-directors [the Wachowskis] seem to literally bring the screen to life with action scenes that define the word kinetic.",2.5,4

Rotten Tomatoes,Wendy Ide,Inception,"Nolan is exploring dreams and the possibilities are endless, which is why it’s a little disappointing that so much of the film feels like a generic CGI action movie, albeit a high-class one.",9,10

Rotten Tomatoes,Anushka Halve,Inception,As the corridor spins the characters as well as the audience have to grapple with the blurred boundaries between reality and the subconscious.,10,10

Rotten Tomatoes,Don Shanahan,Inception,"""Inception"" delivers twists that fit the evolving context of the story it's creating and commandingly wins your attention enough to not turn you off.  While it may not seem like it, there is a point and a light at the end of the tunnel to this maze.",5,5

Rotten Tomatoes,Fausto Fernandez,Inception,Blows up completely the notion of reality based on an extraordinary overlay of Borgian levels... [Full review in Spanish],4,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Fico Cangiano,Inception,"Nolan's ""dream within a dream"" heist film, not only keeps you on the edge of your seat with incredible visual effects and memorable action set pieces, but also makes you a part of the puzzle-solving team from beginning to end. [Full review in Spanish]",5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Steven Hale,Inception,"It's not nearly as confusing as many make it out to be, but if you do find yourself losing the plot a bit, remember you're at the movies and just let it overwhelm you. That's part of the fun.",5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Taylor Hatmaker,Inception,"Inception engaged on a mainly intellectually level, but that isn't to say that film didn't pack an emotional impact.",5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Andrea Hubert,Inception,"""They say we only use a fraction of our brain's potential"" we are told in Inception. The same will never be said of Nolan.",4.5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Paul Emmanuel Enicola,Interstellar 2014,"While detractors have often accused Nolan of being all brains and no heart, “Interstellar” shows that his intellect and his emotions are not at odds—they are inextricably linked.",4.5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Benjamín Harguindey,Interstellar 2014,"Nolan, a fan of narrative devices and metaphors, uses this bending of time to create tension, drama and suspense across a multitude of spaces and timelines. [Full review in Spanish]",8,10
Rotten Tomatoes,Kevin Maher,Interstellar 2014,"[A] gorgeous, heartbreaking epic.",5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Akhil Arora,Interstellar 2014,"Humbling and epic in scope, designed and conceptualised brilliantly, but a tad too stand-off-ish emotionally. While the father-daughter dynamic works in parts, the Cooper–Brand relationship is never given the right treatment and collapses.",5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Sean Axmaker,Interstellar 2014,This is a film where complex concepts of quantum physics and powerful human emotions are inextricably intertwined and the ghost that haunts the farmhouse has both a scientific explanation and a sense of supernatural power.,5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Don Shanahan,Interstellar 2014,"""Interstellar"" pushes the limits for personal interpretation of both science and fiction. Both elements are wildly heightened to a bold scale to address the internal opposites between logic and spectacle, science and sentiment, and brains and emotion.",4,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Eddie Harrison,Interstellar 2014,…uses sci-fi to go beyond into the philosophical and spiritual beyond that few other epics can reach….,4,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Cory Woodroof,Interstellar 2014,"Nolan’s most openly emotional film, he fully lived up to his “Stanley Kubrick’s eye and Steven Spielberg’s heart” identity with this grand sci-fi epic about the sheer force of will that we have for those we love.",4,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Danielle Solzman,Interstellar 2014,Interstellar utilizes science in a way that strives for authenticity in a science-fiction thriller and it's why we're still discussing the Christopher Nolan film today.,4.5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Q.V. Hough,Interstellar 2014,"As Robert Bresson once said, “I’d rather people feel a film before understanding it.” Interstellar moved me, and I didn’t find myself fact checking the science so I could complain on Twitter.",4.5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Wendy Ide,Interstellar 2014,"Staggeringly beautiful, bafflingly complex, this is proper event cinema.",4.5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Edward Porter,Interstellar 2014,"The film demands quite a bit of time from its viewers too, but its big ideas and wondrous sights are ample reward.",4.5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Vadim Rizov,Interstellar 2014,"When Mann appears to explain man, it collapses under the weight of a repeated thesis that doesn’t merit such explicit, redundant reiteration.",4.5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Keith Garlington,Interstellar 2014,It’s a contemplative adventure and an emotional exploration that captivated me from its opening moments.,5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Brian Eggert,Interstellar 2014,Rarely do epics of this scope and intelligence reach theaters anymore; such serious commercial filmmaking seems like a market almost exclusively maintained by Christopher Nolan.,4,4
Rotten Tomatoes,Josh Parham,Interstellar 2014,"While not all-together perfect, the film represents a monumental cinematic achievement that deserves to be placed high within the caliber of Nolan’s filmography.",9,10
Rotten Tomatoes,Therese Lacson,Interstellar 2014,"The inherent message of the film brings hope, but it can definitely get waterlogged by intellectual speak and long-winded scenes.",3,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Kip Mooney,Interstellar 2014,The film is indeed a sight to behold -- and one that demands to be seen on the biggest possible screen.,B,A+
Rotten Tomatoes,Richard Crouse,Interstellar 2014,"Nolan reaches for the stars with beautifully composed shots and some mind-bending special effects, but the dime store philosophy of the story never achieves lift off.",3,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Mike Massie,Interstellar 2014,Audiences are sure to lose their suspensions of disbelief over the nearly impenetrable climax.,5,10
Rotten Tomatoes,Martin Carr,The Dark Knight 2008,The Dark Knight takes comic book characters and plants them firmly in the real world. Revealing a Gotham defined by human flaws and plummeting into freefall. That realism puts it head and shoulders above almost anything else and redefines a genre.,10,10
Rotten Tomatoes,Juan Pablo Russo,The Dark Knight 2008,"With a memorable performance from Heath Ledger, masterful direction from Nolan, and bold storytelling, this film stands out as one of the best comic book adaptations in film history. [Full Review in Spanish]",10,10
Rotten Tomatoes,Akhil Arora,The Dark Knight 2008,It doesn’t matter how many superhero movies its crosstown rival makes; it’ll never match the brilliance that Nolan delivered the same year Marvel began its infinite project. Firing on all cylinders … this is the most complete film Nolan has ever made.,10,10
Rotten Tomatoes,Christian Eulinberg,The Dark Knight 2008,"For the longest time, I’ve viewed this film as the Godfather of live-action Batman films.",10,10

Rotten Tomatoes,Mike Massie,The Dark Knight 2008,The famous masked vigilante has never looked or felt more intense.,7,10
Rotten Tomatoes,Jason Best,The Dark Knight 2008,"With his smeared whiteface make-up and leering razor-slashed smile, Ledger's Joker is creepy enough to look at, but what he represents is even more chilling.",7,10
Rotten Tomatoes,Richard Propes,The Dark Knight 2008,The awards hype is warranted.,3.5,4.0
Rotten Tomatoes,Siddhant Adlakha,The Dark Knight 2008,"The Dark Knight managed to capture something complex and instinctive about the ""war on terror"" era.",3.5,4.0
Rotten Tomatoes,Josh Wilding,The Dark Knight 2008,"A masterpiece. Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight is not only one of the greatest comic book movies you'll ever see, but also one of the best films of all-time.",5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Felicia Feaster,The Dark Knight 2008,It seems almost cruel to take beloved child archetypes and turn them into projections for adult angst.,5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Paul McGuire Grimes,The Dark Knight 2008,"Heath Ledger gives one of the best performances of the last twenty years. When you watch his take on the Joker, it's one of complete surprise and mystery. It's frightening with how chaotic and mischievous he makes him.",5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Micheal Compton,The Dark Knight 2008,"Ledger's performance alone is good enough to make The Dark Knight a very good movie, but fortunately this is a film with even more than that -- making it the not just the best film of the summer, but one of the best films of the year.",A,A+

Rotten Tomatoes,Rachel Wagner,The Dark Knight 2008,Heath Ledger is great.,B+,A+
Rotten Tomatoes,Eileen Jones,The Dark Knight 2008,"The movie's a real neo-noir all right, wallowing in darkness, thrilled with how bad we are, and getting such a kick out of our impending doom it cheers you right up.",B+,A+
Rotten Tomatoes,M.N. Miller,The Shawshank Redemption,"[The Shawshank Redemption] is the cinematic equivalent of therapy, showcasing the power of vulnerability.",B+,A+
Rotten Tomatoes,Calum Cooper,The Shawshank Redemption,The Shawshank Redemption is as beautiful and genuine now as it was in its initial overlooked run.,5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Grant Hermanns,The Shawshank Redemption,"Frank Darabont's The Shawshank Redemption is not only still one of the best Stephen King adaptations, but also a wonderful exploration of hope.",4.5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Adam Kempenaar,The Shawshank Redemption,Deakins’s work here began his run of 16 Oscar nominations... it’s a crucial part of Shawshank’s enduring legacy.,4.5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Josh Larsen,The Shawshank Redemption,... a faith-based movie without any faith.,3,4
Rotten Tomatoes,Dan Buffa,The Shawshank Redemption,"Darabont cut right to the heart of a flock of human birds trapped in a giant cage, under the watch of a corrupt warden and terrifyingly sinister guard. It was serious, certain, and made you laugh. Freeman's legend has never shined brighter.",A+,A+
Rotten Tomatoes,Jonathan Romney,The Shawshank Redemption,If this is a feel-good movie -- and by the end it certainly is -- then at least it challenges us to dig deep for those good feelings when everything inside those mausoleum walls is unrelievedly harsh and grey.,A+,A+
Rotten Tomatoes,Jay Boyar,The Shawshank Redemption,"The Shawshank Redemption is both resigned and inspirational, grittily realistic and vaguely surreal, matter-of-fact and operatic. Somehow, these opposites are combined into a remarkably smooth and lyrical composition.",A+,A+
Rotten Tomatoes,Adam Mars-Jones,The Shawshank Redemption,"The sad thing is that The Shawshank Redemption, a so-so film, would have made a terrific little movie. A pacier project would have given us less time to notice sentimentalities.",A+,A+
Rotten Tomatoes,Malcolm Johnson,The Shawshank Redemption,"Next to Stand By Me, The Shawshank Redemption ranks as the strongest, purest film ever made from a novel or novella by Stephen King, a monster film where the horrors are frighteningly human.",3.5,4
Rotten Tomatoes,Yardena Arar,The Shawshank Redemption,"It's Robbins and Freeman who carry the film, working around the most predictable moments with simple understatement.",3.5,4
Rotten Tomatoes,David Denby,The Shawshank Redemption,"There's nothing going on in The Shawshank Redemption from shot to shot -- no expressive life, no spontaneity or feeling. It's a stunted movie.",3.5,4
Rotten Tomatoes,William Arnold,The Shawshank Redemption,"The acting is so strong, so seductive in The Shawshank Redemption that you almost don't notice this epic prison drama isn't all that good.",2.5,4
Rotten Tomatoes,Manohla Dargis,The Shawshank Redemption,"Darabont, making his debut as a director, is swamped by ambition. There is just too much here -- too much plot, too many particulars, too many prisoners vying for attention.",2.5,4
Rotten Tomatoes,Michael Medved,The Shawshank Redemption,A hackneyed prison movie with acting so strong that it often seems more substantive than it is.,2.5,4
Rotten Tomatoes,Michael Wilmington,The Shawshank Redemption,"The Shawshank Redemption may be working with stuff we've seen before, but it's surprisingly strong and engrossing. Even elitists in the audience who dismiss King as a shock schlockmeister may be amazed at this picture's narrative grip.",3.5,4
Rotten Tomatoes,Kenneth Turan,The Shawshank Redemption,"Its message of hope and friendship comes premixed with a sizable dollop of unappetizing violence, intended to convince audiences that what they're watching isn't a big glob of cotton candy after all.",3.5,4
Rotten Tomatoes,Lea Saslav,The Shawshank Redemption,"Darabont gets Robbins' most subtle and multi-layered performance to date. But the Oscar nomination will go to Freeman, who shows the majesty of sadness and how sweet redemption can be -- even when all hope is lost.",3.5,4
Rotten Tomatoes,Jeff Simon,The Shawshank Redemption,"It's a movie with dignity and surprises and before it has finished, it has acquired a good deal of power.",4,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Lizzie Francke,The Shawshank Redemption,"The towering Tim Robbins has a solidity and gentle interiority that occasionally reminds one here of Burt Lancaster. Of equal excellence is Morgan Freeman as Red, who holds the film together with his poetic, often quipping narration.",4,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Ben Gibbons,Fight Club,David Fincher created a masterpiece in this mind-bending psychological drama that features a star-studded cast with extraordinary twists.,4.5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Christopher Lloyd,Fight Club,David Fincher's prescient rumination on manhood at the close of the 20th century was a revolutionary movie about revolutionary men in a time of complacence.,4,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Martin Carr,Fight Club,"Fight Club feels like a declaration of artistic intent with an axe to grind. It comes across as a tour de force from director David Fincher, and aggressively courts controversy whilst remaining a truly riveting piece of work",8,10
Rotten Tomatoes,Kevin Maher,Fight Club,From the guitar roar on the Dust Brothers' opening title track through to the thundering drums of Pixies' Where Is My Mind? it is pure synapse-splitting sensory overload and the road that commercial cinema refused to take.,5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Dennis Harvey,Fight Club,"Fight Club did indeed fly over the heads of audiences expecting straight macho action thrills, as opposed to a mind-messing critique of the same, as well as capitalism, material acquisition, masculinity and other sacred cows of national identity.",5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Chuck Klosterman,Fight Club,"Fight Club is very, very, very good.",3.5,4
Rotten Tomatoes,Manuel São Bento,Fight Club,"With an absolutely brilliant direction and execution, David Fincher uses Jim Uhls’ captivating, layered, unconventional screenplay to tackle themes such as consumerism, society’s behavior, and mental health.",A-,A+
Rotten Tomatoes,Wendy Ide,Fight Club,David Fincher’s adaptation of the Chuck Palahniuk novel is a shrewd and expertly crafted study of the male in crisis.,A-,A+
Rotten Tomatoes,David Reddish,Fight Club,It seems like the male characters in Fight Club would be a whole lot happiernot to mention healthierif they could express respect and affection through the magic of gay sex.,3.5,4
Rotten Tomatoes,James Croot,Fight Club,"The first rule of Fight Club, as we're constantly reminded, might not be to talk about it, but once seen, it is most certainly not forgotten, even 22 years on.",4.5,5

Rotten Tomatoes,Sarah Brinks,Fight Club,"David Fincher is an interesting director whose films more often than not work for me, Fight Club is a notable exception.",10,10
Rotten Tomatoes,Luke Hicks,Fight Club,"Shocking violence, utter chaos, spirited editing, and mindfuck finales can be found elsewhere. Pitt haranguing a squirrelly Norton everyman on consumerist ideals, however, is forever.",10,10
Rotten Tomatoes,Marianna Neal,Fight Club,"It's bold, it's gritty, it's rebellious, it's unapologetic, it takes risks, and it's narrator reflects the frustrations of many people.",10,10
Rotten Tomatoes,Mike Massie,Fight Club,Unsubtle subliminal messages pair with skewed perceptions to demonstrate overstressed stylization and a hopelessly circuitous plot.,8,10
Rotten Tomatoes,Sezín Koehler,Fight Club,'Fight Club' examines David Fincher's portrait of toxic masculinity from the female gaze.,5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Fico Cangiano,Fight Club,"Brad Pitt and Edward Norton are both perfect in David Fincher's anarchic, moody and violent film. [Full review in Spanish]",4,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Bob Thomas,Fight Club,"Perhaps it is postmodern filmmaking, whatever that means. In any case, Fight Club remains the ugliest, most inhuman film since Natural Born Killers.",C-,A+
Rotten Tomatoes,PJ Nabarro,Fight Club,The film's tongue is far too firmly in its cheek at all points of its discourse to ever take its characters' actions too much at face value.,4,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Patrick Z. McGavin,Fight Club,"The movie demands a certain attention and is not easily dismissed, but there is something deeply unsettling about a work that uncritically espouses brutality as a function of alienation and nonconformity.",4,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Dan Buffa,Pulp Fiction,"From the riveting split story lines and hyper-profanity to the quotable dialogue and shocking action, Tarantino's movie reverberated then and still does to this day.",4,5
Rotten Tomatoes,M.N. Miller,Pulp Fiction,"Super cool, totally thrilling, and a startling blend of homage and originality that has not been matched since—once you see it, you’ll never view cinema the same way again.",10,10
Rotten Tomatoes,Grant Hermanns,Pulp Fiction,"Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction not only remains his best movie, but is an exhilarating crime saga full of great performances and energetic writing.",5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Kevin Maher,Pulp Fiction,"... A controversial yet award-worthy combination of gorgeous dialogue, genre-literacy, guns and gore.",5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Alan French,Pulp Fiction,"Pulp Fiction may not be perfect (the Butch sequence struggles to reach the heights of the others). However, its highs are among the very best in cinema history.",10,10
Rotten Tomatoes,Sean Axmaker,Pulp Fiction,... a film that twists and turns and double backs on itself with the sheer delight of a narrative magician.,10,10
Rotten Tomatoes,Roger Ebert,Pulp Fiction,"Quentin Tarantino is the Jerry Lee Lewis of cinema, a pounding performer who doesn't care if he tears up the piano, as long as everybody is rocking.",4,4
Rotten Tomatoes,Marjorie Baumgarten,Pulp Fiction,Rarely have I left a movie theatre more thrilled or invigorated as I did after leaving Pulp Fiction.,4.5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Tom Long,Pulp Fiction,"There is a fine madness to writer/director/actor Quentin Tarantino's latest wonderwork, Pulp Fiction, which is certainly one of the most exciting films of the past 20 years and easily the most important film of 1994.",A+,A+
Rotten Tomatoes,Peter Keough,Pulp Fiction,"Unlike his first film, Reservoir Dogs, whose genius lay in its ability to shock and dazzle, Pulp Fiction penetrates the glib surface of style, allusion, and machismo to the murky meaning of these things.",A+,A+
Rotten Tomatoes,Peter Travers,Pulp Fiction,There's a special kick that comes from watching something this thrillingly alive.,A+,A+
Rotten Tomatoes,Eleanor Ringel Cater,Pulp Fiction,"The actors know they've got a good thing and, echoing Tarantino's boldness and resourcefulness, they give it everything they've got.",A+,A+
Rotten Tomatoes,Elizabeth Pincus,Pulp Fiction,"Like its source material, Pulp Fiction is comic and grim, sun-soaked and shadowy, tender and blunt. A pop-drenched dream reel, the film is both a reverential nod to the power of words and a stunning entertainment that more than lives up to its hype.",A+,A+
Rotten Tomatoes,Desson Thomson,Pulp Fiction,"Brilliant and brutal, funny and exhilarating, jaw-droppingly cruel and disarmingly sweet.",A+,A+
Rotten Tomatoes,Marylynn Uricchio,Pulp Fiction,"A truly great soundtrack keeps the tone hip and even steals a scene or two. Not that Tarantino doesn't have plenty to spare. Pulp Fiction is riveting filmmaking funny, visceral, stylish and so unabashedly original that you never want it to end.",4,4
Rotten Tomatoes,Dolores Barclay,Pulp Fiction,"Unlike too many movies with annoying soundtracks that make up for inferior filmmaking, Tarantino allows natural sounds to slip in -- traffic utensils and other everyday background noises. It allows for more drama and a greater buildup of tension.",4,4
Rotten Tomatoes,Gene Siskel,Pulp Fiction,"In between the violence, which does get hard R-rated extreme, the real pleasure of Pulp Fiction is listening to these folks talk. If you smile at David Mamet's dialogue, you'll laugh out loud at the words of Quentin Tarantino.",4,4
Rotten Tomatoes,Steve Persall,Pulp Fiction,Nothing you've ever seen on screen fully prepares you for the audacious ferocity of Quentin Tarantino's pitch-black comedy Pulp Fiction.,A+,A+
Rotten Tomatoes,Rene Rodriguez,Pulp Fiction,"[Pulp Fiction] is a dazzling feat of writing. Lurid and unexpectedly hilarious, it's a deceptive piece of work that appears slight and simple on the surface but grows richer and more complex with hindsight.",3.5,4

Rotten Tomatoes,Martin Carr,The Dark Knight Rises,"Saved by some top-tier performances from Anne Hathaway, Tom Hardy, and Joseph Gordon-Levitt - The Dark Knight Rises suffers from over-indulgence elsewhere.

Rotten Tomatoes,Matt Brunson,Joker Folie A Deux,"Seeking a minority opinion? Here’s one: Joker: Folie à Deux is superior to 2019's Joker in just about every way.

Rotten Tomatoes,Graeme Tuckett,The Take 2016,"[The movie] falls to bits pretty badly in the home-straight and the story tosses any credibility out the window. But, by that time, the film has earned enough goodwill that you'll be prepared to just sit back and enjoy it until the credits roll.",3,5

Rotten Tomatoes,Richard Crouse,Get Out,"Get Out is a horror film but like all great genre films it isn't just that. It could more rightly be called a social thriller, a film that looks at everyday ills - in this case racial tension - through the lens of a genre movie.",4,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Tony Black,Get Out,"A tense, creeping drama that gets under your skin, makes you laugh and then explodes outward in the most satisfying, pulpy of ways. Get Out is all of those things.",5,5

Rotten Tomatoes,Calum Cooper,The Super Mario Bros Movie,"All movies exist to sell, but this exists to sell everything but the movie. It’s not a love letter – it’s soulless capitalism. The Super Mario Bros Movie is an imagination-free wasteland where cinematic storytelling goes to die.",1,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Ankit Ojha,The Super Mario Bros Movie,A specific sequence set across the streets of Brooklyn is a gorgeous nod to the 2D platformer aesthetic. It might be my favorite adaptation of the gamified visual look to the big screen since “Tron: Legacy.”,3,5

Rotten Tomatoes,Benjamin Wiebe,The Suicide Squad,"The Suicide Squad isn’t a subtle film, in its violence, or its themes. There is a lot to unpack with this film regarding the American prison system, American Interventionalism, and what it means to keep the peace.",A-,A+
Rotten Tomatoes,Adrian Ruiz,The Suicide Squad,"If you are looking for a film that improves on every misstep that its predecessors made, The Suicide Squad is that film.

Rotten Tomatoes,Bill Cosford,1032176-Goodfellas,"The simple fact, as exhilarating as it is dreadful, is that after a life of crime, Hill had but one regret -- that he had to stop. This is the engine of GoodFellas, an idea as elemental as it is radical.",3.5,4
Rotten Tomatoes,Hal Lipper,1032176-Goodfellas,"Scorsese's GoodFellas is an unparalleled achievement, the most chilling and savagely droll account of mob life ever recorded on film.",5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Jeff Simon,1032176-Goodfellas,"The audience at GoodFellas spends a good deal of the movie exhilarated and laughing. It's a very funny movie, but most of the laughs are turned back on the audience. You don't get away with it.",4,4

Rotten Tomatoes,Douglas Davidson,Seven,"... while there are elements that don’t align to today’s standards of social correctness, it is no less a remarkable work whose twists continue to marvel, even when you can identify the breadcrumbs that were missed on an initial viewing",3.5,4
Rotten Tomatoes,Allison Rose,Seven,"There is so much to love about Se7en, it is easy to see why it appears on several 'top 100 of all time' lists.",5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Jake Cole,Seven,"As horrific as the conclusion is, it’s also the final catalyst that shocks Somerset out of his own downturn toward defeatism and back toward a fight, however daunting, for humanity.",5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Abigail Stevens,Seven,"Se7en is a grisly murder thriller, with an intriguing discourse surrounding the symbolism of the murders and Freeman and Pitt as a strong lead duo.",4,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Joe Lipsett,Seven,"A stone cold classic, especially from a technical point of view. It's incredibly moody, cements a number of tropes for serial killer/crime texts, and (despite the presence of Spacey), John Doe and that finale are iconic.",4.5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Jay Carr,Seven,"When Seven, with its velvety world of bottomless evil, taps you on the shoulder, your instinct will be to dive under the theater seat.",4.5,5

Rotten Tomatoes,Gene Siskel,Seven,The results of the killings are needlessly grotesque and don't really serve the smart screenplay by Andrew Kevin Walker and the artful direction of David Fincher. All of this talent is worth seeing if you can look past the gruesome details.,3,4

Rotten Tomatoes,Mark Johnson,Silence Of The Lambs,"Suspenseful and shrewd, Hopkins’ Lecter is one of the most fascinating villains in film (despite less than 20 min of screen time).

Rotten Tomatoes,Jana Monji,Saving Private Ryan,Who knew the pairing of Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks would result in three well-produced limited series on WW II? The opening scenes are thrilling but the script's structure relies on an interpreter and that should make us question other war films.,3,5

Rotten Tomatoes,Matt Brunson,Leon The Professional,"A favorite of IMDb fanboys and reportedly of pedophiles as well, Leon: The Professional is noteworthy as marking French helmer Luc Besson's first American production as well as showcasing the film debut of a then-13-year-old Natalie Portman.",2.5,4
Rotten Tomatoes,Nick Rogers,Leon The Professional,"Luc Besson's original cut feels more like a journey than just a joy-buzzer jolt of action, and the deeper, braver, darker story he set out to tell - a fractured and fractious fairy tale. When people rave about ""The Professional,"" they mean ""Lon.""",4.5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Peter Galvin,Leon The Professional,"No matter what uncomfortable undercurrents the film gives rise to, Besson's skill with action is inventive and creative (and of course over the top).",3,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Peter Travers,Leon The Professional,Leave it to french writer-director Luc Besson (La Femme Nikita) to put a kinky twist on Orphan Annie and Daddy Warbucks.,3,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Steven Rea,Leon The Professional,"Ultimately, like La Femme Nikita, there may be less here than meets the eye. But what does meet the eye is pretty darn thrilling.",3,4
Rotten Tomatoes,Michael Wilmington,Leon The Professional,"The sheer craziness and excessiveness of the movie -- no crazier, perhaps, than many of the American action movies it copies -- never finds a center of gravity.",2,4
Rotten Tomatoes,Roger Hurlburt,Leon The Professional,"The Professional is intriguing, but misses the mark as a potential cult favorite.",2,4

Rotten Tomatoes,Douglas Davidson,1003707-Casablanca,"... as some of those Axis Powers rear their heads up in America, seeking to take control as shouts of America First grow louder once more, a film like ""Casablanca"" can remind audiences of what happens when even the most jaded of us take up arms once more.",5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Cinelandia Staff,1003707-Casablanca,Casablanca presents us with a film of extraordinary quality.  [Full review in Spanish],5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Keith Garlington,1003707-Casablanca,“Casablanca” captures and utilizes so many things well. There’s a high level of suspense. There’s a touch of humor. There is a great realization of wartime tensions. And right in the middle of it all is what may be the best romance in cinema history.,5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Dilys Powell,1003707-Casablanca,"Casablanca, in fact, is starry with talent, pictorially often lovely and directed with considerable spirit by Michael Curtiz.",5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Pauline Kael,1003707-Casablanca,"It's far from a great film, but it has a special appealingly schlocky romanticism, and you're never really pressed to take its melodramatic twists and turns seriously.",5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Josh Parham,1003707-Casablanca,"As soon as the main titles end, you are transported into a world filled with great performances and an incredibly sophisticated screenplay that takes advantage of every emotion you can think of.",10,10
Rotten Tomatoes,Brian Eggert,1003707-Casablanca,"It continues to fascinate audiences in a way that is beyond explanation, except to resolve that the picture seems to result from and fully encompass that somewhat fantastical notion of Movie Magic.",4,4
Rotten Tomatoes,Manny Farber,1003707-Casablanca,"Casablanca is as ineffectual as a Collier’s short story, but with one thing and another -- like Bergman, Veidt and Humphrey Bogart -- it is a pleasure of sorts.",4,4
Rotten Tomatoes,T.C. Kemp,1003707-Casablanca,The plot is complicated in detail but clear in its issue; and it is in the presentation of the tortuous means by which the desperately-desired end is gained that the picture succeeds admirably.,4,4
Rotten Tomatoes,Reg Whitley,1003707-Casablanca,"So topical is the dialogue that it might have been written yesterday, instead of six months ago.",4,4

Rotten Tomatoes,Sarah Brinks,1003707-Casablanca,"Casablanca walks a thin line between classic romance and cheesy, but it stays true to its course. It could have very easily steered right into cheesy and stayed there, but because Curtiz had a vision it doesn't go there.",4,4
Rotten Tomatoes,Joanne Laurier,1003707-Casablanca,"This is an occasion where the final whole seriously and decisively outweighs the sum of its flawed, imperfect parts. Screenwriter Koch lived up to his pledge to ""develop a serious melodrama of present-day significance.""",4,4

Rotten Tomatoes,Diana Tuova,The Great Gatsby 2013,"Extravagant and “modern”, the classic book adaptation is flawed, but its production design still wows, and DiCaprio’s mysterious turns inject much needed emotion and “substance”... the film is not saved by Luhrmann – it is saved in spite of him.",3.5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Dennis Harvey,The Great Gatsby 2013,"It is too painful even to imagine the havoc a director as MTV-flashy and hollow as BL wrought on poor Fitzgerald, the literary hero of my teenage years...",3.5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Bianca Garner,The Great Gatsby 2013,"The Great Gatsby lacks the charm and the nostalgia of musicals such as High Society, An American in Paris, and Singin’ in the Rain. Ehrlich claims Luhrmann is trying to reinvent the present, but it doesn’t feel like that way.",3.5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,James Croot,The Great Gatsby 2013,"Flappers and fops, speakeasies and saps get the Baz Luhrmann movie-musical mash-up treatment in this 2013 visually arresting take on F. Scott Fitzgerald's much-loved 1925 novel.",4,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Brian Eggert,The Great Gatsby 2013,"Lurhmann’s over-the-top and certainly overwrought approach may be refreshingly unconventional to some, but it fails to achieve Nick’s crucial observer status as “within and without” by delighting far too much in the billowing decadence of the setting",2,4
Rotten Tomatoes,Keith Garlington,The Great Gatsby 2013,"Baz Luhrmann may be trying to capture the vivacity of F. Scott Fitzgerald’s novel through his visual style, but I think the story itself retains plenty of that for my taste.",4,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Cody Dericks,The Great Gatsby 2013,"[Luhrmann] pushes style to the brink and even crosses the line of excess at times, but it's all in service of selling the film's exploration of the gilded false happiness that the achieved American Dream brings.",7,10
Rotten Tomatoes,Sarah McMullan,The Great Gatsby 2013,"This divisive adaptation of F. Scott Fitzgerald's classic novel is at the very least delicious to look at, with the infamous parties that drive the novel depicted in all their extravagance and glory by Australian auteur Baz Luhrmann.",7,10
Rotten Tomatoes,Niall Browne,The Great Gatsby 2013,"Baz Luhrmann's The Great Gatsby is a failure. It's a poor adaptation of F. Scott Fitzgerald's powerful text and it's tragic that such a great novel has been bastardised, becoming a flashy, CGI blockbuster.",1,5
Rotten Tomatoes,David Walsh,The Great Gatsby 2013,The Australian director brings to the material a largely crude and cartoonish approach. He appears to suffer from an almost fatal literal-mindedness.,1,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Sarah Mirk,The Great Gatsby 2013,The film does nothing to beat against the current. There's no lesson that all this 1920s extravagance is problematic. The message is to party like a rock star and dress like a robber baron - just don't waste all your money chasing a woman who waffles.,1,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Leigh Paatsch,The Great Gatsby 2013,"The lead trio of DiCaprio, Carey Mulligan and Tobey Maguire keep proceedings grounded by applying a sincere emotional gravity to their performances.",3,5

Rotten Tomatoes,Brent McKnight,The Great Gatsby 2013,"For all the gimmicks, flamboyant celebrations, and intrusive modern flourishes, the film is loud and boisterous, but ultimately empty.

Rotten Tomatoes,David Lamble,The Great Gatsby 2013,"[It] allows a modern audience to see Leo's stylized Gatsby as more than a petulant nouveau riche interloper, to grasp that Gatsby is at heart a story of class warfare, disguised as a doomed love affair.",8,10

Rotten Tomatoes,Matt Brunson,Usual Suspects,"With one Internet to rule them all, it's hard for most folks to avoid cinematic spoilers of yore (whether it's the sled in Citizen Kane or the penis in The Crying Game), but even knowing the answer shouldn't spoil this film's myriad other pleasures.",3.5,4

Rotten Tomatoes,C.J. Prince,Usual Suspects,"A film that was compelling enough with its intricate narrative and colorful cast of degenerates, became an entirely different beast with its final sequence, putting the twist in plot-twist more memorably than M. Night Shyamalan could ever dream of.",5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Leigh Paatsch,Usual Suspects,A movie where the getting-there (and the getting-away-with-it) is everything.,5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Dan Webster,Usual Suspects,"Singer, like Tarantino, is less into mining new film themes than in re-inventing old ones. And the way he does so shows full well that there is still a bit of life in the old mob movie yet.",3.5,4
Rotten Tomatoes,Dan Webster,Usual Suspects,"It stands up brilliantly to repeat viewing, to the extent that you may never fully solve the riddle. But don't let that put you off; it's the ultimate whodunit.",3.5,4
Rotten Tomatoes,David Parkinson,Usual Suspects,It's a film that demands to be watched again and again -- this is good old-fashioned pulp fiction told in the slickest 1990s style.,5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Gary Thompson,Usual Suspects,"Give director Bryan Singer credit for providing a plot that is not resolved by an exchange of gunfire, but don't expect the movie's glib punchline to stay with you for very long.",2.5,4
Rotten Tomatoes,Doug Thomas,Usual Suspects,"An imaginative, entertaining crime mystery with plenty of nerve and vigor.",3.5,4
Rotten Tomatoes,Christopher Lloyd,Untouchables,"Brian De Palma and David Mamet's genre masterpiece is an opera of sentiment and sadism, the story of a good man who adopts the brutish tactics of his enemy but somehow remains untouched.",5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Christopher Connor,Untouchables,It is an impeccably acted film with some strong cinematography and a fine score from Ennio Morricone. It successfully updates its 50s source material and still feels timely over 30 years removed from its release,5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Manuel São Bento,Untouchables,"The Untouchables still holds up incredibly well after more than thirty years. Production-wise, not only do the sets and costumes seamlessly resemble the Prohibition Era, but Brian DePalma’s technically impressive blocking and framing are a joy to watch.",A-,A+
Rotten Tomatoes,Keith Garlington,Untouchables,It more than delivered when I finally saw it during the summer of 1987. It was nice to see that it still holds up after all these years.,4.5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Stephen Silver,Untouchables,"A gorgeously-mounted, well-acted, and all-around fantastic motion picture, featuring all-time greats of the form on both sides of the camera- it's just a shame that almost nothing in it is true (35th anniversary)",4.5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Ed Travis,Untouchables,I’d argue that De Palma’s Untouchables more than cements its status as a crime/action classic based almost solely on its iconic style alone.,4.5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Richard Roeper,Untouchables,"“The Untouchables” is heavy on the fiction, but thanks in large part to those great Chicago locales, it feels palpable and real.",4.5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Danielle Solzman,Untouchables,"Even though David Mamet's script takes a few too many historical liberties for my tastes, The Untouchables reinvents the genre.",4,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Douglas Davidson,Untouchables,"Though the film doesn’t explore this as much as might satisfy those interested in the moral quandary at the heart of the film, there’s no denying its place in cinema history.",4,5
Rotten Tomatoes,George Morris,Untouchables,"To paraphrase William Butler Yeats, the moral, psychological, and emotional center of The Untouchables, like that of all of De Palma’s movies and like that of Reagan’s administration, simply cannot hold.",1,4
Rotten Tomatoes,Stephen Hunter,Untouchables,"The characters become moral forces rather than human beings, and the story has the tinny resonance of a cheap western. It's fabulously entertaining for what it is, but its lack of ambition leaves you a little depressed.",1,4
Rotten Tomatoes,Fico Cangiano,Untouchables,"The Untouchables is an entertaining cop vs. mob, action drama, that includes good performances, but it's too melodramatic. Full review in Spanish",3.5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Brian Eggert,Untouchables,"Although Brian De Palma took The Untouchables as a studio job to service his smaller, more involved passion projects, the outcome feels personal and uniquely carved from the director's point-of-view.",4,4
Rotten Tomatoes,Mark Jackson,Untouchables,"""The Untouchables"" felt untouchable in '87; cutting edge, one of those movies you saw multiple times and not just because there wasn't yet the deluge of Hollywood entertainment ""product"" as there is in 2020. Make that 2019. You know why.",4,5

Rotten Tomatoes,Richard Freedman,Untouchables,"It's a beautifully controlled film, as well as an intensely exciting and enjoyable one. Although De Niro and Connery easily walk away with the acting honors, the less flamboyant performance of Costner is perhaps the most admirable in the film.",4,4
Rotten Tomatoes,Don Shanahan,Untouchables,All of it sizzles with cigar smoke mixing with spent gunpowder and lament.,4,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Bob Thomas,Untouchables,"The Untouchables is a terrific movie, full of the same brand of fierce vitality that made the 1930s gangster films so compelling.",4,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Duane Byrge,Untouchables,"While overtly melodramatic, The Untouchables is a perceptive and hard-driven actioner. It's an intriguing character confrontation, loaded with ironies, both personal and social.",4,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Derek Malcolm,Untouchables,"The Untouchables is two hours of fairly solid entertainment, an eventually uplifting parable about right beating might, cast in the form of a Warner Brothers social realist picture of the thirties.",4,5
Rotten Tomatoes,William Stottor,Cinema Paradiso,"One of the greatest Italian films, Cinema Paradiso is a special, timeless classic that will make you smile and weep in equal measure.",5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,David Parkinson,Cinema Paradiso,This is both an unashamedly sentimental rite-of-passage picture and a charming reminder of the lost magic of cinema-going.,5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Terry Francis,Cinema Paradiso,"The story is drawn from the director Giuseppe Tornatore's childhood memories, presented here as a series of loosely-linked episodes commemorating the importance of movies -- of art -- in the lives of people forced to manage on very little.",3,4
Rotten Tomatoes,Michael Clark,Cinema Paradiso,"The theatrical cut left a major sub-plot thread dangling, which didn’t seem to bother many other viewers or critics.

Rotten Tomatoes,Matt Brunson,Cinema Paradiso,"The theatrical version is a movie of extraordinary passion. In the Director's Cut, it's still an excellent film, just not a transcendent one.",4,4
Rotten Tomatoes,Patrick Gamble,Cinema Paradiso,"A celebration of cinema's communal experience, this lovingly crafted ode to the joys projected upon the silver screen is a touching celebration of moviegoing.",4,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Mike Massie,Cinema Paradiso,"Although charming, its substance isn't overwhelmingly deep, serving more as a lighthearted, idealized, nostalgic coming-of-age tale than a stirring emotional investment.",8,10

Rotten Tomatoes,David Denby,Alien,"Alien, like the Exorcist, works on your nerves and emotions with the practiced hand of a torturer extracting a confession. The movie is terrifying, but not in a way that is remotely enjoyable.",4,4
Rotten Tomatoes,Charles Champlin,Alien,"You are in for jolts, shocks and some fairly gruesome and shuddering sights. With only his second feature, Ridley Scott has emerged as a major film maker. What he has to say is still not clear, but he certainly knows how to say it effectively.",4,4
Rotten Tomatoes,Bill Cosford,Alien,"There are no moral choices, no Deer Hunter ambiguity or Midnight Express propaganda. There is only the quandary over whether to stick it out until the end, edge of the seat and all, or bolt for the exits and a dreamless sleep. Alien is very scary.",4,4

Rotten Tomatoes,James T. Hamada,Modern Times,"It doesn't seem possible to inject a large quantity of heart appeal in a heavily gagged-up comedy but Chaplin does it. That's Chaplin's forte, and that's what distinguishes his comedies from all others.",3,4
Rotten Tomatoes,E. de S. Melcher,Modern Times,Chaplin exhibits his amazing versatility in the fast-forgotten art of pantomime and makes you laugh when you had perhaps expected to cry.,3,4
Rotten Tomatoes,Picture Parade,Modern Times,"Remaining silent, Charlie is more eloquent in pantomime than many other comedians are with the added use of spoken words. Poking gentle fun at mechanized industry, Charlie is comic indeed.",4,4
Rotten Tomatoes,P.S. Harrison,Modern Times,"Five years absence from the screen has not diminished Chaplin's art. In his usual fashion, he can provoke laughs or tears, and keep the audience absorbed in whatever he is doing.",4,4
Rotten Tomatoes,Winston Burdett,Modern Times,"What begins as a rather heavy lampooning gets lost in a series of first-rate slapstick acts and ends up as an idyll. Modern Tunes is, of course, funny picture; it Is also a very disappointing one.",4,4

Rotten Tomatoes,Denise Pieniazek,Once Upon A Time In Hollywood,"The film analyzes the functioning of entertainment industry, the social and ideological ethnic resentments and the construction of the American Dream.

Rotten Tomatoes,Kathy Fennessy,Once Upon A Time In Hollywood,"When [Sharon] Tate dances to Paul Revere and the Raiders, that's all we see: a woman dancing. If his cheery take on the actress has a lot of fantasy in it, that fairytale aspect is right there in the title: ""Once Upon a Time…""",3.5,4
Rotten Tomatoes,John Brhel,Once Upon A Time In Hollywood,"Not groundbreaking Tarantino, but it’s a fun trip back through time with real heart and likeable characters.

Rotten Tomatoes,John Brhel,Django Unchained 2012,"It might not be the most innovative in Tarantino’s oeuvre, but it’s got real stakes and memorable characters one can root for.

Rotten Tomatoes,Gene Siskel,Apocalypse Now,"It's precisely in the last 25 minutes that Apocalypse Now dissolves into gibberish.

Rotten Tomatoes,Bill Cosford,Apocalypse Now,"Though as high art this movie may have its problems, it is a complete movie, a huge piece of work that is at once a technical masterpiece and a thing of lyrical, lethal beauty. This will be the film to see in 1979.",2.5,4
Rotten Tomatoes,Frank Rich,Apocalypse Now,"Apocalypse Now is emotionally obtuse and intellectually empty. It is not so much an epic account of a grueling war as an incongruous, extravagant monument to artistic self-defeat.",2.5,4

Rotten Tomatoes,Ginger Varney,Apocalypse Now,"More than any movie I've ever seen, Apocalypse Now lessens the distance between civilian and soldier. Simply put, it makes war on an audience, and this gives the film great power and great beauty.",5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Wayne Harada,Apocalypse Now,"As entertainment, ""Apocalypse"" is spectacular and seductive, a fictional travelogue through the nightmares of warfare, with threads of reality blended with fantasy.",5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Joseph Gelmis,Apocalypse Now,"One of the very few must-see movies of 1979. It's brilliant, beautiful, thought-provoking and superbly acted, a horror movie and an adventure story, an important Vietnam War document.",3.5,4
Rotten Tomatoes,Jeanne Miller,Apocalypse Now,At once a major cinematic achievement and a major disappointment.,3,4

Rotten Tomatoes,Dean Johnson,Apocalypse Now,"Flaws and all, the genius of Coppola and his team can still enrich, stimulate, depress, provoke, horrify, probe. The faces will burn in memory; the places as well. Since film is a visual medium, that, perhaps, is enough.",4,4
Rotten Tomatoes,Clyde Gilmour,Apocalypse Now,"The resulting disappointment is a harsher blow than usual. What has gone before is so good that you passionately want the whole thing to be terrific. Until the last quarter spoils it, Apocalypse Now is simply one of the greatest movies ever made.",4,4

Rotten Tomatoes,Akhil Arora,Memento,"Memento places you in the mind of the protagonist in a fascinating way—by running it in reverse, you only know as much as the protagonist remembers—and that constantly makes you question what you’ve been told and what you see next.",A,A+
Rotten Tomatoes,Eddie Harrison,Memento,…one of the most demanding movies ever made…one of cinema’s most ornate puzzle-boxes…,5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Victoria Luxford,Memento,"Very complex detective thriller. Guy Pearce (leads) a terrific cast alongside Carrie Anne Moss. If you want to see the beginnings of how Nolan became such a big director, this is one to watch.",5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Paul Kanieski,Memento,"Memento ends as brilliantly as it begins, merging the two disparate timelines into one, and leaving us with a disquieting insight into human nature – that even fundamentally good people can gaslight themselves.",5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Cory Woodroof,Memento,"Nolan’s sophomore feature remains one of his most scintillating works, a noir for the ages draped in the pain of memories half-remembered and a future fully dependent on the past.",5,5

Rotten Tomatoes,Adam Kempenaar,Memento,"Think of all the ways that a linear film structure stabilizes us - the cause and effect chain of events. But Memento is about a character completely destabilized, so Nolan destabilizes us accordingly in a way maybe no other movie has.",5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Ed Travis,Memento,"Memento takes us on a mental trip of recovery, revenge, and remembering.",5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Joshua Rothkopf,Memento,"Memento would only be half as fun with only one gimmick or the other. Instead, the backward storytelling and the frozen man make for a wonderful pair, combining into something far more redemptive than it sounds.",5,5

Rotten Tomatoes,David Nusair,Memento,Christopher Nolan's cinematic breakthrough...,4,4

Rotten Tomatoes,Tyler Christian,Wall E,"Although the title character's arc is juxtaposed by the troubling dystopia on the Axiom, it nonetheless brings light to both Pixar's gloriously unique protagonists and real-world issues.",2,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Glenn Kenny,Wall E,"Although Wall-E ends with a very apt and moving nod to City Lights, it is in fact Pixar's answer to Modern Times-both a bravura summation of everything the studio is great at and a ""You ain't seen nothing yet!"" statement of purpose.",2,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Dorothy Woodend,Wall E,"If Wall-E has anything original to say, it takes place in the first 30 minutes on a planet heaped high with junk. But the parallels between fiction and reality are almost too painful to contemplate.",2,5

Rotten Tomatoes,Roger Ebert,Raiders Of The Lost Ark,"[Raiders of the Lost Ark] grabs you in the first shot, hurtles you through a series of incredible adventures, and deposits you back in reality two hours later -- breathless, dizzy, wrung-out, and with a silly grin on your face.",4,4
Rotten Tomatoes,John Brosnan,Raiders Of The Lost Ark,"A glorious mixture of spectacular, fast-paced action and sly humor.",4,4
Rotten Tomatoes,Sheila Benson,Raiders Of The Lost Ark,"There was the almost exhausting excitement of the film itself.

Rotten Tomatoes,Eleanor Ringel Cater,Raiders Of The Lost Ark,"Raiders is the most fun to hit the screen since movies came in chapters. Reportedly, there are further adventures of Indiana Jones in the works. Let's hope so. Something this good deserves To Be Continued.",4,4
Rotten Tomatoes,Patrick Taggart,Raiders Of The Lost Ark,"It is, in short, a reminder of the very reason we go to movies.

Rotten Tomatoes,Vern Stefanic,Raiders Of The Lost Ark,"After watching just the first five minutes of Raiders of the Lost Ark, you’re hooked.

Rotten Tomatoes,Jack Garner,Raiders Of The Lost Ark,"Raiders is as snappy as the crack of a whip, as daring as a leap over a snake-infested ravine, as rowdy as a fistfight in a grimy bar in Nepal, and as much fun as you could ever want in a film.",5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Bruce R. Miller,Raiders Of The Lost Ark,"[Raiders of the Lost Ark] is destined for some kind of popcorn immortality. Rare in this world of one-shot communication, it makes one want to see it again and again. Without question, it's the best film of the summer.",5,5

Rotten Tomatoes,Kshitij Rawat,Avengers Infinity War,Avengers: Infinity War is full of entertaining little parts that somehow do not make a compelling whole. It is a phantasmagoria of stunning action sequences and beautifully poignant moments that nevertheless leaves one cold in the end.,B+,A+
Rotten Tomatoes,Mike Massie,Avengers Infinity War,"There's nothing new about Marvel's money-raking formula, but as each new chapter comes along, the serialized story becomes more and more unwieldy.",6,10

Rotten Tomatoes,Nell Dodson Russell,Sunset Boulevard,"My nomination for the best movie of the year so far is Sunset Boulevard, starring Gloria Swanson and William Holden.

Rotten Tomatoes,Virginia Graham,Sunset Boulevard,"The direction is by Billy Wilder who did Lost Weekend, and it is superb -- detailed, evocative and absorbing.

Rotten Tomatoes,Keith Garlington,Paths Of Glory,The film also excels thanks to Kubrick’s visual choices particularly his decision to shoot in black and white. It is perfect considering the harshness of the material and the morally murky waters we navigate through.,4,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Danielle Solzman,Paths Of Glory,"Language issues notwithstanding, Stanley Kubrick certainly knows what he's doing with Paths of Glory.",4,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Dilys Powell,Paths Of Glory,"Mr. Kubrick has not been able to inject into figures which are literary and alien from the rough vitality which so naturally flowed [in The Killing]. Nevertheless, Paths of Glory in its authority, its piercingness, is an extraordinary film.",4,5

Rotten Tomatoes,David Parkinson,Witness For The Prosecution,Wilder's adaptation is guilty of being absolutely marvelous.,4.5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Emanuel Levy,Witness For The Prosecution,"This Oscar-nominated courtroom drama represents Billy Wilder at his most theatrical and old-fashioned, but the saga is enjoyable and so is the acting of all-star cast.",B+,A+
Rotten Tomatoes,Sarah Vincent,Shining,"Despite The Outlook’s advantages, a hysterical, bookworm, couch potato, chain smoking wife beats it. Kubrick did not intend to create a film about evil’s Achilles heel, but I left with that message. Be a mess, but fight.",B+,A+

Rotten Tomatoes,Manuel São Bento,Shining,"The Shining might be one of the most accessible classics to new viewers of today to understand why it is, in fact, one of the greatest and most influential horror films of all time. The ending is still mind-blowing after all these years.",A+,A+
Rotten Tomatoes,Wesley Lovell,Shining,"Yet, The Shining, which was his third to last film, was akin to the genre films of his past such as Dr. Strangelove and 2001: A Space Odyssey where he explored the essence of humanity in a way unlike any other filmmaker.",4,4
Rotten Tomatoes,Jay Scott,Shining,Kubrick sabotages his own thesis in the most knuckleheaded way conceivable: we can't be charged as accomplices in horror when there is no horror.,4,4
Rotten Tomatoes,John Brosnan,Shining,"Kubrick, however, doesn't really seem interested in the ""shining"" or in the hotel's supernatural forces generally... The result is a movie fatally flawed artistically.",4,4

Rotten Tomatoes,David Denby,Shining,"There are a few terrific thrills, and some eerie moments of dislocation that only Kubrick could achieve, but most of the movie is unfelt, unscary, and bizarrely heavy-handed. It's the first pompous haunted-house movie.",9,10
Rotten Tomatoes,Brian Eggert,Shining,"The terrifying aspect of The Shining, and its most enduring quality, is how Kubrick has trapped us in his cinematic maze to search without hope of ever discovering an adequate answer outside of our own making.",4,4

Rotten Tomatoes,Rob Aldam,Great Dictator,"It works wonderfully, but The Great Dictator will perhaps be remembered most fondly for Chaplin’s moving closing speech.",4,4
Rotten Tomatoes,Dilys Powell,Great Dictator,For me the film contained one major error: the final speech... This finale is so blatantly out of harmony with what has gone before as to nullify much of the effectiveness of the preceding two hours.,4,4
Rotten Tomatoes,André Bazin,Great Dictator,"It is not... the genius of Chaplin that permitted him to create The Great Dictator. It was nothing but that moustache. The Tramp waited for the right moment, did what he had to do, then escaped for all eternity with his facial hair intact.",4,4

Rotten Tomatoes,Tim Dirks,Great Dictator,"The Great Dictator (1940) is director/actor Charlie Chaplin's first full all-talking (""talkie"" with dialogue) picture (in a film similar to the Marx Brothers' anti-war comedy Duck Soup (1933)) in which he delivered spoken lines...",A+,A+

Rotten Tomatoes,Franz Hoellering,Great Dictator,The only trouble is that such perfect scenes as this are followed by more conventional passages which would be funny enough in an average picture but let one down in a film that deals so ambitiously with so great a theme.,5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Philip Martin,Great Dictator,"...a great movie because it works as a film, and because it is a document of courage and faith, the prime exhibit in Chaplin's humanist brief ... Dictator is a comedy, the work of a clown, but it is no joke. Chaplin had lethal intent.",90,100

Rotten Tomatoes,Mark Johnson,Amadeus,"Lavish and flamboyant in every manner. F. Murray Abraham’s vile and sinister performance as the envious Salieri, a man with more desire to produce music than God gave him talent to create, is one for the ages.",3.5,4
Rotten Tomatoes,Jay Scott,Amadeus,"Decorated with a powdered-sugar sweetness and creamy lavishness unseen since the days of Josef von Sternberg, and performed by an eager to please, rootin'-tootin' American cast that would be comfortable in Oklahoma!, Amadeus is junk food par excellence.",3.5,4

Rotten Tomatoes,Marsha McCreadie,Amadeus,"What has happened in the long-awaited, much-acclaimed Miloš Forman film, with its script by Shaffer, is that the popularization has gone so broad and so far afield of its elevated subject as to make that subject seem ridiculous.",4,4
Rotten Tomatoes,Scott Cain,Amadeus,"Peter Shaffer's Amadeus is scrumptiously beautiful, sizzlingly alive and bristling with social comedy. His screenplay contains the most piercing account of deadly envy since Othello, and is a heartbreaking account of a good man's fall from grace.",4,4
Rotten Tomatoes,Bob Thomas,Amadeus,Amadeus on the Broadway stage was a dazzling feat of dramaturgy. Miloš Forman has fashioned it into a stunning motion picture.,4,4

Rotten Tomatoes,Howard Waldstein,High And Low,"In any other director's hands, High and Low would be a crime-of-the-week story. Instead, elevated by Akira Kurosawa's masterful compositions, methodical pacing, and one of the best uses of color in film, it's a masterpiece.",4,5

Rotten Tomatoes,Keith Garlington,The Hunt 2019,The idea at the core of “The Hunt” is a worthy one. We could certainly use a clear-eyed reminder of how toxic and sectarian our political discourse has become. I’m just not sure this is the movie to do it.,2,5

Rotten Tomatoes,Maurice Rapf,2001 A Space Odyssey,"I'm not so sure many of us in the audience knew what Kubrick's enigmatic tableaux were all about, but I do know that few of us would ever look into the night sky again without a new sense of wonder about man and the universe.",5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Ted Mahar,2001 A Space Odyssey,"While [Stanley Kubrick] dazzles, bewilders and overpowers the viewer with gadgetry and technology, he has utilized cinematic form in a distinctive non-verbal way.

Rotten Tomatoes,Clifford Terry,2001 A Space Odyssey,"The first loss in Kubrick's fantastic winning streak. A decided disappointment in every respect except the visual, ""Space Odyssey"" perhaps will convince the extraordinarily-talented director to leave the future to Dr. Carlson, and come back down to earth.",5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Wayne Harada,2001 A Space Odyssey,"It may seem ponderously pretentious to assume that man will be up, up and away like that, but Kubrick's foreplay is enriching and extraordinarily perceptive, if nothing else. Indeed, he tells it like it possibly will be -- with authority.",5,5

Rotten Tomatoes,Terry Ryan,2001 A Space Odyssey,Stanley Kubrick's 2001 is a space-age origin of species. It's an epic of evolution. Like Homer's Odyssey its primary function seems to be to give its audience a sense of their history.,5,5

Rotten Tomatoes,Jay Carr,Reservoir Dogs,"And while Tarantino never quite succeeds in putting around each character the sense of isolation that marks the best noirs, he carries off this exercise in lively fashion. It's more purple than noir, but it's got juice.",4,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Derek Malcolm,Reservoir Dogs,No one should go to Reservoir Dogs without prior thought. But what they will see is a riveting treatise on the theme of betrayal set in an urban wasteland that murders hope and makes redemption virtually impossible.,4,5

Rotten Tomatoes,James Baldwin,Lawrence Of Arabia,"It may be said that the weary melancholy underlying Lawrence of Arabia stems from the stupefying apprehension that, whereas England may have been doomed to civilize the world, no power under heaven can civilize England.",3.5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Mark Johnson,Lawrence Of Arabia,"As the larger-than-life, controversial, and complicated titular T.E. Lawrence, Peter O’Toole gives one of the singular performances in the history of film. His immense onscreen presence is a worthy juxtaposition for the man he portrays.",3.5,5

Rotten Tomatoes,Douglas Davidson,Lawrence Of Arabia,"This is an epic, not just because it runs nearly four hours, but because of the measured and deliberate pacing, tangible sets and action sequences, and the willingness to explore humankind’s folly due to pride and greed.",5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Josh Parham,Lawrence Of Arabia,"The film is impeccably designed from every element on the screen, and words can often fail to accurately describe the elegance that is crafted.",9,10
Rotten Tomatoes,Brian Eggert,Lawrence Of Arabia,"This motion picture is unlike any epic because after enduring so many perils in an enormous journey, the size of which had never been seen in a Hollywood production, the questions about T.E. Lawrence remain.",4,4

Rotten Tomatoes,Marylynn Uricchio,Scarface,"Working from Oliver Stone's script, De Palma shapes a chilling, unpleasant but perversely entertaining portrait of the cocaine business. To his credit, its 2 hours and 45 minutes fly by like so many bullets.",2,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Joe Baltake,Scarface,"Scarface is vile, sordid, dispiriting and degrading for all involved. It's major flaws, however, are its overall dullness and disorganization.",2,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Stephen Hunter,Scarface,"For a time, it seems to be on the way toward greatness, but then -- perhaps reflecting the descent of its protagonist -- it tumbles into mediocrity.",2,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Eleanor Ringel Cater,Scarface,"There's too much expertise, too much sheer love of movie-making up there on the screen for Scarface to be deemed a failure. But the director's failure to follow through makes this a too-long movie that comes up short.",2,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Eddie Harrison,Scarface,…packs the punch of a grenade-launcher…,5,5

Rotten Tomatoes,Brian D. Johnson,The Heat,"There are some sharp, observational touches behind the antic comedy. And during the lulls in the action there are some sensitive time-outs between the co-stars that almost feel they belong in another movie.",3,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Mattie Lucas,The Heat,"The main appeal here is clearly the two leads, and indeed Bullock and McCarthy are a comedic dream team.",3,4
Rotten Tomatoes,Craig Williams,The Heat,"There's a distinctive feeling that we are watching jokes as they are being constructed. Feig is liable to let the camera just run as McCarthy fires off a dozen lines on a topic, causing the jokes to feel badly strung out.",2,5

Rotten Tomatoes,Jay Carmody,North By Northwest,"The acting in North by Northwest has that brilliant, cool surface that represents the perfect polish for the best of Hitchcock. Grant, to be sure, is the director's Number 1 hand at this sort of thing. Mason, nevertheless, comes close to matching him.",4,4
Rotten Tomatoes,Harold V. Cohen,North By Northwest,"Very little of it makes sense, but no matter. From the moment Mr. Cary Grant, a Madison Avenue advertising man, is kidnaped by a band of foreign agents who think he's someone else, North By Northwest stays on a rollercoaster that operates on laughing gas.",4,4
Rotten Tomatoes,John L. Scott,North By Northwest,"Grant's technique, so well established, shines brightly under Hitchcock's guidance. The two seem completely en rapport in movie making.

Rotten Tomatoes,John Rico,Full Metal Jacket,"One of the classics of war cinema, it's not nearly as good as its legend suggests. But it's pretty good.",,
Rotten Tomatoes,Peter Travers,Full Metal Jacket,"[Kubrick's] genius, and perhaps burden, is to see the insanity in us all and to make it seem so terrifyingly normal.",,
Rotten Tomatoes,David Nusair,Full Metal Jacket,...a justifiably iconic war film.,3.5,4
Rotten Tomatoes,Tim Brayton,Full Metal Jacket,"One of Kubrick's foremost triumphs, a genuinely challenging and uncomfortable war film",10,10
Rotten Tomatoes,Terrence Rafferty,Full Metal Jacket,"No amount of stylistic analysis, however, is likely to explain why a man would devote more than three years of his life to making a war movie in which violent death isn't meant to move us. Does Kubrick really think we're not callous enough about war?",10,10
Rotten Tomatoes,Adrian Turner,Full Metal Jacket,While its message is simple -- innocent young Americans are taught to be machine-like killers -- its technique is extraordinary.,5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Gary Wolcott,Vertigo,Vertigo drones on for two-thirds of the movie before Hitchcock switches gears and moves the film to the level it should have been all along.,3.5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Chris Barsanti,Vertigo,"Viewed by many at the time as a departure for Alfred Hitchcock, 'Vertigo' can be seen as a return to form ... redolent of spookier works like 'Rebecca' or 'Spellbound,' with a psychoanalytic frame instead of gothic romanticism.",3.5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Joseph Tomastik,Vertigo,"It may take a while to work up to its thriller elements, but it 100% earns its right to be called a thriller, and one of the best, most understated, and ingenious of all time at that.",5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Tom Hutchinson,Vertigo,This remains one of the most painful depictions of romantic fatalism in all of cinema.,5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Adam Kempenaar,Vertigo,Once it switches over to us getting inside her head... I started seeing it more as Judy's story than Scottie's.,4.5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Sebastian Zavala Kahn,Vertigo,"It's a product of its time (especially when it comes to the treatment of the female characters), and it's not trying to be just a thriller. Rather, it is a story about a doomed romance that turns into a dangerous obsession. Full review in Spanish.",4.5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Zita Short,Vertigo,Novak feels like she was left out to dry by Hitchcock as he spent far more time paying attention to the location of the brooch on her lapel than he spent instructing her on how to convey her character’s emotions.,4.5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Wesley Lovell,Vertigo,Vertigo is a film with numerous layers that can be discussed in depth and at length. That’s not to say it isn’t also an enjoyable film. Hitchcock knew how to make them. That’s why his films are generally beloved by critics and audiences alike.,4,4
Rotten Tomatoes,Olly Richards,Vertigo,It is a story of obsession and control...,4,4
Rotten Tomatoes,Dennis Harvey,Vertigo,"Those eccentricities have since become accepted, defended, and loved...",4,4
Rotten Tomatoes,Dilys Powell,Vertigo,"The plot is a brilliant box of devilish tricks. And yet the film disappoints. It seems too long, too elaborately designed; the narration of this kind of criminal intrigue sags under such luscious treatment; it needs the touch of the harsh and the squalid.",4,4
Rotten Tomatoes,Jack Moffitt,Vertigo,"Alfred Hitchcock tops his own fabulous record for suspense with Vertigo, a super-tale of murder, madness and mysticism that stars James Stewart and Kim Novak.",4,4
Rotten Tomatoes,P.S. Harrison,Vertigo,"This latest Alfred Hitchcock ""thrillorama"" offers further evidence of his mastery in mystery and suspense, for, despite its flaws, it grips one's attention from start to finish.",4,4
Rotten Tomatoes,Brian Eggert,Vertigo,A motion picture of incomparable dramatic involvement and hypnotic filmmaking.,4,4
Rotten Tomatoes,Kevin Carr,Vertigo,"It's probably the most impeccably put together Hitchcock movie... but ultimately it's men trying to control women, and that doesn't ring very well right now.",3,4
Rotten Tomatoes,Sarah Brinks,Vertigo,"Jimmy Stewart is an actor who always delivers, especially in the films he did with Hitchcock. Scottie isn't my favorite character he played but it really is a wonderful performance.",3,4
Rotten Tomatoes,Scott Nye,Vertigo,"Hitchcock is often spoken about regarding his ""perfectionism,"" this way every shot is carefully arranged and the edits hit like a knife. That's no less true here...",3,4
Rotten Tomatoes,Mike Massie,Vertigo,"One of Hitchcock's finest achievements, layering drama, a love story, adventure, and hair-raising suspense into a psychological murder-mystery that simply has no peers.",10,10
Rotten Tomatoes,Allen Almachar,Vertigo,"If the cinema was [Hitchcock's] church, this film was his confession.",10,10
Rotten Tomatoes,Joanne Laurier,Vertigo,"[Its] meticulous realism both indicts and empathizes with Scottie's squeezed, linear policeman mentality at odds with other, more profound longings, which depend, in the final analysis, on a radical change in social circumstances.",10,10
Rotten Tomatoes,Ray Pride,Amelie,"Snapshot of an idealized version of [Montmartre]... fate, joy, momentary despair and still more joy. It’s filled with lists of likes and dislikes and Jeunet’s restless need to entertain makes <i>Amélie</i> a list in itself.",9,10

Rotten Tomatoes,Roger Ebert,Amelie,"Amelie is a delicious pastry of a movie, a lighthearted fantasy in which a winsome heroine overcomes a sad childhood and grows up to bring cheer to the needful and joy to herself. You see it, and later when you think about it, you smile.",3.5,4
Rotten Tomatoes,Sandra Hall,Amelie,"Jeunet [turns] the whole story into a comic strip with the inventiveness of his exaggerations, the terseness of his ironies, the briskness of his editing and a voiceover commentary which would have done Roald Dahl proud.",3.5,4
Rotten Tomatoes,Michael D. Reid,Amelie,"Like its title character, Amelie is a quirky, unabashedly manipulative charmer that, while endearing at first, overstays its welcome. Until the visual pyrotechnics and faux joie de vivre become too overbearing, however, [it's] a captivating confection.",3,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Dennis King,Amelie,"An utterly fresh, imaginative and emotional piece of filmmaking that s touched by enough sheer magic to lift the spirits of even the most hardened cynic.",4,4

Rotten Tomatoes,Sean Nelson,Amelie,"Through all our isolation and division, we are united by love. If it takes an uplifting fantasy to state this idea, however whimsically and indirectly, then so much the better. Of course it's not real... What good's a fairy tale without a moral, anyway?",C,A+
Rotten Tomatoes,Hap Erstein,Amelie,"It is the feel-good escapist film that most of us need right now, but with a frequent twist of tartness and a cinematic giddiness that intoxicates.",4,4
Rotten Tomatoes,Jay Stone,Amelie,Amélie is the happy ending to a year that most of us would just as soon forget. This is a film to remind us of the urgent importance of frivolity.,4,4

Rotten Tomatoes,Marshall Fine,Amelie,It’s a lighter-than-air French pastry of a film that will have you begging for more.,3.5,4
Rotten Tomatoes,Scott Vogel,Amelie,"It's a delirious funhouse of a movie that's an unrepentant crowd pleaser, and one that French tourism officials probably welcomed with open arms.",3,4

Rotten Tomatoes,Stephanie Archer,Die Hard,"One of the most divisive holiday classics, the argument on whether John McTiernan's Die Hard is a Christmas movie, finds its way to the forefront every year. For myself, the truth is indisputable. Die Hard is a Christmas film - no, a Christmas classic.",4,5
Rotten Tomatoes,David Hogan,Die Hard,"To say Die Hard still holds up is an understatement: charismatic protagonist and antagonist, great action set pieces, well paced and a top class finale. It’s no wonder so many other films and TV series continue to “do a Die Hard”, it’s still hard to top.",5,5

Rotten Tomatoes,Keith Garlington,1020130-Sting,There's a playful allure that permeates much of the film and it has a cool retro style that calls back to the classic mob movies of Raoul Walsh and Lloyd Bacon. But it also has a touch of 1970s grit which helps sets it apart.,4,5

Rotten Tomatoes,Nadine Whitney,Indiana Jones And The Dial Of Destiny,"Indiana Jones and The Dial of Destiny is made with nostalgia at its core and embraces the pulpy silliness of the whole franchise.

Rotten Tomatoes,Carla Renata,The Wolf Of Wall Street 2013,"Film is hella long, but the performances are to die for from DiCaprio, Margot Robbie, Matthew McConaughty. Not to mention that this madness is based on the true story of Jordan Belfort. So outrageous you would swear it wasn't real! It is!",9,10
Rotten Tomatoes,David Harris,The Wolf Of Wall Street 2013,"Martin Scorsese roars back to the screen with The Wolf of Wall Street, a three-hour marathon stuffed with dark humor, gross-out gags, a fistful of Quaaludes and one awesome performance by Leonardo DiCaprio.",4.5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Ryan Syrek,The Wolf Of Wall Street 2013,Trim an hour of the repetitive smut and insert a cohesive thesis for DiCaprio's performance to rely on and maybe this would have earned all the praise it has received.,B-,A+
Rotten Tomatoes,Nicholas Bell,The Wolf Of Wall Street 2013,"Terence Winter, creator and writer of The Sopranos, has written a marvelously comedic script, with howlingly funny bits of dialogue. But perhaps its most magnificent accent is the delightful DiCaprio in perhaps his best union yet with Scorsese.",4,5

Rotten Tomatoes,Wael Khairy,Taxi Driver,"The viewer has no choice, we are forced to breathe the air, gaze through the pupils, and experience the city by slipping into the shoes of a twisted protagonist, the shoe laces tightly tied by none other than a master of his craft, Scorsese.",5,5

Rotten Tomatoes,Desmond Ryan,Taxi Driver,"It works its strange alchemy with riveting force… With this extraordinary film, Scorsese confirms his standing among our finest young directors. It is, among other things, a testament to the versatility that last produced Alice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore.",4.5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Janet Maslin,Taxi Driver,"Experiencing the film on an insulated, intellectual level is a virtual impossibility, thanks to a central performance so individualized and affecting that Travis is never in danger of becoming a statistic or a symbol.",4.5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,John Huddy,Taxi Driver,"The bonds are close and tight between Scorsese's first film and his most recent effort. And yet Taxi Driver stands alone. It is original, harrowing, instant American mythology.",4.5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Kevin Kelly,Taxi Driver,"Taxi Driver is so volatile it nearly explodes from the screen. Under Martin Scorsese's brilliant direction, it works a dramatic tension that is inescapable, carefully, systematically straitjacketing its audience in the problems of its central character.",4.5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Cynthia Genser,Taxi Driver,"Scorsese has spit all his disgust right in our faces. Well, you don't have to like it. But when the doors of the [theater] opened to let us out, there was New York and I knew, I knew it was no longer possible to avoid the horror.",4.5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Gene Siskel,Taxi Driver,"Remove the cataclysmic ending from Taxi Driver and it would be one smashingly good motion picture. As it stands, the film is beautiful to look at, exciting to listen to, but much too much to stomach.",3,4
Rotten Tomatoes,Charles Champlin,Taxi Driver,"Whatever else anybody comes to think about Taxi Driver, it has a muscle-tensing, skin-prickling, apprehensive suspense that builds from those first unsettling moments like an air-raid siren.",3,4
Rotten Tomatoes,John Simon,Taxi Driver,"All these things might be reconciled and resolved, if only the film probed deeper instead of trying merely to astonish and dazzle. Obviously, it is the offspring of an unholy union.",3,4
Rotten Tomatoes,Frank Rich,Taxi Driver,"Like any genuine nightmare, Taxi Driver induces terror because its hideousness grows out of pure, if awful, human truth.",3,4
Rotten Tomatoes,Jack Kroll,Taxi Driver,"Scorsese and cinematographer Michael Chapman create a funky, overripe New York that's like a nightmare Travis can never stop dreaming... But first and last Taxi Driver belongs to Robert De Niro, the most remarkable young actor of the American screen.",3,4
Rotten Tomatoes,Stanley Kauffmann,Taxi Driver,Even if [the actors] were all better -- and part of the picture's trouble is that there is no way for them to be much better -- Taxi Driver would still be no more than the 1976 dark-mirror image of 1936 romance.,3,4
Rotten Tomatoes,Joe Pollack,Taxi Driver,"Taxi Driver is a fascinating film. It is strong and moving, and it often affects the emotions like a blow to the stomach. It is not for the squeamish, but it is one superior piece of motion picture artistry.",3,4

Rotten Tomatoes,Rex Reed,Taxi Driver,"Scorsese is obviously talented. He knows how to build mood, tension and atmosphere... But he's short on coherence where it matters most. His films are beginning to look like they've been made by a promising upstart who believes his own press clippings.",3,4
Rotten Tomatoes,Stanley Eichelbaum,Taxi Driver,The director has created a highly effective profile of an incipient killer and De Niro's portrayal of the obsessively mad Travis is terrifically convincing.,3,4
Rotten Tomatoes,Hal Crowther,Taxi Driver,"Taxi Driver is shocking and indulgent, and it's compelling. I don't think I agree with it or even approve of it, but I couldn't help admiring it.",3,4

Rotten Tomatoes,Richard Crouse,Hamilton 2020,"Miranda's daring, genre busting show speaks for itself, often with beautiful tongue-twisting wordplay, and doesn't need flashy cinematic theatrics to bolster what is already a provocative and timely story of creating a union where none existed.",4.5,5

Rotten Tomatoes,Ben Pearson,Hamilton 2020,"This is a stage show with cameras capturing the action, and while I appreciated seeing it, I felt like there were missed opportunities to editorialize a little more and draw deeper visual connections than what the proscenium of a stage could provide.",7,10

Rotten Tomatoes,Robert Roten,Hamilton 2020,"This two and a half hour movie covers a lot of events that happen over a period of many years, but it manages to do all this at a very lively pace. The songs, both rap and more traditional theatrical songs are well-written and performed.",B+,A+

Rotten Tomatoes,Keith Garlington,Green Book,The biggest strength lies in the chemistry between Mortensen and Ali. Without it the entire movie would fall apart.,3.5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,M.N. Miller,Green Book,"Green Book is not for the cold-hearted cynic, but for the romantic moviegoer who wants nothing more than to see the good in people and let that feeling wash over them.",4,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Brian Eggert,Green Book,"Tears will be shed, laughs will be had, and crowds will love it. The viewer might not always feel good about how those reactions are achieved; despite the overwhelming feel-goodness of the experience, you can see Green Book's gears operating.",3,4
Rotten Tomatoes,Ben Turner,Green Book,"This is a deftly scripted comedy with a message. Anchored by two outstanding performances, this true story of an unlikely friendship will warm even the most jaded of hearts with its comic look on a dark chapter of American history.",4,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Nicolás Delgadillo,Green Book,It's irresponsible and dismissive of the very thing it seemingly wants to talk about.,,
Rotten Tomatoes,Alex Bentley,Green Book,"With so many other recent movies finding a way to address racial issues in both entertaining and considerate methods, Green Book feels like a wrongheaded throwback. It may give you some good feelings, but its message is only half-baked.",,
Rotten Tomatoes,Joanne Laurier,Green Book,"For its humanistic, anti-racialist message-the elementary notion that white and black people can get along-Green Book has been well received by audiences.",,
Rotten Tomatoes,Richard Crouse,Green Book,"Probably could have hit a little harder but its message of unity, of creating bridges rather than walls, is a welcome one in these politically divisive times.",4,5

Rotten Tomatoes,Ned Lannamann,The Kid 2019,"It's all pretty conspicuously average, but The Kid comes to life in its second half, when Hawke takes center stage. Unsurprisingly, he's the best thing in the movie by a country mile.",3,4
Rotten Tomatoes,Sarah Ksiazek,The Kid 2019,"What comes from this casting are some questionable scenes where acting was not on par with other performances in the film. Had some other actors been cast, the film could have come off stronger but instead felt stunted and off in several scenes.",C,A+

Rotten Tomatoes,Denise Pieniazek,The Father 2021,"A psychological drama that has the originality of narrating the action from the point of view of an older man, through which the viewer must discover if he suffers from some type of senile dementia, or if it is his environment who wants harm him.",9,10
Rotten Tomatoes,Sarah Vincent,The Father 2021,Trigger warning: do not watch “The Father” (2020) if you are unprepared to be completely gutted and devastated. Side effects may include life altering change in perspective and emerging fear of aging in the US.,9,10

Rotten Tomatoes,Akos Peterbencze,The Father 2021,"Through our protagonist’s mental condition, we witness how human consciousness turns against us.

Rotten Tomatoes,Dilys Powell,1000626-All About Eve,"It is a very long piece, and it often seems long, though never when Bette Davis is on the screen; Miss Davis as the Broadway star, insolent, stormy, waspish and terrified of growing old, is magnificent.",5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Pauline Kael,1000626-All About Eve,"Joseph L. Mankiewicz's bad taste, exhibited with verve, is more fun than careful, mousy, dehydrated good taste.

Rotten Tomatoes,Christopher Connor,1067987-Casino,Casino is a film showing a director at the top of his game in the middle of an especially hot streak. If not Scorsese’s strongest effort it is certainly worthy of appreciation.,4,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Sean Axmaker,1067987-Casino,"Scorsese spends the first half of the sprawling three-hour epic laying out the entire operation in fascinating detail... and last half watching it all unravel through greed, arrogance, hubris, and the unleashed, monstrous id of Pesci’s blood simple thug..",4,5

Rotten Tomatoes,Adam Nayman,1067987-Casino,"Without stinting on the viciousness, Scorsese still conveys an element of nostalgia in Casino, although it's less because the movie is convinced by Ace and Nicky's vision of the good old days than it is skepticism over what will eventually replace them.",3.5,4
