metacritic,mickrussom,minecraft,"Minecraft 2025 is a colossal misfire that makes you wonder how anyone could fumble a property as endlessly creative as Minecraft this badly especially when Super Mario proved video game adaptations can be vibrant, fun, and worth watching. Instead of a blocky wonderland bursting with imagination, we get a soulless, corporate cash-grab that's as uninspired as a dirt hut built by a first-day player. And at the center of this mess is Jack Black, whose over-the-top shtick as Steve feels less like a character and more like a bloated, annoying caricature of himself phoning it in with the energy **** who ate too many pork chops and forgot what made his Bowser a good character.Where Super Mario delivered a tight, colorful romp with a villain you couldn't help but like to hate, Minecraft stumbles through a plot so thin it could've been scribbled on a 3x5 card with a fat sharpie. The live action gimmick is a disaster with corpulent Jack Black waddling around in a turquoise shirt against a green screen looks less like an adventure and more like a sad clown act at a kid's party no one showed up to. His constant mugging and forced musical numbers grate on the nerves, turning Steve into a flabby, loud distraction instead of the everyman hero Minecraft fans **** visuals? A garish mishmash of CGI and real world actors that clash worse than a creeper in a flower biome. The charm of Minecraft's pixelated freedom is buried under a generic 'save the world' story that feels like it was ripped from a dozen better films none of which bothered to star a Jack Black who seems to think yelling and flailing is a substitute for depth. Super Mario knew how to balance nostalgia with heart; this just shovels Easter eggs and tired gags into a pit and calls it a day. It's not just terrible it's a betrayal of everything that makes Minecraft special, leaving you longing for the Mushroom Kingdom instead of this blockheaded bore.TLDR - Jack Black ruined this movie and he is a bloated slob who phoned it in.",0,10
metacritic,HaloBlues,minecraft,"Man. It's Minecraft.

It's not a game that immediately comes to mind when I think about my all-time favourites, but after some consideration I believe it warrants a place on that list for its longevity, its sentimental value, how easy it is as a method of bringing people together, and how broad and full of possibilities it is as an avenue for almost any kind of world or game-within-a-game you can think of.",10,10

Its simple visuals hide an endlessly deep and rewarding experience that allows players to explore, build, survive, and express themselves with total freedom.Whether you’re playing survival mode, where resource gathering and creativity meet tension and strategy, or building massive structures in creative mode, Minecraft adapts to your imagination. Its sandbox nature makes it fun for all ages, and the sheer amount of user-generated content, mods, and community servers keeps it fresh and constantly evolving.While the lack of direction might not appeal to everyone, that’s part of its brilliance—it’s a game you shape entirely on your own terms.A timeless, genre-defining masterpiece.10/10",10,10

Minecraft being the literal game of the generation is something everyone has heard of. With its viral gameplay on YouTube and still being in the top spot after 14+ years, it just keeps improving. Having the creative liberty to do pretty much anything and I do mean ANYTHING! People have built from small farms to literal 1:1 city and even computers that work inside of Minecraft, there is no limit to what you can think of. The game offers amazing exploitation with its unique generative worlds and a base survival story which you don’t even need to complete to be honest to experience the best of the game. The updates are just icing on the cake with cool stuff coming out each year to make the game even better and more explorative. The Community keeps adding amazing mods and servers to experience the game is more than a million ways so you never get **** in all, if you have never played a single game in your life and want to start, let it be Minecraft! That’s all I’m going to say.

PROS:
-	Unlimited Creativity and Exploration
-	Survival elements that are not overwhelming for beginners.
-	Cool updates every year to keep the experience going!
-	You don’t need to follow the base plot to enjoy the game.
-	Modding makes the experience that much better.

metacritic,AtomicTyrant11,minecraft,"Wherever I'm traversing the great plains in search of a village, a peaceful, exiting place of opportunity full of big nosed buffoons thats I love deeply yet also despise depending on there trades. Fighting for my life as I navigate through the dark caves keeping my eyes open, my shied ready and lighting up all of my steps with torches in search of precious diamonds. Against hell as I survive the nether or explore the many other biomes. Minecraft can be beautiful experience In single player survival mode. Whenever I’m farming, mining, fighting, exploring, building or roleplaying It is a nostalgic experience. The multiplayer aspect of this game is equally as great. Some of my earliest memories of gaming… actually in general Is playing split screen minecraft with my brother on the PS4, XBox One and then later on the switch then PS5. As of march 2025 I have only recently got into realms and am building civilizations and talking over the overworld most of the nether with a bunch of friends. Now with constant update (Game Drops) MInecraft is now as revisitable as ever! Despite the simple blocky world it comes alive with In my opinion one of the best original soundtracks.. Ever and the many adorable animals, sinister beasts and everything In between make this pixelated masterpiece come alive. Not to mention the millions of character customisation options, Add ons and mods and online servers! By the way Aria Math is peak!

Nota: 10/10

Minecraft é mais do que um jogo; é um fenômeno cultural que oferece possibilidades infinitas de criação, exploração e diversão. Desenvolvido pela Mojang, o título continua a encantar jogadores de todas as idades com sua simplicidade e profundidade únicas.

A principal força de Minecraft é sua liberdade. Você pode explorar mundos gerados aleatoriamente, construir estruturas incríveis, enfrentar perigos em cavernas ou simplesmente relaxar enquanto cria sua própria história. O modo sobrevivência desafia os jogadores com a coleta de recursos, construção de abrigo e combate contra criaturas hostis, enquanto o modo criativo libera a imaginação sem limites.

A verdadeira magia, porém, está em jogar com amigos. Criar um mundo juntos, explorar biomas desconhecidos, construir cidades ou enfrentar o Ender Dragon em equipe torna a experiência incrivelmente divertida e memorável. As interações sociais adicionam um elemento de imprevisibilidade e alegria, seja ajudando um amigo a construir uma mansão ou se envolvendo em ""pegadinhas"" criativas.

A simplicidade visual do jogo, com seus gráficos em blocos, é charmosa e intencional, permitindo que o foco esteja na criatividade e na jogabilidade. A trilha sonora calma e melancólica de C418 complementa perfeitamente o ambiente, criando uma experiência relaxante e imersiva.

Além disso, a vasta comunidade e os mods ampliam ainda mais as possibilidades, tornando Minecraft uma plataforma em constante evolução. De minijogos a servidores personalizados, sempre há algo novo para experimentar.

Minecraft é mais do que um jogo: é uma ferramenta para criatividade, aprendizado e conexão entre pessoas. Com uma experiência que pode ser tanto solitária quanto profundamente colaborativa, ele merece nota máxima por sua acessibilidade, diversão interminável e impacto cultural.

Seja sozinho ou com amigos, Minecraft é sempre uma aventura inesquecível.",10,10

If you want a randomly generated ice climb, play survival mode and look for a nice icy mountain to build up or a glacier biome. If you want a custom experience, play on creative mode and build your own mountains like you've always wanted. But there is one more thing I want to talk about. This a great game, and you can even climb ice, but the creator has recently said some anti-lgbt things. I don't really understand that (although I don't understand straight relationships either, I only really understand climbing ice, but I guess I haven't met the right girl) and I found it distracting during my climbing. But that isn't the point at all. I also like the music (mostly just pig step) but it's unfortunate I can't carry the note block up the mountain while I climb.

metacritic,Hannashelt,minecraft,"Minecraft is a multi platform video game that incorporates fantasy aspects to a 3-D world made up of cubes. When I first started playing Minecraft, I was only a young child. The game contained aspects that allowed my creativity to flourish making this game easily become one of my favorites. You can play the game in creative or survival or even on PC with hard-core mode. Creative is always my favorite because it allows you to build some of the coolest things imaginable. Everyone plays differently, but I found that I prefer to just mess around. There is a way to win, but I’ve never really had much interest in winning the game. This little essay will cover some of the more basic points of Minecraft like the types of survival players as well as a little tidbit at the end about the new updates announced by Minecraft Live 2024. The game was first released as “Cave Game” back in 2009 and recently experienced its 15th anniversary in May of this year. The full version of the game was released in 2011 dubbed Minecraft. The game was created by a developer named Markus Persson also known as “Notch”. Notch left the company Mojang (the company that published Minecraft) shortly after its first full release. Leaving the future of the game in Mojang’s control. Since its release, Minecraft has had updates nearly every year with the most recent being the trial update with many more plans in the future. Mojang has been announcing these updates with an event called Minecraft Live. Initially called Minecon from 2011 to 2019 and held in person till 2016, Minecraft live is a live stream where Mojang announces its plans for the game for the coming year.Minecraft is one of the most accessible video games that I can think of in terms of today’s online games. Being multi-platform the game is available on PC, mobile, and console with 2 types; Java for PC and Bedrock for the rest. Some believe there is a bit of a bias toward the Java version because there is a lot more stuff available with mods and shaders as well as being the original version. Bedrock can also have custom mods but it can be more expensive. People also tend to think that Bedrock is easier than Java due to different controls as well as different coding in general. All in all Java definitely has more of the hardcore players while Bedrock being available on more devices is more popular among casual gamers (not saying there aren’t hardcore gamers on Bedrock). While Minecraft is initially a single player game, servers can be opened up to allow you to play with friends leading to the ever popular content genre of SMPs. Minecraft content creators have been around since the creation of the game but with servers these creators can play together to make content. There are private servers with a whitelist allowing who comes in like the Lifesteal SMP and there are also public servers that anyone can play on like Hypixel. Overall these servers have allowed different types of players to interact and i've noticed 3 main kinds of survival players; the PVPer who is really good at killing mobs and other players, the builder who can build the most majestic bases/statues ever, lastly the collector the person who somehow has everything the game has to offer. It's really cool to see these different types of players together in one world. Obviously no one is completely one or the other and there are probably several players who are a mix. This was just an observation I have made over the years of watching SMPs online.I’d recommend Minecraft to pretty much anyone who was interested because there are so many ways to play. Obviously modes like survival or hardcore might not be getting my highest recommendation for younger audiences mainly due to the fact that the mobs can be scary, but modes like creative make it so the mobs have no interest in you and it helps foster one's creativity. Overall Minecraft is a game for everyone from hardcore gamers to people just wanting an open world to build some crazy cool bases. Now onto what has been happening today with Minecraft. Minecraft Live 2024 was live today and released some interesting future updates for Vanilla Minecraft such as Hardcore mode and Bundles coming to the Bedrock version (Yay for Bedrock gamers).

metacritic,audaki,minecraft,"Minecraft is just an amazing game. I found really late to this game, but I still loved every minute of it. Redstone is amazing if you are a programmer. The exploring part will easily give you at least 100 hours of enjoyment if you are new to the game.

metacritic,Kheiku,minecraft,"O que dizer do Minecraft? Um jogo que marcou a minha vida.

Viciante! Você se deparar com um mundo vasto, com várias criaturas e lugares para explorar. Que te deixa com uma curiosidade imensa de saber o que há mais a frente esse mundo misterioso e vasto.
O fato de você poder obter texturas e mods com certa facilidade, tornam o jogo ainda mais criativo e com várias possibilidades diferentes. Onde você pode criar o seu jogo dentro do jogo.
O modo multiplayer ajuda para isso também. Você interagir, criar e explorar junto com seus amigos, tornam esse jogo muito mais imersivo.

Um mundo gigantesco, com muitas possibilidades diferentes. Onde sua imaginação é o limite. Você pode criar o seu mundo ideal e com diversos desafios, solo ou com amigos.

Acredito que o mais marcante desse game é os infinitos mods que a comunidade cria, um mais incrível que o outro. Principalmente quando isso envolve o modo multiplayer.

Não consigo pensar em um defeito nesse game. É uma infinita possibilidade de coisas que você pode fazer, que nunca enjoa. Foi marcante de mais para minha vida. Jogo desde criança e sempre é bom.

You also get to choose which instalment you want on PC, between Bedrock and Java edition, each having different qualities and differences, alongside selectable servers and features.

The theme and charm of Animal Crossing expressed as an Adventure game: 
-it has the best gliding in any game ever
-an excellent LAYERED soundtrack
-fantastic storytelling for the level of a basic premise (AAA devs TAKE NOTE)
-down-to-earth (often funny) dialogue from a cozy cast of NPCs
-lush visuals.

A top-down, open world, non-linear Platformer Adventure game- an introspective journey away from city life to find oneself indulging nature amidst looming teenage angst and family turmoil. 
Claire must explore to earn Golden Feathers and further increase her climbing stamina (and glide time) to ascend a conflicting mountain peak at the heart of the game's richly-spoiled, forest-laden world.

Aside from the backend of the map being an unworkable cliff-face, the game is otherwise utterly flawless. One of the best games ever made, easily.

The game is around 4 hours long, 6 to 100% completion. As long as it needs to be, and short enough to ingrain itself in your brain for years. Always leave the audience wanting more and never outstay your welcome. A f* Masterpiece of fun.",10,10

The first time I played A Short Hike, I made my way straight the final goal quickly.  I finished it in about an hour. I thought the game was okay, but nothing special.  I tried playing it a second time a few weeks ago, and I finished it with a much more positive opinion.  This time, I took my time to explore the island, get to know characters, and finish the side quests.  I was surprised at how many little things densely populated the small island. I'm still not sure if I found them all. Experiencing a lot of the adventures on the island will add to the ending of the game.  My suggestion is to take your time with this one in order to get the most out of it.",9,10

metacritic,NindieSpotlight,a-short-hike,"We’ve truly been blessed over the past 6 months or so with a strong run of generally bite-sized exploratory adventures that focus far more on the wonder of nature and discovery than the normal more action-oriented fare typically out there. A Short Hike, though only lasting a few hours, seems to have that perfect ratio to keep everything tight and satisfying, never having to wander too far before you see something to be found, someone to interact with, or a hint at something you may be able to discover later with the right equipment. Moving around the scenic park you’ll encounter a variety of people, some there to help you and some in need of some quick help which typically won’t have you tromping around to find what they’re looking for. It may not have loads of depth or character development but honestly you’re likely to be so enchanted with the beauty of your surroundings and the clean simplicity of the overall experience that it won’t matter a bit. A definite recommendation for people looking to relax or younger gamers with parents trying to find them something appropriate for just about any skill level.

metacritic,GamePat-net,a-short-hike,"A Short Hike is a charming short story with a surprisingly lot to do. The visuals took some getting used to for me but especially in handheld mode on the Nintendo Switch that went rather quickly.

The endearing story really fits in the small and lively open world. The developer created the right setting with the choice of colors and audio. The controls are very smooth, making it a joy to traverse the world by foot, wings or boat.

The camera can play some tricks on you sometimes, but it certainly isn't game breaking. Also, the story is sweet, but in my opinion a little too short and, maybe due to this, not very memorable.

Join me on this short review of A Short Hike.

The feature most apparent as you load up the game for the first time is the visuals. Pixels are jagged, giving it an appearance of something you might see in the mid 90’s. I thought that it added charm, and it was clear that a creative choice was made here. Perhaps not everybody will feel the same, but fear not, because it is possible to adjust the visuals in the settings menu. After my eyes could not take much more of the large and chunky pixels, I switched it over to the sharpest image quality, and I was astonished by what a difference this made in my overall enjoyment. The game looks stunning with the more refined graphics, and I find it hard to believe that this was developed by just one person.

As you start your journey on this small island, you are treated with a cutscene of sorts. It appears that there is someone driving you, Claire, to a summer camping trip, and then you are thrown into the game with little else to go on. As you take your first steps out of the cabin, you discover that your phone has no reception at the base of the island. You are then tasked with scaling the steep mountainside to make a phone call. Along the way, you will meet some colorful characters and have some amusing conversations, none of which are mandatory. This is one of those experiential titles, where you can play it however you would like. If you want to cut all the side missions and just ascend to the top in one quick swoop, you can. I do not recommend playing it that way though. The richness of the extra content you will stumble upon along the way can only be fully appreciated if you stop and smell the roses. Take this game at your own pace and be pleasantly surprised by what it has to offer.

The music in this game is so relaxing. Actually, everything about A Short Hike is relaxing, but the music stands out in this department. I will link you to one song out of the soundtrack that gives me happy, care-free vibes. You can listen to it here on YouTube. The acoustic strings, the light bongos, and the piano melodies make this one of my all-time favorite soundtracks of any game. It is music that makes you feel, and this game really does evoke some strong emotions.

While creative liberties shaped this game into an emotional ride, the gameplay holds up as well. The most appealing mechanic in the game would have to be the flying, or more appropriately, gliding. By holding the A button, you can float ever so gently, slowly losing altitude for every second that passes in the air. It is really satisfying to jump off a ledge and float to another ledge off in the distance. By pressing A as you glide, you can use a golden feather to flap your wings and fly, elongating your hang-time. You can also climb which will be crucial in making it to the peak of the mountain. While flying is by far the more appealing option, climbing will burn through golden feathers a lot slower than the simple flap of your wings, making it the more practical method.

It is hard to judge the replay value A Short Hike has. It will differ from person to person. I am inclined to play it again, maybe in a year or two, so the experience is not fresh in my mind. It is one of those games that almost makes me wish I could play it again for the first time. The game is incredibly short, spanning only a couple hours maximum. In those two hours, I felt this was an adventure well worth the price of entry, but you may not share this sentiment. For those who are looking for a lot of bang for your buck, you may want to look elsewhere. If you are looking for something short and fun to get emotionally invested in, this is that game. I believe this game is a masterpiece, but I am also aware that it may not jive with everyone. If you thought everything outlined in this review is something you would enjoy, then I would highly recommend you jump on this one. I certainly did not regret it, and I am hopeful that neither will you.",9,10

It's basically you climbing up a mountain, and then finding and earning feathers so that you can fly around, and flying is crucial for reaching the very top of the mountain.

Initially the graphics are really bad, but you can fix it in the settings. Some people may like the weird, low rez graphics. I've already played through twice, and I'll probably play through it again a time or two.",10,10

metacritic,96bellamy,a-short-hike,"Estamos ante un juego cortito y poco pretencioso pero que lo que quiere hacer lo hace bien no, fenomenal. Se trata de un juego extremadamente agradable tanto en lo jugable como en lo visual y en lo sonoro, y que se basa principalmente en 3 pilares. Por un lado tenemos la ''misión principal'' que consiste en escalar el pico de la isla en la que nos encontramos, para lo cual el juego hace uso de unas mecánicas basadas en escalada y vuelo y limitadas por estamina extremadamente satisfactorias. En segundo lugar tenemos el factor exploración, la cual es muy amena gracias a la ligereza del gameplay, y recompensa constantemente, aparte de encontrarnos ante una preciosa isla, no muy grande pero llena de cosas. Y por último debo hablar de las relaciones con los demás habitantes de la isla, las cuales son sobresalientes y están cargadas de un humor y una personalidad desbordantes. Este título bebe de Animal Crossing en este aspecto, llevando esa fórmula de sociabilización a una escala mucho más comedida, guiada (los diálogos tienen una serie de fases y de ahí no salen), y bajo mi punto de vista tremendamente efectiva y graciosa (te vas a reir bastante por las locas situaciones que encontrarás en Pico Halcón, nombre de la isla).

En definitiva estamos ante un título al que no se le puede poner un solo pero, todo lo que hace lo hace realmente bien y deja una sensación muy plena tras ser jugado. Como único punto negativo podría mencionarse su escasa duración, ya que la misión principal puede completarse a ritmo normal en 2h o menos incluso ( luego hay modo speedrun incluido en el juego y he visto a gente completar el juego en 1 minuto xD), y completar el 100% nos llevará algo más de 5h (bajo mi punto de vista aquí es donde está la chicha del juego, sobre todo en desarrollar las ''misiones secundarias'' que nos proponen los habitantes de la isla). Pero partiendo de su reducido precio no creo que corresponda bajar del 10 redondo a este auténtico juegazo, el cual puede ser tuyo por 6 euritos de nah.",10,10
metacritic,Gontrand00,a-short-hike,"Amazing game. Simple, cute, so efficient with the hiking-relaxing-holiday mood. I had to stop myself from completing it in one run since I had so much fun exploring this island.

It's that kind of rare game where you wish it was bigger and longer (that's what she said).

Also, it really gave me the impression of playing through an Miyazaki movie (not for the art style but for the impression it gives you and for the characters).

One of the best 2020 game out there, and for 10$ it's such a bargain. Even if it takes like 6-7h max to complete it, every minute spent in this game is worth it, and that's really rare.

GIVE US MORE PLEASE.",10,10
metacritic,CoolestCritic,a-short-hike,"The game's pixel graphics really add to the game, creating a 3D experience that I could never recreate.

I would recommend this to ALL my friends.",10,10

metacritic,SuperkenGaming,a-short-hike,"A Short Hike
Short But sweet
A Short Hike is a tiny adventure game where you play as Clair, a bird that sets out to reach the top of Hawks Peak so that she can make a phone call to her mom… as the name suggests short hike can be quite the short game, you can easily beat thi game in less than an hr and a half.. but a short hike isn’t about beating it, its about experiencing its world…
A short hike is so full of charm and things to do, from collecting shells, finding secrets treasures, obtaining new items..fishing.. finding lost items… all to do one thing.. obtain more golden feathers o you can climb and fly your way to the top of the mountain, and I loved every minute of it…
hile its visuals aren’t the best, they will grow on you… If youre into adventure games, where the goal is to just explore and take in the view, I highly recommend a short hike
I give A Short Hike
a 7.5/10",8,10
metacritic,Kacek1996,a-short-hike,"I've got pretty late on a ""A Short Hike"" hype train, but I'm here! It's an indie adventure game that may seem like nothing special, but in reality it's different. Starting from graphics, it has a low resolution, but it gives an option to choose between smooth edges and chunky pixelated ones (I chose the smooth ones xD). Exploration in this game is what makes it truly great. In every part of the island camera is set in a way so the player cannot take a peek at some stuff. It makes the exploration experience more intriguing. There are some quests to do, but mostly it's the pure exploration. Obviously, you can rush to the peak of the island to finish the game. However, I cannot relate to people who rush games xd
It's a short game even without the rush, I think it took me 4 or 5 hours to finish it at 100%. To be honest, I collected my last 2 golden and 2 silver feathers after reaching the peak of the mountain... Soundtrack was comfortable, visuals were vibrant and colorful, controls were easy to understand and the overall experience was satisfying. I really adore the aspect of climbing as well as gliding in the exploration games and here both of these mechanics were phenomenal. Short and Sweet, comfy game for a one sitting!",8,10
metacritic,parikuma,a-short-hike,"The style is peaceful and beautiful, the game is really to be enjoyed at your own pace.
It's a short game but that's the point (it's even in the title!).

Little games and quests on your way to the top are really fun, and the game really makes you want to chat with everybody and help out.
""Completing"" the game feels really like you finished a beautiful hike.

Props to the (only!) dev and his great work. I played it on the mac and my partner played it on the switch, and I have no problem giving this guy money twice honestly, and hoping he'll make more games!",10,10

metacritic,nusco,a-short-hike,"Many games sell themselves as ""chilled"" or ""relaxing"", but A Short Hike is the game that I wish I could play again and again when I'm looking to ease my mind. Unfortunately, it doesn't lend itself to repeated play–and like its name says, it's extremely short. I'm a very slow player, but even I could see the ending of this game in about two hours.

That short playtime, however, is not a shortcoming. On the contrary, this game is made even better by its limited length. For those two hours, A Short Hike tells a heartwarming little story, set in a nice miniature open world, full of paths to explore and side quests to complete. None of those side quests feels boring–you won't see any pointless collect-a-thons in this game. Everything has a place, and contributes to make A Short Hike a beautiful, if quick, escapade.",8,10

metacritic,Guishu,shovel-knight,"Let me address this before anything: My thought process for my reviews are obviously personal BUT I do take into account a lot of objective factors (Not other people's reviews though.) Just keep that in mind so you can understand why I couldn't give this game a perfect 10.
Shovel Knight is my favorite platformer in the last 5 years. I don't think any other game comes close. However it is also true this game is just what I expect from my perfect platformer. So my perfect score turns into a almost perfect score when I take into account some factors. Rogue-likes and RPGs go very well together. Adding platforming to the mix is not an easy task. I really want to know how in the world Yacht Club Games made it look as easy as counting to three.
Amazing art, Inspired enemies and levels, cool bosses and some over world goodies? Yes please. Shovel Knight does it all, and it does it great. I love this game and I love the creators for making it. I expect big things from them know, so I'll guess we will see.
Shovel knight suffers from one thing though: It is not that original. It may seem like it, but I wish I had seen at least one mechanic that I would have never seen coming. That would make it a 10 out of 10 review worthy game. A 9 is still a must play with me.",9,10
metacritic,aditya1101,shovel-knight,"A lot of great retro platformers have popped up recently, but few have felt as great to play as shovel knight. This game perfectly captures the ability of retro platformers to have fairly simple core mechanics but to scale immensely in difficulty. This is a game where every level felt super fun to play through over and over again until I had mastered it. Also, it has an incredible soundtrack :D",10,10
metacritic,B-Knock,shovel-knight,"Overrated and extremely boring to play. The game play is not addictive and truly nothing special. If you want to play retro games. Pick up a real NES or just buy the NES classic. You can even emulate old NES games. Shovel knight is just a rehash of Duck tales and Mega Man with a new original story. However nothing is new about the game mechanics or style of the game. This game received so much fan fare and high ratings because of this whole retro gaming trend that is currently going on. Developers are taking advantage of this fact and allows them to release low quality games like this, and make a quick buck off retro nostalgia.",7,10
metacritic,hypernewbie,shovel-knight,"Anyone who reviews this game 10 should immediately go get an actual NES and play actual good oldschool games.

The shovel knight just feels like **** to control, very clunkey, especially mid-air. The stairs just make no sense in this game, at all. You will die on nearly every staircase in the game.

Level cycles are too random to be memorized. Enemies are RNG galore and always feel like they move faster than you giving you no time to react, UNLESS you wait for them. There aren't enough checkpoints.

Should I mention the **** feel of the control again? Shovel knight controls like a rock. Just go outside, pick up a really big rock and move that around, and you will get the general feel of moving shovel knight through the levels.

Game isn't bad, it's okay. The presentation is the best part of it, oldschool gfx are well done, especially the animations, they are amazing. Music is great too. They got so carried away with the presentation that they forgot to like, actually make the game.",4,10
metacritic,everin,shovel-knight,"TIER 2

+ Obviously pays strong respects to that which inspired it, but comes out on top as feeling more polished, dense, and masterfully executed than many retro games.
+ A very good mixture of level mechanics and themes, and while the player has limited mobility and attacks, the levels provide new tools and experiences time and time again.
? The spell system is interesting in providing a variety of new tools, but ultimately feels like mixed bag random additional mechanics that reduce the tight execution of the title.
? The tedium of some of the boss fights makes it too easy to be tempted into using the invincibility mechanics on offer to cheese combat.
- The base movement and combat systems, while true to retro games, often don't feel good to use. The lack of directional attacks make many of the enemies nothing but annoying unless you happen to click with what's on offer.",7,10

metacritic,Captain_Chaos,shovel-knight,"Rarely have I so enjoyed a game that so persistently made me rage, or made me care for an 8-bit sprite as much as I cared for Shield Knight, but Shovel Knight is just that game. An affectionate homage to the golden age of console gaming, Shovel Knight comes to us from former members of Wayforward Technologies, creators of the Shantae series. The game's incredibly varied stages play out like a greatest hits album of classic platformers. But unlike, say, Ninja Gaiden or Castlevania, Shovel Knight never feels cheap or punishing. The game is filled with a lovable cast of characters, excellent music (courtesy of the ineffable Virt Kaufman, the musical genius behind Contra 4, Scurge: Hive, Shantae, and several other games), useful powerups and hair-pulling jumping puzzles. The controls are extremely tight, and any mistakes you make are your own damn fault. The game rather mercifully makes use of checkpoints, only depriving you of money when you die, money you have a chance to retrieve when you make it back to where you died. And even if you don't, you can always farm for more, and you will need quite a bit to buy all the upgrades. I had to take a few breaks over the course of playing Shovel Knight to cool off, but I kept coming back until I was done. I do not regret for a second backing this lovely game on kickstarter.

metacritic,zamapa,shovel-knight,"I have never owned an NES, I have never played an NES game yet I still love this game. It has solid controls and teaches through game-play instead of text. You constantly obtain new abilities in the game, and encounter new enemies and objects. The level design is extremely clever, teaching you something in a low stress situation, and later adding pressure to test you on what you've learned.

The graphics and music and charming, and I think they're great even though I have no nostalgia for them. The story is simple and skip able, I couldn't ask for much more. The game become's very challenging, and even though it teaches the mechanics of levels well before you encounter them in a deadly situation, you can still die in some cheap ways. The game is full of adorable characters, and it never felt like it was wasting my time. If I didn't want to talk to a character I usually didn't have to, and if I did I could skip their dialogue if I wanted.

This is one of my favorite platformers mostly because of the amazing level design. There is so much polish on every detail of this game and it's noticeable. It's fun, and even though the gameplay can be unforgiving checkpoints are frequent and give you some breathing room. This entire game is an example **** tutorial.",10,10
metacritic,Molvanian,shovel-knight,"This game is old school Nintendo, at its best AND its worst. The problem is, no one makes games like this anymore for a reason.

There's a lot of good to the game, the mechanics are interesting, the feel is very nostalgic, the sound track is amazing.

...The gameplay is not. It's frustrating, it's repetitive. It isn't 'hard'. Anyone can beat Shovel Knight. Anyone can walk through barbed wire. The experiences are very similar. Endure the pain long enough and eventually you win. At the end, you're unsatisfied. And bleeding.

It boggles my mind the game is so well reviewed. I can only assume it's pure, unadulterated nostalgia blinding people to, what if viewed on it's own, would be a very average, flawed game, and this is coming from someone who owned an NES when it was new.

The controls are spot-on, the gameplay is retro yet modern (check points, automatic saving) and similar things go for the visuals (it's 8 bit style but animations usually weren't as refined back then and the color palette not as varied).

On top of all of this, the graphics and music are straight out of the NES era – many games try to nail this down but only a select few get it right.

A charming, hilarious, and challenging adventure worth adding to your library.",9,10

metacritic,pwp20,shovel-knight,"Overall impression: An excellent ode to the retro era. A must play for anyone who grew up with late 80s/ early 90s video games.

metacritic,albanshqiptar,shovel-knight,This game has the best level design i have ever seen. The music is so good it is worth to download the soundtrack and the 8 bit gaming features are on point.

metacritic,Robobob,shovel-knight,"Shovel Knight is an ok game that harkens back to the old school 8-bit games.  There are some fun levels though I noticed they are mostly very short with some difficult platforming to take up your time.  The music is good but repetitive (like the old school games) so I muted it after the first level.  I noticed the keyboard controls are not very intuitive and responsive for platforming type games.. I wish I had a controller for my PC to see if it was easier to play, but my hands felt cramped and crowded by the AWSD keys and I wish there was a better way to traverse the menus and use your special power... which required hitting 2 keys which I would not time correctly very often.  I played with the key setup constantly but didn't find one that I would like.  All-in-all I found some levels to be extremely difficult though but the boss battles were easy.  One level I just couldn't get through so I quit altogether,  It was a fun few hours until it got too frustrating.",5,10
metacritic,Makaveli,shovel-knight,"This game reminds me alot of Megaman, only with Megaman you had to defeat robot masters, with Shovel Knight you defeat different types of knights. Which Megaman you have Doctor Wilys castle and in this you have the same thing but not with Wily..

It's a good game, it's not perfect but it really took  me back to the days of the NES.

metacritic,AVdE,shovel-knight,"Shovel Knight is a great game, both for gamers attracted by the '80s nostalgia, and for people who want a taste of what made '80s games so great. The difficulty is just right: very challenging ('80s style), but not offputtingly frustrating. The art style of this game is top notch, and the Mega Man-ish music just really hypes you up for the level. Seriously, the 8-bit styled atmosphere and music shows off real love towards all the classics this game was inspired by. And if you play with a controller, the controls are excellent. Level design is fantastic, boss battles are great, there are lots of collectibles in hidden areas. Also, the destroy-the-checkpoints-and-get-goodies-idea is genius.

All that being said, the game might be a little bit over-hyped. Don't get me wrong, I had a blast playing it, but I don't think I enjoyed it as much as some other people did.

Nevertheless, this is a really original and fun game you absolutely need to have in your library. 8.5/10",9,10

A must Play For all
Shovel Knight is a beautifully charming action platforming game.
Shovel Knights art style screams nostalgia sale, but I was happy  to find that this game isn’t just here to pull money out of your pockets with heart strings, Shovel Knight is it’s own game, an instant classic.
Shovel knight consists of 12 main levels all with their own boss battles, each level and stage getting progressively more challenging.
The pacing is really some of the best ive ever seen in gaming.
Every level has checkpoints, this may annoy the hardcore gamers at first, but you really come to appreciate them, platforming can get really trick for those of us that are impatient.
These type of gamers are who the checkpoints are for, they are essentially training wheels.
Shovel Knight is really more than just a flat forming game, it truly is an experience, and im happy these checkpoints exist so all can experience and guess what… checkpoints are COMPLETELY optional.
Don’t like them?
Break them, they drop cash so now you have nothing to complain about.
I wouldn’t recommend doing such a thing your first time through as again, shovel knight gets increasingly challenging.
Enemies will start throwing projectiles, youll have to dodge lava and spikes and look out for enemies while you seek out secrets.
There are tons of secrets to be found in shovel knight that I wont spoil, but they add such a great deal of wonder to the game, you never know what youre going to find in a room you just uncovered from an exploding rat.
It could be a music page for you to sell in the villiage, or a new relic waiting for you to grab to help you out through the rest of the game.
I wasn’t expecting relics, but im so happy they exist, these relics all cost magic to use so cant really be spammed, but they are all varied and make you look at levels for better, more efficient ways to traverse them.
You can also save your gold for armour and shovel upgrades, maybe increased magic or meal tickets to increase your health, the choice is yours, but unless youre completely confident in your skills walking into an unknown area you better make that choice before going back out, because every time you die you drop 3 pouches of gold much like in the souls series.
If you want that gold back youre going to have to go grab it, if you die on your way back then its gone forever..
The risk reward makes traversing these gorgeous levels even more enjoyable.
Not only did this development team due a great job with level design and enemies, but also with bosses.
Each boss has its own attack style, so no 2 relics will be equally handy in these encounters, gratefully though, they all die the same way, hit them an x amount of times.
Games can get in the habit of making bosses a little too unique, what shovel knight does so great is make the encounters similar enough to give you a sense of pride and feeling like you used skill to defeat a new enemy rather than you just got completely lucky.
It isn’t common to die during your first encounter with a new boss and that is so refreshing.
I wont get into story all too much, but I will say that it is there, there is reason to the madness and it, at least to me is beautiful.
After you’ve completed the game and have picked every level apart for its secrets and treasures, you have the option to start a new game +.
New game plus lets you start from the beginning with everything you collected in your previous play through, but this time levels are a little tougher as youll notice some checkpoints are missing, enemies do double damage, and there are no health pick ups.
There are tons of challenging feats to accomplish in shovel knight.
Totally worth the playthrough just to experience, a highly recommended game title to both casual and hardcore gamers alike.
I truly believe that everyone can find something to love about shovel knight.
For what it is
Action platformer 10/10
and as an overall game my first ever 10/10",10,10
metacritic,Akumala,shovel-knight,"Terribly dated and simple plattformer in NES technique, with a frustratingly high difficulty.
After having tried to like this game for about 20 hours, i cannot recommend this game.",6,10
metacritic,renreview,shovel-knight,"I wanted to love this game, i always enjoyed old games, i bought a lot of them on steam and my 3ds. And i was really excited for this game to come out. But something about shovel night makes me so frustrated every time i play it, except the beginning. It may be that i played it on steam instead of my 3ds and it may be better with an xbox controller, but the games controls well on pc. so thats not a problem, the problem is that it is frustrating it can't be that its to hard, i play dark souls. I think its that some enemies in the game feel cheap like in risen 3, except hear their much easier to kill and can kill you faster, it may not sound that bad but i got so mad at this game that i broke my headphones by ripping the wire. But this game is good, it has great music great platforming  and some amazing things that you can use or buy, i mean use because there are platforms that can kill you but if you're smart and you time it right you can use it to your advantage. if you have one, buy it on your 3ds, if not, i would wait for a sale",7,10
metacritic,Amaerlyn,shovel-knight,"There's no doubt where inspiration came from when making this game and I love it. There isn't much that I want different with this game and that feeling of playing a brand new game that feels like it is part of something old really comes through.

metacritic,edwartexe,shovel-knight,"ITS PERFECT this game is great! from the simple controlers than can be aplied to interact in so many ways with the enviroment and enemies. the level design which is intuitive and fun to travel while creating new challenges and new ways for you to act in them. the boss characters have enough charm and personality to make themselves notable and their fights have great variety. the story seems simple at first but it turns deeper and much more rewarding than initialy expected i wont spoil just gonna tell you its great XD. the 8bit graphics are amazing, colorful and detailed enough to give off all sorts of characters and animations. the upgrades are not about making the character stronger but about giving you new tools for you to traverse the levels without breaking the dificulty. i just wanna say i didnt play the 8bit era of games so i can see that this is not merely nostalgia bait, its a full experience on its own I LOVE THIS GAME",10,10
metacritic,mattia_76,shovel-knight,"I' m giving it an 8, but keep in mind that this game cannot compare with graphics of today. It is a pleasure for old time gamers that look into the past with nostalgia. The game takes the best of games like Super Mario Bros 3, Faxanadu, Zelda 2, Mega Man & others, creating a game that has a unique personality.

metacritic,cyanidhogg,shovel-knight,"This is an absolute gem ****. Shovel Knight is a platformer built on the bones of the very best the NES library has to offer, polished with great modern game design. The graphics are marvellous, the controls are tight and the level design fantastically designed. The true highlight of the game, though, has to be the soundtrack, which is one of the best video game soundtracks we've seen in years. Don't miss this one.",9,10
metacritic,MGTE,shovel-knight,"In the last couple of years the obsession with old school games has led many developers to develop their own 8/16bit games. This attitude has flooded the market with mediocre 2D ”old-school” platformers and instantly became the ”go to” genre for most Indie developers, spawning hundreds of failed Kickstarter projects and all of that is not a case when it comes to Yacht Club Games, they’ve raised $311,502 and released their first game, Shovel Knight. The game delivers a visually appealing 8-bit aesthetic, an amazing soundtrack and smooth animations.

Let’s talk about the story. The game opens up with the ”cutscene” showing the game’s protagonist, Shovel Knight and his partner Shield Knight, you can clearly tell that the devs put a lot of thought into the characters’ names. Following a tragedy, Shield Knight is taken away from Shovel Knight by The Enchantress and her army, the Order of no Quarter…I’m not making that up. The Order consists of eight knights, each of them is originally named, for ex. Mole Knight, Plauge Knight or The Black Knight…yeah.  Back to the story, you grab your shovel…yes, a shovel and go off on an epic adventure to defeat The Enchantress.
One of the things I love about Shovel Knight is how it teaches you how to play it without spamming the text boxes with ”TO JUMP PRESS THE A BUTTON” and things like that. The first few stages teach you everything you need to know without saying anything, this is great, it made me want to play the game even more.

The stages play like in a Mega Man game, the monsters are not your only enemies in the game, the environments can get involved in the action too, for ex. the lightning effects occasionaly light up making moving from platform to platform that much more difficult, it got kind of frustrating but it was interesting. The combat is extremely basic, but satisfying, just like in the 8bit era–had to download an NES emulator to realize that.  You have your basic ”shovel slash” but you can also do sort of a Duck Tales attack by leaping on top of your enemies. You can also use your shovel to epically dig out a treasure from the ground. Shovel is not your only weapon, throughout the game you come across other weapons that allow you to attack from afar aka fire wand.

I really liked that the devs included the checkpoint system so that you don’t have to start from the start when you die, I’m glad that you guys did not go hardcore mode with your old-school roots. You also have an option to destroy a checkpoint for some loot, I have never done that but If you enjoy challenge then sure, go for it. The treasures you’ve collected throughout the game allow you to purchase certain things like health/mana upgrades. After each stage you are transported to a world map that allows you to access different levels, in order to advance to a next area you first have to beat one of the previously mentioned, originally named Knights.

Each stage presents new challenges that make the game more difficult the further you advance. They each have a unique theme and sometimes, new enemies that act differently and force different approaches, it makes for a very enjoyable gameplay experience. Same goes for the platforming, it gets more and more challenging as you play.

I need to touch on one more thing that in my opinion, might be the most enjoyable thing about Shovel Knight, the boss fights. Each Knight has a unique fighting style and requires a bit of thinking, you have to figure out a pattern in which they move before attacking. You can’t just spam the attack button, just like in the old days(so I’ve heard) you have to think before approaching. I can safely say that this game offered me the most enjoyable boss fights I’ve ever experienced. Big round of applause for that.

Lastly, I would like to talk about the difficulty of the game. I’ve had two weeks to write and publish this review but instead it took me three. I really did not think that the game would be that difficult, I thought that I’d be able to swoosh through the game in a couple of days but no, that was certainly not the case. It might be because I did not grew up in the 80s, and I did not fully experience the true ”holy-f*cking ****, this is hard” era so, It might be easier for you old people out there but nonetheless I’ve had a ton of fun and I certainly will re-play it again, this time with cheat codes. (there are over 300 of them in the game).",8,10
metacritic,DailySparta,shovel-knight,"Okay, giant disclaimer: I DID NOT GROW UP WITH ANY RETRO PLATFORMERS!
But even that didn't stop this game from being amazing.

Shovel Knight is an amazing game which really mixes platforming with combat well. It is VERY similar to Mega Man, and those games are great. It took everything that was great about Mega Man games, and polishes them and improves them. Dying means your money flies away, but you can get it back! Meaning if you're good, an occasional death is literally inconsequential. Its graphics really leave quite a bit to your imagination, but are detailed enough to be amazing looking! Oh, and the music. Ohhh the music. It's amazing. The bosses have telegraphed moves, but they don't have an order! Boss fights are therefore fun and challenging, and even a little enraging at some points. =D This game is a masterpiece, even without nostalgia goggles making everything look even better. The one point off is just the fact that it feels a bit short, but honestly, that's not much of a problem. Trying to get all those feats will CERTAINLY make you work hard and keep replay ability high.

Pro: Excellent mechanics, fun enemies, tight platforming, heaps of replay ability, and a decent challenge!
Con: A little bit short.",9,10

Anyway, I was a bit sceptical at first when people were recommending this game all over the internet. telling that this game was amazing. $ 15 is not that cheap but I had some money left in my account so  I bought the game and started playing. From the first level until the last one all are really beautiful fun and innovative in there own way. It' felt like the first time I started playing zelda game.  It looks retro but it doesn't feel this way.

metacritic,TitaniumDragon,shovel-knight,"Shovel Knight is a retro 2D platformer game deeply devoted to its aesthetic and its puns. Designed as a pseudo-NES game, it harkens back to a long-ago era in gaming, and the game itself feels as if it fits into the era of Megaman. You are the Shovel Knight, a knight armed with a shovel who must beat his way past 12 stages to confront the Sorceress and rescue Shield Knight.

Story

For being such a simplistic game, there is a clear story to the game – Shovel Knight feels guilty because he could not save Shield Knight, and has recurring dreams of catching her while she is falling. Black Knight stands in between Shovel Knight and his goal, not out of loyalty to the Sorceress, but out of loyalty to Shield Knight. The Knights of No Order stand in the way for their own reasons.
Is there much story here? No. But there is enough of a story – and enough reinforcement of the central theme of the game – that it works, and is a bit more than an excuse plot due to the recurring dream of saving Shield Knight.
The game is also wonderfully full of terrible puns, and there are various townsfolk in a couple towns who can be spoken to and who often have silly dialogue.

Gameplay

The gameplay is very straightforward – Shovel Knight can hit things with his shovel, or use relics (of which there are 10), each of which has some special ability. Later on, Shovel Knight also gains the ability to charge up his shovel attacks to make them more powerful, and to switch which armor he is wearing for some minor bonus, frequently counteracted by some minor penalty.
The game is very much classic platforming, with the ability for shovel knight to attack enemies from the side with his shovel or spring up and down on top of them using his shovel like a pogo stick, occasionally necessary for navigating the levels or accessing secrets. The levels often make use of the fact that the protagonist wields a shovel, forcing them to dig through obstacles, sometimes taking advantage of the fact that the pogo sticking has to be stopped manually, and sometimes making use of the shovel otherwise by having Shovel Knight dig stuff out or dig through walls. There is a surprisingly decent variety of enemies, harkening back to Megaman type games, though some of them are repeated with only minor variations between them.
The relics add an additional complication to gameplay; however, I found that I didn’t end up using most of the relics very often, while the basic fireball attack relic, which granted a cheap ranged attack, and the temporary invincibility relic, were very versatile and useful. The rest were all very situational or just less cost efficient, though there were areas which specifically relied on the special properties of specific relics to navigate, which were interesting.
The levels themselves were reasonably varied, in a way somewhat reminiscent of the Megaman games, where each of the 8 major bosses had a specific world, and there was a prologue stage and 3 end-game stages which combined elements from all the previous stages. In addition to the main stages, there were a number of additional mini-stages which often focused on some specific aspect of the game; the overworld map even had Super Mario Brothers 3-esque enemies pop up and walk around on the world map, encouraging you to go fight them.
The levels also had various secrets hidden around them, and in hiding its secrets the game did quite well – the secrets are not immediately obvious, but if the player knows how to look, they stand out, and again remind me of secrets from the era. In addition to the relics, there are also musical tracks which serve as collectibles in the game, with one hidden in every level.
The bosses themselves were reasonably varied and had a decent variety of abilities, but unfortunately suffered from being rather too easy; only two bosses ever killed me, and both of those were because of environmental hazards in the stage which spelled instant death, rather than the actual boss whittling away my health. They were reasonably interesting to fight, but unfortunately the ease of beating them combined with ready access to relics and a couple items reminiscent of E-Tanks from Megaman (fully restoring both magic and health – you could refill them before every stage, too, and could carry two of them) meant that losing to them was extremely unlikely, making them a bit disappointing in terms of difficulty level.
On the whole, the game does a good job of recalling the 8-bit era, and it feels like a very solid game from that era. It is worth noting that the game also recalls the 8-bit era in terms of length as well – the game is pretty short, likely clocking in at 6-8 hours to complete, if not less, depending on how good you are at it and how much time you spend trying to collect achievements and gather money and search for every secret in the game.",7,10
metacritic,VGMage,shovel-knight,"When I heard about this game, I thought it would be an alt-platformer, using your shovel on like grass and stuff; Little did I know this is one of the most fine-tuned overall games I've played in a while. There isn't a real bad thing about this game. It's like Super Meat Boy in the sense that if you die, it's entirely on you; This is one smooth playing game. It's plot is very intriguing, even though it's not much. Once your motivation is given to you for going through these lands and slaying enemies with your trusty shovel, you don't wanna put it down. It can be very challenging, you will die. A lot. But there's nothing stopping you from trying it right after it's done. The music is insane, one of the best retro-esque chiptune soundtracks I've heard. The level design is top-notch, you can tell this wasn't a level editor type of game, with the same type of platforms in a certain way for a whole area of the map; it's a game that is identifiable as a really well thought-out game. When you finish a level, you feel a real sense of accomplishment of what you've done. This game deserves all the unreal praise it's getting, this game is essentially flawless. Pick it up. I promise, you will not be let down.",10,10
metacritic,Rolento,shovel-knight,"They say there is no such thing as new ""art"", and that what you have to do in order to get new art is take pre-existing ideas, combine them and twist them at your will. In an industry were ""innovative"", ""groundbreaking"", ""brand new"" and procedurally generated ""infinite possibilities"" are thrown at us so easily and so much that it almost causes physical sickness to read them, someone remembers that games should be fun, that games shouldn't just blindly try to be innovative for the sake of it, that creativity comes from restriction just as much fun and awe can come from a pre-constructed level and from venturing in it.

Now for the non pretentious part, this game has mechanics from most thing that are impossible to dislike: Castlevania and Megaman's atmosphere and gameplay combined, the DuckTales NES gem's pogo mechanic, and Dark Souls death penalties, and throws them together bound by a love(?)-driven story about character with a simple yet cool gimmick (every knight is a Something Knight, with Shovel Knight being the main character with a... uh, Shovel). In its simplistic story it even manages to be slightly sentimental and dramatic (Shield Knight's story) and has a couple of neat details that one may not even notice (Being a Cerulean knight with horns wasn't just a random design choice, as you are kind of given hints of character's ""origins"" in the Polar Knight stage).

What can I say? The only way to fail with this premise is to have poor level design or not being polished, and that's not the case either: the game never goes out of its ""NES game with some technological licenses"" self-imposed stylistic boundary and the levels play and feel like they're straight out of a classic, alternating action, puzzle and tense mixes of the two.

One minor complaint: among the things the game takes inspiration from, there's Super Mario Bros. 3's level selection and roaming enemies, but overall it only gives the illusion of non-linearity and it's pretty much a superfluous thing that doesn't really give you much options other than choosing what boss to beat first.",9,10

Just play the first level of the game or even the demo and you'll see what I mean. In an era of mostly AAA publisher **** where corporations think we're too stupid to see through their crappy games, Shovel Knight rises among the indie genre and is well worth your $15. The only downside to SK is that it's very short, but only at the moment. The Yacht Club is adding updates every so often once they create the additional content of Kickstarter Goals that were all met, such as playing as Shield Knight instead of Shovel Knight, 3 playable boss characters, a VS mode, a Challenge Mode (similar to the New SMB U version or something akin to NES Remix) and a whole lot of other stuff!

It's perfect in every way; the pin-point controls, the awesome soundtrack, the endearing characters, the quirky humor, the exquisite level design, the balanced difficulty and the emotional gut-punch of the ending. Shovel Knight is brilliant beyond all comprehension. If you ever wanted a modern 2D platformer to catch the true essence of the all-time classics then you can't afford to miss this game.

metacritic,ChuangTzu,shovel-knight,"If you loved 80s platform games such as Megaman or Duck Tales, then you have to try this.
Shovel knight is a brilliant revival of the genre in crisp full HD, with inspiration also from the first Zeldas (the inventory and the cities) and several others of the best 8-bit games.",8,10
metacritic,FantasicGamer,shovel-knight,[SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.],10,10
metacritic,Johangir,shovel-knight,"This is an incredible game that respects and recreates the fundamentals of gaming's roots. It draws its aspirations from Zelda 2, Megaman, Mario 3, and Ducktales, but has so many creative concepts to form its own identity.

The environments and characters have so much detail and personality to them, it's suprising and fresh to see that level of detail in an NES 8-bit styled game. Mostly because it treats its genre (8-bit retro game) with the utmost respect and seriousness. There's no stupid gimmicks or references or winks to remind the player they're playing an 8-bit NES style game: the style is used to deliver a genuine oldschool experience with a straight face and the best of intentions.

The music is amazing, catchy, and fits each theme very well. Jake Kaufman is a brilliant composer and his experience truly shines here, as it has when creating/remixing music for other games he's worked on (Contra 4, Ducktales Remastered, Shantae, etc).

The challenge has the perfect gradual shift throughout the entire game. It starts off normal enough, then consistently increases in challenge until the very end. While you can improve Shovel Knight with new upgrades and abilities, as the player you will feel your own skill increase as you become familiar with how Shovel Knight handles ingame and learn to use him and his abilities much more efficiently. It's a magical learning curve that I haven't experienced since having played games from the golden age when I was a kid back in the 90's.

Regardless of what console you purchase this on, it is a fantastic game in its own right, and provides an incredibly genuine experience and challenge that so many games are lacking nowadays. Perfect 10 out of 10.",10,10
metacritic,dnlhern,shovel-knight,"Shovel Knight is like cookies baked by your grandma. Sure, you could go out to the store and buy those cookies that come in packs, but nothing beats the taste of one's made with ingredients right off the shelf. It may not be the perfect game, but looking past the flaws, you are in for a treat. No, more like a feast.",9,10
metacritic,Dhulfiqar,shovel-knight,"This game have so many reference from old games that it does not bring much original content even in the platforming. Why do you need always copy the concepts of the old games? Why can't you create your own concepts making the game look as much original and reducing the feeling of ""having played this before many times"".

Graphics and animations are good, but sometimes you feel that some of the enemy sprite does not even belong to the game environment. Controllers and it's physics needs to be upgraded, this is where most of the indies makes the same mistakes. The upgrade of health, armor and weapon is not interesting. The level design mostly is very good, but sometimes annoying. Sometimes the levels feels too long, making you thank the old mega man levels length.

Music, very good, there are tracks that should added to best of video game music archive, but there are also  song that sound very bizarre.",7,10
metacritic,jerry5278,shovel-knight,"I really enjoyed shovel knight from beginning to end. Everything about this game blew me away.  I just beat it, and am now playing through it again with new game +.  This is not a game to be missed!!!!!  10/10",10,10
metacritic,ComradePB,shovel-knight,"There are many games out there that go for that retro aesthetic, so you might wonder what exactly it is that sets Shovel Knight apart from all those games that borrow from what has come before them. The creators of Shovel Knight are obviously fans of classic games on the NES like Mario Bros., Megaman, and Castlevania just to name a few and great care has been taken to use the more memorable elements from these games both the loved (Duck Tales style pogo attacks, Megaman style bosses, and Castlevania style sub weapons) and the hated (knock-back deaths and difficulty on the level of Megaman 2). Even so, Shovel Knight does enough to set itself apart as it's own game with it's quirky cast of characters, awesome music, amazing sprite art, and rather odd choice of weaponry. It is not perfect however; even though I would consider Shovel Knight a fair game, there were times where I felt that no person playing for their first time would be able to avoid death just because an enemy popped up over a bottomless pit when they weren't expecting it. A death in a video game is fair when the player sees danger coming and simply doesn't respond to it accordingly, it's not fair if you get **** punched. Even so this only emboldens that classic NES feeling where a gamer will play again but this time with memory on their side. Shovel Knight is a game that is well worth your time.",8,10
metacritic,Nile3,shovel-knight,"The graphs are amazing, more realistic than Crysis 3 imo and the story is so good that it feels more realistic than CNN news can be.

Great Game! I loved it. I encountered a bug early on where I couldn't load the game, but right after everything went smoothly.
I have 2 smallish problems with it:
1. it's too short. I want more. I'm already through with it.
2. Shovel knight ought to have an epic quest to find a different shovel or get more tricks!
Otherwise it was great.",9,10
metacritic,ninesthousand,shovel-knight,"Shovel Knight is as close to a perfect game in the style of oldschool NES platformers. Everything about it is perfect for what it does.

metacritic,SaLDjouN,shovel-knight,"This game is so awesome it's a mix of the best things you can find in megaman, duck tales, zelda (2 especially ) and smb 3 mixed with some modern thing like the dark souls style death. in one word : this games is really great",10,10
metacritic,wingnut5k,shovel-knight,"Now, I did not grow up with consoles, so I have no nostalgia except from what I played from the ambassador program and virtual console. But this is a masterpiece, with the only issue being some mechanics are infuriating. The combat is tight, the game has charm, a plethora of content, and loot a plenty. The game can be brutally hard (paying homage to the titles its based on), but make beating a particularly hard boss that much more satisfying.  The game features stages cleverly based on other titles, while bringing its own charm. Who can forget Treasure Knight and his Metroid themed level? Or the towns based on Zelda 2? It brings everything that was amazing (from my limited experience) of the older generation, but updated everything that was awful and made me shake my head. This is one you definitely don't want to miss, if you are up for a little challenge.",9,10

metacritic,djfpforever,shovel-knight,"TL; DR - Shovel Knight is a refreshingly original 8-bit experience that steeps itself in nostalgia, paying deference to the most solid NES game experiences (DuckTales, Mega Man, Castlevania, SMB3): 10/10.

What an amazing game! As a child of the 80s, I had an original NES and LOVED Mega Man, Mario, Zelda et al in the prime of their 8-bit glory. Shovel Knight dips into that nostalgia while being genuinely engaging and entertaining in its own right. The game provides the perfect balance of fun, challenge, minor rpg elements (powering up mana vs. health), and level progression. The game includes fun achievements, which is something that I appreciate. Combine the excellent game play elements, a fantastic score, and lovingly created 8-bit art, and you come away with the total package here!

I Kickstarted this game, and my only regret is not chipping in more. Definitely well worth the 14.99 retail for those that purchase through Steam. I can't wait to see what else Yacht Club Games come up with in the future.  A highly enthusiastic 10/10 for Shovel Knight!",10,10
metacritic,Siccc,celeste,"not a big fan of pure platform games but with Celeste I had to change my mind.
At start I only wanted to experience first hand this cult and its simple yet profound lore. I would never expect to get so much into strawberry collection and discovering every secret. The developer put a lot of attention into making controls responsive, fair and accessible, the result is a journey into mastery, every death is an opportunity to learn instead of being frustrating.
the story and character are so relatable and introspective and the music perfectly set the tone for every stage of the game in term of effort and narration",9,10

metacritic,Neyland_,celeste,The best Platformer ive played ever! the way the story and the gameplay mix very well is amazing this game is perfect start to finish!,10,10
metacritic,Shend,celeste,"The best 2D Platformer ever made. Celeste succeeds in every category, big and small, and has no shortcomings. It has a beautiful soundtrack, clear and colourful 8-bit visuals and a concise and inoffensive story. The real star of the show is, of course, the platforming. Very few games can touch this one. Its an interesting flip on contemporaries like Mario, where instead of the player having a complex collection of abilities and powerups, the complexity is actually in the level design. Madeline has a small list of useful abilities: she can jump, dash, and climb. That's it. And yet it is in this simple set of tools that the player is tasked with mastering their movement, against some incredibly inventive and tough levels. And I mean very tough. You will die thousands of times on some of these levels. And yet, unlike other challenging games, Celeste avoids feeling frustrating. You respawn immediately, and lose very little progress when you die. You have infinite lives. Most of the challenging levels are optional, and there is even an assist mode if you need it. Celeste is one of those challenging games which does not overcomplicate things with a million different abilities and stats; instead it hands you a small collection of tools and demands perfection from you to see all the game has to offer. Overcoming these tough challenges is intensely satisfying, and makes for one of the most fun games in recent history. Maybe ever. 
If you are a fan of platformers, or just good games in general, play Celeste.",10,10

People compare this game to Metroidvania games like hollow knight and give it a 0 because its”movement is like a turd”or they give it a low rating because it’s too hard, but its supposed to be a hard, challenging game. It even has a feature where you get to make it as easy as you want and every bad review never talks about it. Overall is a hidden gem game and the soundtrack is amazing",9,10

Celeste is a speedy platformer that rewards the player for their effort put into the platforming, and stays on pace with the player as they get better at the game.

metacritic,zhubaino,celeste,"The best platformer I've ever played. The music, the design, the gameplay, the plot - everything in this game is great.",9,10
metacritic,thesologamer,celeste,"Released in its final version in 2018, Celeste is one of the most critically acclaimed indie games in videogame history, it is mostly praised for its touching story, fluid gameplay, great level design and soundtrack. Like many other great indie games such as Undertale, and Hollow Knight, Celeste isn't about being a huge game with hundreds of hours of content, extremely complex gameplay, and a story with thousands of plot twists. Instead, the developer and publisher of the game ""Maddy Makes Games” wanted a simpler game, with a more personal touch to it, but that had a bigger impact on people.

Initially, Celeste was developed in PICO-8 for a game jam in 2015. The game itself wasn't very big or complex due to the limitations of PICO-8 but also due to the devs’ limited time. However, this early version of the game made 3 years before its definitive release already included Celeste's core mechanics, main character and somewhat similar level design. From then on, the devs began developing a full game based on what they had already created, giving us Celeste only 3 years later. 

Celeste's core story revolves around Madeline, the character we play as, trying to deal with her inner struggles, when she decides to climb the Celeste Mountain. The player then has to go through many levels, each one presenting new challenges and gameplay mechanics. The mountain in the game is clearly an allegory for Madeline's struggles, and her process of climbing the mountain is the way overcomes them. The genius part of this plot is that it not only applies to the main character, but the players themselves may see their struggles in the game and relate to the main character even more. 

The story however is not the only aspect that makes this game standout, since the gameplay is also another defining factor in this game. The core movement of the game consists of moving left and right, jumping, and dashing. But don't get fooled if you think this is an easy game, because it is not, and will punish you a lot before you master the controls but not in a frustrating way, since there are lots of checkpoints throughout the levels, so you won't need to go 5 minutes back whenever you die. And the difficulty in Celeste not only creates a great gameplay, but also compliments the story by showing that not all problems can be overcome easily. 

Celeste definitely is a masterpiece that shaped the way indie games are being created by giving us a profound story that matches its gameplay challenges, while at the same time giving us relatively simple controls that are hard to master, but without being extremely frustrating to the point where you will want to quit the game. Instead, the difficulty motivates you to beat the game, while at the same time offering the player a ""calm” experience, that may also be relatable for many people who are going through or have gone through a similar experience of struggle.",9,10
metacritic,That1TNTguy,celeste,"This is THE best platformer I've ever played but it Is very challenging for some people luckily there is an assist mode for people who just want the story or aren't the best platformers, but if you love platformers and don't really care for the story (that is really good I don't know why you would skip it) you can always skip the cutscenes.

In a catalog of games so expansive as 2D platformers, it's often difficult to stand out and create something new and exciting. This game does it.
It's fast and each level is so well thought out. The game can be difficult, but is fair and well balanced. Additonally the story isn't amazing, but it's a cute simple story about a stubborn girl who wants to climb a mountain.

My only issue is the difficulty spike. At the end of the game you are given the opportunity to unlock one final post game level. Unfortunetaly I think 00.1% players unlocked that because in order to do that, you need to collect 4 peices of heart which are only obtainable  by beating these tuff as nails levels. These levels aren't just kind of hard either, if an average level is a solid 9/10 difficulty the heart peice levels are a solid 15-17/10. They are difficult, and unforgiving. Lastly even if you do complete the 4 levels and unlock the final level you are greated with a level that isn't as difficult and is like a 8/10 difficulty.

But the gameplay will be fully enjoyed only by those who like to physically memorize every movement of the route on a specific section and repeat it dozens of times before success (at least if you want to master 100% of the content). If you skip about half, you can run through the plot and improvise, but it's not too much fun to skip half of the game, because it can only be completed in the only way, or not in any way, and all this is not with the most responsive controls and average accuracy of hitboxes. It works great on **** story is OK, the atmosphere will do, the gameplay is not good for everyone, and this is the main drawback of this game. Even though my skill is above average in games, I couldn't have as much fun as I was promised by those who gave it 10/10. If you like everything I described above, it's 8/10, but if not, then no more than 6.5/10.",7,10

metacritic,Jobni,celeste,"I think it’s an overrated game. The music and story are fine, but the graphics are dull. I feel like it constantly shifts from being fun to really annoying and frustrating, which detracts from the overall experience. Even though there are 8 chapters with different appearances and characters, it mostly revolves around the same concept: finding a way out and collecting as many cherries as possible along the way, along with the videotape if you want to increase the challenge. I also find the controls to be a bit ‘loose.’ I often feel that Celeste doesn’t move the way I want her to. While there are good moments throughout the game, I don’t think it deserves the high rating it has received.",6,10

This is unfortunately my current favorite 2-D platformer. It's just so fun exploring every chapter and collecting as many strawberries as I can. Replaying this game is still such a blast with such intuitive platforming controls and a fun story. 

I will say, I would give it an 8/10 for its simplicity, but the story and themes I took from this game left me utterly surprised and it was something I did not expect to get from here.

Overall, it's a great game. A near-perfect one if the price was just lower as I don't tink there's enough content to warrant a $35 price tag. However, I have spent a long time playing this game so I'm unsure...",9,10
metacritic,RedMenacing,celeste,Maybe the worst experience I ever had playing a game. This game has frustrating gameplay and uncooperative controls. The visuals and art style fail to compensate for glaring design flaws. The narrative themes of self-discovery and perseverance fall flat with clichéd storytelling.

metacritic,P_Wings,celeste,"Celeste seems to have somewhat of a marmite quality. The game is a solidly designed, difficult precision platformer. The story, theming and music is what elevates this game for me however. 

The story follows Madeline as she climbs a mountain in order to confront her mental health problems. The game effortlessly combines its varied gameplay mechanics with its theming. The wind blowing against you is a metaphor for Madeline's mental anguish, the more maze-like levels designed to give you a sense of claustrophobia, a chase sequence involving your own shadow etc. I also found Madeline very relatable personally. 

These are the aspects that make me love this game, but if they don't appeal to you, there is still a great platformer game to be enjoyed here.",10,10
metacritic,PyroRaider,celeste,"Celeste surprised me with it's difficulty. I played this after completing Super Mario Odyssey, which was pretty easy, but this game is harder than I expected.

Well here it is: Hollow Knight is a wonderful game with challenging obstacles, a wonderful world to explore and so much more!

Sure you may not like the game for the first few minutes, (Same for me) but there are many wonderful guides to get you through the land of Hallownest (Windettes “Explained In Insults” is my favorite and can provide funny commentary) Now go out there and 112% the game?

metacritic,Limitless1737,hollow-knight,"Around a year ago, a friend of mine got this game and started talking about it non-stop. He said that it was one of the greatest games he had ever played.
Then, a year later, I downloaded Steam and decided to give it a try.
At first, like many others, I didn't really like it. I thought the same things about others who didn't like the game: the combat was boring, the exploration was pointless, blah blah blah.
However, I kept going, as my friend gave me a tip: to NOT GET DISCOURAGED BY THE EARLY GAME.
So i kept playing. 5 hours turned into 10. 10 into 20. 20 into 40. I was hooked.
This game is genuinely amazing. From the amazing artstyle to the wonderful soundtrack (shoutout to Christopher Larkin) this game has it all. The bosses are well made, and the sheer amount of content this has can keep you going for days.
The lore of this game is very complex and immersing, and the open world hides many well-hidden secrets, leading players to try and find a breakable wall, or a secret passage, which could lead to something great.
Of course, this game definitely still has its flaws. The early game really is kind of boring, and some places aren't fun to traverse. However, it does not mean that you shouldn't try out this game.
Now, with 80 hours of playtime, having achieved the true ending and beaten the first three Pantheons, I can say that my friend was right: it really is one of the greatest games I have ever played.",9,10

metacritic,Aigenki,hollow-knight,"Beginning :
The beginning is slow and boring. Easy bosses that have almost no purpose plague this game and make it waste even more of your time. There is no guidance for anything. The beginning made me wish I never paid for this.
Middle :
You are guaranteed to die on the mid-game bosses while trying to learn their attacks. The game punishes you for dying with a ton of backtracking. The entire meat of the game is walking around waiting to find a new ability or boss.
Endgame :
After all of the upgrades, there is no challenge. You spend your countless hours slaving away in godhome. Godhome is a garbage dlc that is half baked. Pantheons 1-4 are bearable but start to feel tedious chore when you introduce bindings into the mix. pantheon 5 is the most annoying, tedious, boring, stupid, and garbage time wasters that this game has. You go through 42 mostly easy bosses just to die to absrad, and her unfair attack patterns. Once you die, you have to go through the 40 minute torture again. This game is not a test of skill, but a test of endurance and patience. Why would you hide your ending in an area that majority of your fan base won’t be able to beat?

Do not buy this game. I am a perfectionist. Not completing this will make me feel like a failure. This game has actually had an effect on me mentally. It has made me bite, hit, and pull my hair out. If you want to play this game, forget that that fat slug called the Godmaker exists.",1,10

Most of the game/bosses while being challenging feel fair, and most times it only takes a little bit of practice or moves memorization to beat a certain boss. On top of that the controls are very responsive and this lets you move smooth as butter, which feels incredible, and gives you the perfect reaction time for everything. You never feel clunky or as if the controls were not responding.

metacritic,BroadTS,doki-doki-literature-club-plus,"After 100%ing this horror game disguised as a visual novel, I can comfortably say that it's a great and unique experience compared to every other horror game currently on the market. While you need to play on PC to really feel immersed, the story is split between two different narratives. The first is the player, or MC, joining a literature club and choosing a girl you want to ""fall in love"" with, while slowly realising that something unusual is happening. The second is Monika, who realises that she is the only person that knows she lives inside a game, and that MC is the only person that understands her and is real, leading to the events of the game. The artwork of the backgrounds and the characters are good, with issues with the setting of the game being addressed in series with humorous intent. The additional content mostly explains the lore of the game, both in-universe and the creation that led to Monika and the other characters. These also come with new beautiful soundtracks and artwork, adding a reward to taking a deeper look at the game.
Overall, a great experience that is full of surprises and an enjoyable experience all around, would recommend.",8,10

For the new stuff that was added, i like the way they went, especially with the Side Stories. Makes one understand all the characters' unique personality quirks, and the friendship between all of them is just beautiful to see (in my own, humble, f***ed up opinion).

Doki Doki is a game that is meant to be played on PC, since its greatest strength and, what makes it so special for so many people, ONLY makes sense if you're playing it on PC (Obviously I'm not going to spoiler).

For me it was a bit disappointing, since the big plot-twist that takes place in the story comes to be something I've already seen many other times in other games and it' s not a surprise.

metacritic,NindieSpotlight,doki-doki-literature-club-plus,"First developing quite a notorious reputation as a free title, DDLC has finally made its disturbing way to Switch… and with a few extra bits of content to boot, though they’re just niceties and don’t really move the needle much. To be clear, the warnings shown before you play aren’t to be taken lightly, and this game should be avoided by people who aren’t quite mature or those with depression or mental health problems as this is a title that will very likely trigger you in a serious way. All of that said, while in terms of pacing it isn’t a perfect game it’s also quite unsettling and will leave you with quite a bit to reflect on. That would include personal relationships, the mental health issues that can be around you beneath the surface, and certainly traditional romance games that DDLC starts out in the vein of but then takes an extremely hard and disturbing turn… or two, or three from. As someone who is steadily critical of semi-interactive visual novels you’d have to take this statement with a grain of salt, but by a fair margin this is the most compelling game associated with this genre I’ve ever seen, and its themes, imagery, and characters have a tendency to stick with you, pretty well no matter what specific paths you may choose. You’ll need to be sure to be patient, as signs of trouble don’t appear until maybe an hour in and it’ll take being over 90 minutes in before the rails fall off… but there’ll be no mistaking the point of no return and when it all goes to hell. It is absolutely not an experience appropriate for everyone but, for anyone who shouldn’t be avoiding it for various reasons stated above, I absolutely recommend it if you want a shock to your system and likely something to think about.

metacritic,KazuraCollins88,doki-doki-literature-club-plus,"Este juego es increíble, conmovedor, y todos deberían jugarlo alguna vez. Claro, es difícil que se experimente la sorpresa y plot twist, teniendo ya unos años desde su primera aparición. Sin embargo, apenas supe que tendría versión de paga, lo compré para apoyar al creador. Es un juegazo, y sin embargo, no considero que sea perfecto en las versiones de consola.

A l o que me refiero es que, obviando spoilers, el juego fue HECHO para jugarse en computador. Y la misma sensación no se transmite si en consola hay una pseudo máquina virtual al iniciar el juego.

Claro, se agradece el contenido extra, realmente es hermoso ver las historias previas a lo ya establecido en el juego. Sin embargo, el que haya nula interacción del jugador (sea por narrativa o no) se me hace algo aburrido, y decepcionante. Aún no estoy seguro si el juego en consola cuenta con contenido posterior a la historia principal, pero siendo honesto, ESO es lo que desearía de Doki Doki. Saber qué pasa después, qué ocurre con los personajes. Eso es lo que todos los fans se han preguntado por 3 años, y hasta han hecho mods en computador para satisfacer ese deseo.",9,10

Doki Doki Literature Club tente de vous amadouer
il vous prend la main, chaleureuse et pleine de bonté
il vous séduit, avec charisme, et un charme familier
il vous désarme, vous promet une aventure passionnée
il vous murmure à l'oreille, des mélodies sereines,
belles, qui amène un rideau noir sur l'écran de la tv.
et vous y croyez, jusqu'à qu'il vous arrache le coeur,
le balance au porc, ramasse leur merdes et comme un arnaqueur,
vous place ça à l'endroit où vous sentiez votre chaleur. Continuellement, continuellement, continuellement, continuellement, continuellement, continuellement.

Un Visual Novel ""classique"", avec des personnages typiques voir clichés mais qui ne sont pas utilisé pour dénoncer. De beaux visuels, et de jolies musiques qui font de ce jeu une de mes meilleures expériences vidéoludiques.

*SPOIL ICI*
En visual novel classique, dont on détourne trop souvent le terme pour parler de dating sim, le gameplay est limité, voir inexistant. C'est la partie qui blesse le plus car moins intéressante, et pourtant on simule un programme, on peut supprimer des fichiers, on sélectionne des mots pour faire de poèmes, on nous fait croire à un système de route d'héroïnes, mais ceci est une illusion, tout comme l'espoir de ken Sayori alors que le jeu est clairement classé Mature. Alors forcément la note non parfaite. L'énigme où on doit accélerer le temps reste un des  meilleurs pires moments du jeu.

Les illusions sont le point fort du jeu, est c'est grâce à toute la partie déraillante, glitchy, programme défectueux qu'il reste effrayant, car imprédictible. Ma première réaction face au suicide de Sayori ce fut d'aller voir à quoi je ressemble dans la glace, voir mes émotions. Tout cela marche très bien, et ne s'épuise pas vu que le jeu est très court. C'est un service continuel qui peut fatiguer certains joueurs, qui ne sont pas affecté par le brisage du 4ème mur. J'ai était surpris par son efficacité, et pourtant je suis difficile sur ce qui me fait peur.

Le jeu parle de sujets taboo, qui sont trop peu traités dans le jeu vidéo (suicide, scarification, problèmes mentaux, abus de confiance, obsession dangereuse...), mais ces sujets sont survolés et je trouve ca vraiment dommage de ne pas avoir essayer, c'est un filon d'or laissé à l'abandon. Il y a bien des moments d'ouverture où Sayori nous parle de sa déprime, mais c'est trop rare dans le jeu. J'aurais aimé pouvoir choisir mon héroïne après la route commune, et voir ce que cache chacune d'elle.

Le jeu est vraiment court, et malgré les défauts que j'ai cité, c'est quand même une folie à vivre, comme un bad trip conscient et quasi sans danger, il faut pouvoir apprécier le mal dans certains moments. Le masochisme c'est comme le sucre. Chaque joueur devrait laisser sa chance à ce monstre,  recommandez ce jeu au plus de monde possible dans la limite de la légalité.",9,10

This game is weird yall
Doki Doki Literature club is a 4 hour long narrative based gamewhere you play as yourself.. these 4 girls ar obsessed with you, youre the only boy in their literature club and you have to juggle their jealosy..
Wiriting poems by picking 20 words from a list that you think a certain girl will like to make them like you even more… and then things get weird.. no spoilers, but think portal, things will just randomly be like oh, what game am I laying, and this second half is the better part of the game.. but in general I just didn’t find the story or characters to be that compelling, im glad I went through this ride to see what all the fuss was a about,
it really is a game worth playing, but I didn’t care enough about the characters for the twists to really hit me as much as t should have.. which I feel is due to the repetitive nature of the story, with no real choices to make me feel like I was pushing the story towards any sort of direction, I was just reading and reading and reading, I like cute stuff, I like deep stuff, It’s the same story different day, bpick 20 new words, and I just couldntcare… which kinda left the 6 side stories in the plus version vs the main version to not really be wort hit for me in particular, for that reason id suggest just playing the main game for free, and if the world , the story, and charcters connect with you, go back and play through plus for that bonus content.. I however am not one of those people.
Overall Doki Doki Literature Club isa good game, with crazy wtf moments.. But lower your expectations before going in.. its not as great as everyone pretends it is.
I give Doki Doki Literatue Club Plus

Powiem że najbardziej opłaca się zrobić zakończenie pacyfistyczne bo ma poruszającą historię na końcu, ale też nawiązujemy przyjaźnie gdzie możemy podejmować decyzje, przez ten pacyfistyczny ending możemy poznać głębszą historię flowyego (the flower) czyli tego kwiatka co był na początku.

metacritic,Bahia8000,undertale,"One of the best indie of all time. Undertale is a great fresh experience. It has an incredible world, with memorable characters, songs and enviroments all over the place

Stoywise is its best thing, memorable and fun characters, some with somewhat deep writing. The premise is simple, a kid fell to a cave, and he wants to get out, but being pacifist or a genocide maniac has different outcomes. Going pacifist is a heartwarming incredible fest of character dialogue and writing, all fun till the end, everyone with their own quirks and personality and everyone with a nice unique design. If you go genocide you will see the horrors of it, how they fear you, the solitude, lack of song or emotion with a interesting ending

Gameplay wise is pretty good, its simple but fun, everyone can learn it and its fun. The thing thats most interesting is the mercy option. Most games which you dont kill makes you at least punch the monsters. Here (with some exceptions) you can just dialogue your way out of everything, some with emotional stuff, some funny.

The art is characteristic and pretty well done, especially on the characters. And the soundtrack is incredible too, banger after banger.

If i had to say something negative: Its a bit short, but i dont complain about that because the whole experience is fun to the end instead of having lots of filler. The art of scenarios is good but not too special in comparison to other indies. Neutral ending could be a bit better (tho there are some interesting things).

The most negative things are: Genocide run can be pretty boring because of having to kill hundreds of people and only 2 bosses. Pacifist for some people where a bit tedious because of backtracking. And by far the biggest issue of them all, one thats horrible, unseffarble, cringe and its what makes people that hate the game, hate the game: THE FANDOM",10,10
metacritic,Xenorfo,undertale,"In my opinion, ""Undertale"" is one of the best RPGs of the last decade, with its quirky humor, excellent and memorable characters, and beautiful art. It's a wonderful game; I highly recommend it, as it's simply a masterpiece, delivered by Toby Fox.",10,10
metacritic,KatieKittyKF,undertale,"One of my all time favourite games, the game while being short is crazy fun.

metacritic,zzitul,undertale,"by far the best RPG game i've ever played.

this story is amazing (especially for the pacifist route), almost every scene and character from this game memorable in a way or another, plays with your emotions at any moment (literally. it was the first and ONLY game which made me cry like crazy), the OST is without any doubt the best soundtrack ever (i have it on vinyl) and has some of the best fighting scenes in game history. in my opinion it's the peak of perfection for games.

Essa obra prima de RPG cheio de monstros e referências e etc etc etc. Apresenta uma história redonda e uma lore gigantesca e uma linda trilha sonora com boas teorias impecáveis mas TÃO IMPECÁVEIS, que eu comparo o jogo (Em nivel de história) Com Red Dead Redenption 2, tanto que eu considero o jogo melhor do que qualquer jogo ''Perfeito'' Porque mesmo tendo gráficos '' Horríveis'' O jogo apresenta como fazer decições, fazer amizades através de seu comportamento e o mais incrível é a continuação desta obra (Deltarune) Mostra que ele ''Não é um simples jogo criado por um programa aleatório feito por um jovem desempregado'' Ele mostra que não precisa de 8 anos para agradar detalhes,ou uma história complexa, mas precisa de 5 anos para mostrar detalhes ''Simples'' E uma história impecável inspirado na vida de uma pessoa triste para mostrar que tudo pode ser feito com um bom coração.

1. THE PLOT
So it's basically a kid falling down into this place simply called ""the underground"" and the place is full of that monsters that are super quirky but the place is like super tiny and so the kid begins trying to find its way out of there.

2. THE GAMEPLAY
It's a watered down version of Bullet hell but it's not SUPER watered down. It's like the middle point of Noobs and pros  enjoying the game and still having a challenge. That's it. 

3. THE SOUNDTRACK 🫨
Magnificent.

The ""only"" Complaint i have is like 1 detailed specific boss fight being super duper hard (IT'SNOTTHEONEYOUREPROBABLYTHINKINGOFISWEAR) But i low-key don't want toby to fix it at all.

The game is actually super kid friendly even if you do   s o m e t h i n g s.

metacritic,unbelievableguy,undertale,"First of all, it is necessary to determine which unity Undertale addresses in the video game industry. Years ago, Dost Kayaoğlu said in his review of this game that the game appeals to a special audience. It is obvious that this diagnosis is made with the idea of ​​​​players of multiplayer games, and in this respect, it is valid. However, while Undertale is drawing a route for itself, its effort to avoid the complicated as much as possible is included in this route. This means that it makes a general speech by approaching the levels of the game's sections to the simple. It should be considered together with the fact that Undertale addresses a special unity, that Undertale consists of a composition of species. Otherwise, there are not even complex outlines in the narrative, gameplay, and design. For example, the main subject in the scenario was the war between humans and monsters. Frisk represented all of humanity. A reasonable representation of humanity can only be made with partnerships. Thus, Undertale presents the simple and uncommon main character in this way. Long-term analyses can be made on the scenario, I think that doing so will not contribute to the understanding of the game. Because what the game conveys to the player is a very entertaining presentation of the struggle of the two communities. When he wanted to impose thoughts, he did it by using the characters' mouths. When I move on to the design, here, the people who made the game can be praised one after another, because this is the one that provides the greatest assistance to the other elements. Also, even when tried to be considered on its own, there can be an aesthetic side. I think the reason for this is that pixel errors create an image that allows it to be read as a suitable part of a whole. For example, let's talk about the characters, take a closer look at the design of Frisk's or Sans' bodies. This is a huge mistake for art creation authorities who progress with the ideology of photorealism. Thus, it is also understandable why Undertale is called Undertale. Due to this preference, pixel errors (I say pixel errors because I mean that game engines can easily provide smoothness in this age, otherwise we cannot think the same way for Final Fantasy VI) stop being a defect and contribute to this tale. I've talked about it so much, let me talk about the tale a little bit. Undertale can be described as a wonderful union of modern fairy tales and video games. When thinking about Undertale, we should not forget this. Toby Fox must have been aware of what he was doing, he made the formula of the game the same as the formula of a fairy tale. For example, Frisk had to face King Asgore against the rules brought by the drama in the scenario - of course he could not go against it. He used the power of the fairy tale against the question of ""Where did this come from?"" to create extraordinary scenes in the game. We can give all the scenes where Mettaton is present as an example. This can be called the power of the modern fairy tale. Aesop's fables are not open to extraordinary moments, whereas phantasma is constantly found in these fables. Undertale, on the other hand, is a work built on a formula and constantly trying to destroy this formula.",7,10

Undertale is full of quirky characters with no personality that you can't empathize with, a beautiful graphic style with a pixelated retro that is very reminiscent of the SNES, although details are missing when it comes to combat making it feel empty. And the worst thing is the message it has, Undertale has three routes with three different endings: the pacifist, neutral and genocidal route. In one we have to be an ass-licker and be friends with everyone, in another we can do whatever we want whether it be forgiving or killing our enemies and in the other, my favorite, we have to kill everything that crosses our path.

This small 2D RPG was never intended to receive the enormous popularity it did, but looking back at it, it's clear why that happened. With a small budget to make a game, Toby Fox wanted to try his first ever project, and so created one of the most amazing stories ever portrayed in gaming history. Every character feels like they have deeper secrets or have problems that you can help them overcome, while also being the complete opposite of boring. There's a large variety of areas throughout the game that encourage you to try different things that no other RPG would. This game is also unique for its ability to completely change its tone depending on player decisions, altering its music and sound effects entirely. Speaking of which, Undertale may very well have the greatest soundtrack of any game ever created, with everyone from non-Undertale fans to first-day followers easily being able to nod their heads to the phenomenal tracks that Toby Fox has created. Overall, an absolute masterpiece that every gamer should try at least once.",10,10

Bueno, creo que MKXI es mejor, en casi todo de hecho, primero me parece increíble lo que el equipo de desarrollo ha hecho con el motor grafico Unreal Engine 3, si 3... La fluidez que se logro y la belleza estética supera a MKX sobre todo porque el ya mencionado se sentía un poco pesado. En este juego conseguimos algo mas liviano, mas fluido .Me gustaron bastante los escenarios y la historia, las cinemáticas muy pulidas y el montón de skins y personajes creo que son los justos parea lograr un equilibrio perfecto entre la plantilla anterior y la nueva. Creo que no me gusta mucho que la familia Cage viene siendo la especie de protagonista desde hace un par de entregas cosa que se repite aquí, pero bueno, eso es minúsculo con la cantidad de añadidos y la consistencia en la historia, que de un tiempo para acá a subido bastante el nivel explicativo.

metacritic,k3lvin33,mortal-kombat-11,"Um jogo com uma excelente jogabilidade, gráficos bons, uma história ok, mas nada memorável... Porém, o principal problema de Mortal Kombat 11, é o fato do jogo ser pouco atrativo para jogar ele por bastante tempo, além de ser um absurdo no quesito micro transações, nem as DLC's salvaram.",5,10
metacritic,Kostas_Spirou,mortal-kombat-11,"Prior to buying this game, I was sceptical because I haven't touched a Mortal Kombat game in a very long time, and now I can see why.

This franchise has been on a steady decline ever since it went full corporate scum with the egregious DLC practices, overpriced expansion packs and locking fan favorite characters behind paywalls.

The amount of grinding required in order to unlock new skins or cosmetics is ridiculous.

Don't get me wrong, the core foundation of the game is still good, the gameplay is fun, I don't really like the slow movement though, the characters feel clunky, it's a bit too slow for my liking, but overall it's fun to play once you get used to it.

There's a lot of offline and online content, and the new Krypt is decent, I actually enjoyed exploring the island.

Everything outside of the gameplay is pretty damn underwhelming though, the story mode is painfully boring, with stretched out sections that feel like filler and could've been removed, way too many cliches that made me roll my eyes or facepalm multiple times, and dumb multiverse shenanigans.

Also, is it just me, or do the characters look... strange? They look like cosplayers I swear, the realistic faces unironically make them look more cartoony, it's so weird.

I don't know why, I just didn't really enjoy it as much as I expected, it's not bad, just boring I guess, I probably won't play Mortal Kombat again for a while.

Users seeking to execute special maneuvers may find themselves frustrated by the stringent precision required to activate them. Even minor deviations, such as a slight displacement to the left during leftward or rightward movement, can lead to failed inputs, thereby inhibiting the intended action. Regrettably, the game lacks the flexibility to customize control mappings to suit individual preferences. For instance, the command for executing a dash remains rigidly fixed as a double-tap of the forward input, offering no room for user-defined adjustments.Furthermore, the overall responsiveness and fluidity of character movements leave much to be desired, as characters appear to traverse the game environment at an unacceptably sluggish pace. In summary, it becomes evident that the game's appeal largely stems from its past success and reputation, rather than its commitment to aligning itself with current industry standards.

Number 1, the game been slow it's not an issues for me, since i think it makes punches and attacks have more like power and it looks really cool imo. But gameplay wise what i don't really like about htis game is the stupid krushing blows, it gets really anoying when the only ways to make great combos is either by spending meters or by using the KB and i hate that, since even in the 3D era it was very easy to do very cool combos. Also the krypt is so broken, and so annoying. They idea is cool but that i can only use it with internet and that is all random, looses the point of the krypt in the old games. And JC the story is so bad, so full of character assassinations and not in a MK way. They literally got every MK character and just makes them worse. This is not a bad game, it's just that it isn't the kind of game you'll like to came back to replay when MK game comes out. The soundtrack is actually good and i really enjoy the customization of the characters. And also the graphics looks amazing.

Because they took all the iconic characters and absolutely ruined their look, in every way possible. They made all female characters as ugly as possible and gave them worst possible outfits of any fighting game. They don't even look like same characters anymore. I hope they explain in next game that MK11 Kitana was just from another Universe and now classic REAL Kitana is back. Because if they don't, i wont even care if they make MK12. MK11 was literally insulting video game. Only character that looked good was Noob Saibot, only character. That's not enough and ruining legacy characters is not good way to sell your game either. Why was Kitana Asian, serious question. Why? She has ALWAYS been white. Always. in every game ever, she was white and in movie she was also white woman. Why or even how, would you randomly change her race? It makes no sense. Absolutely no sense. And all the costumes were trash as well. MK9 remains as last and also one of the best MK games ever, MKX was fine, but didn't have best roster and sadly MK11 ruined it all. I rather play any 2002-2006 era MK game than 11. These games were way better, had way better looking characters and actually good costumes. Also why would they ruin Skarlet like that? She was my favorite new female character in MK9 and in MK11 she looks NOTHING like in that one. She looks like completely different person. It's not enough that you say ""-this is Skarlet"". No. She needs to look like one as well. It's like making sub-zero Pink and saying ""well this is sub zero now"", Doesn't work like that. Not even sure they can fix any of this in MK12. Would they just go back to old looks from MK9 and say that MK11 was mistake? Would they make Kitana White again? pretty sure they wont, so sadly i'm confident MK is over.

Arguably the best fighting game I've played in recent memory, this game is absolutely fantastic.

The gameplay is incredible and surprisingly very simple, it's easy to learn but hard to master, which is great for newcomers like myself.

Every character looks phenomenal, they're all so diverse and cool, the character designs rock! All of them play very differently from each other, it's all about finding which one fits with your playstyle and getting better and better.

I didn't really like the story mode personally, but the lore is huge, there are so many things to learn about each character and the world, I'm just not sure if it's worth learning because things get very complicated.

And probably one of the most important parts of the game, the soundtrack... slaps soooo hard, holy shiiiiii- I love the music so much, and it fits with the art-style perfectly, it's crazy.

I don't know about every gamer out there but a small learning curve is ok, but when you have to watch 50 minute YouTube videos to just understand how to get some other characters down to your level, it just doesn't make sense to put so much effort into something that is not meant to be like that in the first place.

Recomento para quem ama jogos de lutas 11/10",10,10
metacritic,RobertoNeg,guilty-gear-strive-,"Melhor Jogo de luta da atualidade.
Partidas online impecável, sem travamento, tag etc...
Muito barato.
Se eu fosse você compraria.",10,10
metacritic,DutchPotato,guilty-gear-strive-,"Everytime I get on I quit the game frustrated due to the games terrible lobbies refusing to let me play against people standing right in front of me, which can seemingly only be fixed by quitting the game and relaunching, which is a painfully slow process even on PS5 due to how long it takes for the game to communicate to the server on start up. The game is very fun when u can play against other people, but with the current online state combined with a pretty slim selection of single player options no reason to buy the game in it's current state.",4,10
metacritic,Raios-Rogue,guilty-gear-strive-,this is my first introduction into the guilty gears series this is quickly turning into one of my favourite fighting games and i feel like i am playing the best of of the guilty gears series i played a bunch of dragon ball fighterz i know how good arc system works are the music in this game is one of the best music i have heard in any game it suits the fighting game the art style of this game is breathtaking i already have a favorite character Zato-One that's voiced by the voice actor Takehito Koyasu he has voiced DIO from jojo bizarre adventure and many other anime characters arc system works animations is top notch it's a spectacle to behold if you love fighting games this is a must play,10,10
metacritic,Firefistace117,guilty-gear-strive-,"This and Xrd Rev 2 are two of the Best Fighting games you can find, The music is mostly absolute bangers and The gameplay and depth in this game is Absolutely top tier while Making it more Easier for a newer audience to get into.
This game has BY FAR the best Graphics and Animations ive ever witnessed in any fighter period, absolute masterclass in the artwork department, and the Roll back netcode is increadible this is the smoothest online fighting experience you can find but unfortunately the lobby **** ass and Arcade mode Final boss is uh... Well quite cheap if ya face the hardest version of it lol. Its not perfect but it deserves a 10 simply for being as close to perfection as possible in the fighting game Genre absolute must buy!!",10,10

metacritic,JayCagigas,guilty-gear-strive-,"Truly amazing. it was 100% worth waiting for the years of development!
The quality of animation and gameplay makes it not only a playable spectacle in video games, but also puts it at the level of the best anime creations ever created! very enjoyable, I recommend it not only to lovers of fighting games, but to anyone who wants to fill their eyes with the spectacular nature of this product!",10,10
metacritic,sergio123456,guilty-gear-xrd-revelator-,"El juego es muy bonito estéticamente, variedad de personajes y movimientos, quizá se echa en falta modos de juego más atractivos, así como su traducción al castellano.",7,10
metacritic,Mezzeruk,guilty-gear-xrd-revelator-,So bloody late getting to this fighter but man is it good. Its created with so much passion and detail. It's a striking looking game. It's fighting gameplay is both varied and fun and it's full of content. I almost missed this and now today after buying its up there with the very bloody best.,10,10
metacritic,AtomoDelFinal,guilty-gear-xrd-revelator-,"As someone who had never played any Guilty Gear before, I found this game to be a challenging fighting game with some mediocre weak points.

PROS: great graphics, awesome BGM, challenging combat, unique characters with their own combat styles.
CONS: story mode (it's just cinematics, you don't actually ""play"". Also too much information, hard to get what the heck's going on if you've never played any GG game).",8,10
metacritic,JonathanN01,guilty-gear-xrd-revelator-,"Guilty Gear Xrd Revelator is hands down the best fighting game I‘ve ever seen it has excellent visual graphics, incredible combos and well-made characters, with excellent stories and, cinematics are the best, you must play this game now. This is also my first review I make about videogames on metacritic.",10,10
metacritic,DenX,guilty-gear-xrd-revelator-,"This is by far the best fighting game out there !
Stunning graphics, great gameplay and awesome music. it's fast paced, has a good story and even his tutorial mode is so good that it puts every other fighting game to shame !
It's really a pleasure to see so much efforts and passion was put into it.
I didn't see that since the good old days of Capcom/SNK...",10,10
metacritic,ArianLight,guilty-gear-xrd-revelator-,This is my first guilty gear game. This game is the hardest fighting game to master that I have ever played. It is truly worth mastering also. I was starting to prefer 3D fighting games until I played this.,10,10
metacritic,MustardTiger612,guilty-gear-xrd-revelator-,"Excellent, deep, challenging gameplay. This is not a button masher and takes work to improve but it certainly is rewarding when you do step up a level or two. It is a must buy if you even sort of like fighting games.

My only fighting game experience is SFII and Mortal Kombat (yes the originals) - get ready to learn several new techniques, meters, and specials. Arcade mode is great for learning the game, as is M.O.M. mode - a single-player version with some RPG-style progression to it.

Pros: Gameplay and mechanics - graphics and sound (the important things), good balance of on and offline activities
Cons: Online player base is a little small, story mode is pretty weird and isn't interactive",10,10
metacritic,Imperial_Ray,guilty-gear-xrd-revelator-,"ps4 version steals playerbase from pc version and this game doesn't have the GGX version of awe of she

also **** minigame 2 it can go die in a fire forever",0,10
metacritic,consolfreak1982,guilty-gear-xrd-revelator-,"As a huge Fan of the Guilty Gear Series I was literally blown away by the predecessor ""Sign"" - theres hardly any other 2D Game out there thats as graphically stunning than this one (well, BlazBlue from the same devs lol). Since ""Sign"" left off with a huge cliffhanger Story wise (and much to be desired when it Comes to the character roster) - Revelator packs up as a full fledged Sequel, continuing the Story, adding a few chars and tweaking/improving the Systems even further.
In short, the new chars are Overall pretty great, though I admit ist a huge letdown that two of them have to be bought with real cash (they were free to download for a while). And as much as Johnny, Jam and Dizzy are welcomed yet again to the roster, the new chars like Jack-O, Kum and Raven also add to the huge variety of the GG chars and fit in very well in both design and fighting style.
Still a shame that so many of the past chars are still absent (just to save em up for future installments).
The Story mode is - yet again - a sorta 3 hrs Long Anime movie that catches up where ""Sign"" left off and Ends with .. you know it ... a huge cliffhanger as soon as things start to get really interesting.
The Online Mode has been vastly improved in ist awkward design, with Lobbys and Avatars to meet up, Chat, and of  course  compete.
Theres hardly any lag noticeable as far as I have experieced, but - GG is not so populated online as Id wish.
Finding a ranked match can take forever if you are lookin in another Region than US or JP.
For single Players theres also plenty to do - a very good Tutorial, Combo Training and Challenge Mode teach you all there is to know about the complex fighting mechanics, the Arcade and VS Modes are kinda self explainatory, with the Survival Mode ""MOM"" being the star of the Show here (where you collect medals, can buy Upgrades for your character and dive deeper an deeper). Theres also a Gallery mode where you can spend the ingame earned Money for new Character Colors, Artworks and Stuff like that.
The graphics and the Soundtrack have to be mentioned especially, since its even imporoved over the predecessor - eveything Looks sharper.
The only real negative about this game is the lack of so many characters that I grew attached to as a Long term fan, that two chars from the roster have to be bought with real Money as a highly overpriced DLC, and that the Story leaves you with a cliffhanger like someone cuts off the energy in the middle of a tense fight.
Dont worry though - Revelator2 is announced already, so in a few months (spring 2017) it will all continue.
Its also a shame that there is no english voiceover - I get extremely annoyed by japanese voices (I know thats weird coming from an Anime Fan) but thats not as much of a big deal as the missing characters (Justice, Testament, Kliff, Bridget - what the hell ArcSys lol).
Also kinda sad that there will be almost as many updates to ""Xrd"" as there have been with ""X"" before.
Milk that cow ArcSys.
Apart from that - probably the best fighting game of this gen so far.
Must buy for anyone that has interest in fighting games.",9,10
metacritic,GreenSkullRider,guilty-gear-xrd-revelator-,"El tercer mejor juego de lucha de la generación actual, solo detrás del respetado King of fighter 14 y el genial Killer Instinct. muy buenos graficos en 3d, gran animación, soundtrack bestial, plantel de lucha aceptable pero mejorable, largo, historia entretenida modos offline y online variaditos y divertidos. excelente juego",9,10
metacritic,jingQ,guilty-gear-xrd-revelator-,"+ You can see A rough story of the previous work
+ Main storymode is just like watching anime. but Most of Cutscene is awesome
+ Digital figure mode
+ The best Shell Shading Graphic you've ever heard.
+ great Hitting feeling,hit effects,A special move

- The game itself is difficult. not kidding, every combo,control.... whatever. this game just difficult.
There are not have enough Beginner characters

- The Fighting games can be have worst matchmaking you've ever heard.
this game is don't have matchmaking like a tekken 6.
For example, match of tekken6. when you join match. and just wait a few second,
Automatically matches player,ping,class. don't need a host and entrant. That's it.

but this game...(sigh)
you can be a host or challenger.
host is make a match. and wait until come challenger
The challenger can see the host created match list. and you can see hosts class and ping.
Select and connect match.

Of course, this game have a filter to the ping and skills before joining.
but this system is Uncomfortable",9,10
metacritic,BARRKKK,guilty-gear-xrd-revelator-,"I love this game, is fantastic, great graphics and gameplay... but we need baiken, more costumes for everyone, more stuff for the gallery, like artwork, sketches and more dlc with other characters, please make it happen, Arc System Works",10,10
metacritic,Toffee_Popcorn,guilty-gear-xrd-revelator-,"Easily the best fighting game out there. Great visuals, tutorial, music and character design. I was a SF player for years, but this game converted me. Rock on!",10,10
metacritic,kfenix,guilty-gear-xrd-revelator-,"Guilty Gear Xrd -Revelator- takes familiar controls and creates something truly unique in the fighting genre. The story is a little hard to digest, but the gameplay and mechanics of the game are flawless. Chances are you'll play the game so much, the story becomes organically apparent. It is a must play for fans of fighting games.",9,10
metacritic,Romano_cl,guilty-gear-xrd-revelator-,"Best fighting game since Sign and King of Fighters XIII. Best fighting game for 'next gen' consoles. Absolutly great characters, incredible music, beautiful visuals, FUN, and a lot of single player content.

If you have a PS4 and love Fighting Games (Not only Street Fighter, a true fighting game fan) you can't miss it.",10,10
metacritic,ultimatesoll,guilty-gear-xrd-revelator-,"Clearly, majority of the previous game is remain same in this ""new"" sequel. No doubt Arc System still following the same routine that they did with Blazblue formula. Offering almost nothing in terms of extra contents comparing to previous one. In addition to some new stages, old stages are also swapped into new design, overall visuals are slightly enhanced. Not to mention that two new characters are already confirmed as DLC long before the release date (da heck ?) At the end of the day, it's just a fast money consumer crap made by greedy Arc System.﻿ If you haven't tried the Xrd yet, new installment may be useful opportunity this time.",3,10
metacritic,bueno79,guilty-gear-xrd-revelator-,"Juste exceptionnel. Les animation, le training, le mode **** MULTI !!! c'est juste de la folie. Ils ont reussi un tour de force incontestablement. GG rev se place comme le meilleur jeux de combat sur le marche a l'haure **** moins",10,10
metacritic,ootinii,guilty-gear-xrd-revelator-,"The lack of an English dub keeps this score lower than it should be. Then English voice acting for SIGN was quite good, and it's definitely a negative to not have this alternative set of voices. I only put this note here because of what I have read on a lot of forums as of late, but ""player nostalgia"" is not a good excuse for not properly localizing the audio for an audience. This lack of English will also hinder the game's ability to attract new players. In particular, not having Slayer's English voice is a sin (no pun intended).

However, the new graphics effects are quite good and add some great polish to the visual experience. The new fight mechanics, such as the ability to overdrive with a burst and the blitz attacks, make for more interesting and complex fight situations. Tutorials and formerly Challenges, now called Combos, have seen some improvement in detail as well. Overall, there are both pros and cons to this newest Guilty Gear installment.",7,10
metacritic,BMX999,guilty-gear-xrd-revelator-,"Excelente juego, buenos graficos, personajes carismaticos, sistema de jugabilidad satisfactorio y los tiempos de cargas son realmente cortos, ojala salgan varios DLCs, con mas personajes y si se puede mas trajes para los personajes, y mas actividades para realizar con el avatar, cosas sencillas como sentarse o respirar lo harian sentir mas vivo",10,10
metacritic,Nocturno999,guilty-gear-xrd-revelator-,"Incredible art style, deep game play and robust tutorial. The online lobby is a mini game by itself while waiting for opponents. Very good story mode with animesque computer art style (no game play though).

One of the most complete packages this generation which is rare to say these days. Even the physical game comes with a manual.",10,10

metacritic,kacho2018444444,injustice-2,es muy buen juego y yo vengo del injustice 1 y me gusto mucho quede encantado con el lore del juego lo malo es que reutilizaron algunos mapas del primer juego y combos de personajes la verdad q me gustaria mas si pondrian mejores mapas y no reutilizarlos...... y la personalizacion d personajes esta muy buenooo me re gusto eso... aclaro la historia esta muuuuuuy buena recomendable y mas si vienen del primer juego,8,10
metacritic,AGothamCityCat,injustice-2,Random loot box system & stiff fighting mechanics. Needed to add more arenas and environments to fight in.,5,10
metacritic,AverageJoe809,injustice-2,The story didn't interest me. The randomized loot online is annoying. The fighting is good & takes skill to master.,7,10
metacritic,KINGH0PE17,injustice-2,"This game is an easy 10/10 in my book and by far one of the best fighting games ever and this is coming from a Dc comics fanboy. This game has everything you could want in a fighting game. great story, amazing graphics, amazing characters and gear sets chef's kiss I'm just hoping injustice 3 is as good as injustice 1 and 2 and nothing like mk1 that is probably the worse fighting game out to date",8,10
metacritic,SirCheesebal,injustice-2,"To be honest, I never actually played the game, but it really looks like a polished, perfectly balanced masterpiece of a fighting game, let alone a DC game. Nice job, Netherealm Studios, you made a good fighting game that isn't Mortal Kombat (even though Sub Zero and Raiden are both in this game as guest characters). I also like the game because of the guest characters. They're not as questionable or outright weird like 2019's Mortal Kombat 11, in fact, they're surprisingly good (I really love the addition of the TMNT in this game)!",8,10
metacritic,Adarxr,injustice-2,"Nice game, but a bit shallow, graphics just ok, the mechanichs are very good, frenetic combat. The plot is not that good but have good moments",7,10
metacritic,lostleader,injustice-2,"Aside from a few continuity problems I have with this game, I do like how the story mode just ups the stakes in a feasible way. It's really nice to see how they build on the first game, and still set up fights with choices you make. Again it's a bit formulaic, but it fits well enough. The fighting has also been retooled a bit and feels less stiff compared to the first Injustice. I do wish there was some fun for the DLC characters to do something in the story or to simply have more characters in the story as a whole, but at least all the guest characters are fun to play with as well. I can't say the same for the loot box system they put in the game however, and it really makes me confused why such a thing exists, as it's largely for two modes that don't really do anything. Still it has a great trial mode, and a better tutorial for more advance techs then most fighting games. If you want to get into fighting games, Injustice 2 would be a good start.",8,10
metacritic,lazyssj,injustice-2,"Garbage story if you actually like comics. Fundamentally misunderstands the majority of character used in this story. The story is terrible no matter the medium in which is told. The story is also quite short too.

Core gameplay is fun and customizing looks of heroes and battling favorite heroes is fun online. Play for the gameplay, not for the story.",6,10
metacritic,RythVz,injustice-2,not bad,7,10
metacritic,OgnistyKamilek,injustice-2,"Very good game. Personally, I don't play games of this genre, but considering the universe, I couldn't ignore it. I think that in such games, one of the most important elements that make the gameplay enjoyable is the graphics. This one is really at a good level. Comparing it to other graphics from this type of games, we see that Injustice is the best. I also like the diversity of the maps we play on. The combat is satisfying and fun. The plot, like the plot in this type of games, is not exciting, but it is enough. The online storylines, weapons, and characters are also very well done.",8,10
metacritic,Phuz,injustice-2,"Taking in to consideration I hate the typical Hollywood cheese, this game really pulls it off.  It is fun combat.  Pretty much a variation of Mortal Kombat.  The story mode **** on that sack of **** Batman film that somehow manages to loiter around the IMDB top 10 films.  Injustice 2 works on every aspect.  Fun to play, engaging story due to the fights integrated, good mechanics, good roster.  I just tried a bit of the DLC today and the TMNT one is pretty good.  Great that the story blurs the lines between the good guys and the bad guys.  Don't get me wrong, there's no depth to the story but it doesn't matter because the fighting brings the excitement.  Again, think Mortal Kombat.

For a while **** ton of franchises I can't stand, I really enjoy this game.  Great fighter.",10,10

metacritic,gutu_69,injustice-2,"A unica coisa que achei boa nessa cópia de Mortal Kombat foi a história, além de ser uma cópia ruim pra caralho esse lixo ainda tem uma coisa que ao meu ver é repugnante um sistema que se constitui em você evoluir as armas e vestimentas do seu personagem para torna-lo mais forte, ESSA PORRA É UM RPG OU UM JOGO DE LUTA CARALHO!?",2,10

metacritic,Strogs,injustice-2,"What a terrible game. I created a profile just to submit this. I understand what it is the free game of the month. The game does not keep up with your inputs, you try to string a special together and it uses the basic form instead. The only saving grace is the story, which is good for the hour you play it. Spend your money elsewhere.",1,10
metacritic,theamateur,injustice-2,"(Story mode specifically)
Injustice 2 is DC at its best, with complex and rich characters, fun game-play and a story that pushes different icons throughout DC history on paths that would almost never be explored for their characters.
Game-play is adequate and feels really good when you find a knack for it. With a few minor issues such as the general overwhelming nature of the game-play for those not veteran to a fighting genre, an aggravating tutorial and the final boss being unnecessarily frustrating, injustice 2 is just short of reaching a 9. Would recommend for any fan of side-scroller fighting",8,10

metacritic,Strife69420,injustice-2,"Game is pretty fun. Gameplay is nice, visuals are too, and just from what I remember the OST was pretty good as well. To me though, the game didn't really feel all that fun though. The mechanics were very linear, and controls felt boring to me, at least IMO. Contrast this with a game like Blazblue, the controls feel a lot more free form, the companion system feels fun, and character moves are all really unique and fun to use. In a fighting game, I want uniqueness, and fun controls rather than something like this in my opinion.",6,10

That’s clearly changed now, but Injustice 2 holds a special place in my heart because of that. The story is really great (no shocker) DC is known for its amazing extended universe content. The graphics are still really damn good too. The game is a joy to play too, the fighting is extremely fluid and the sound design is spectacular.

metacritic,Dragovitc,injustice-2,"this game is really really well made i didn't play the first one but i understood the story which is really good too the comparing it to mkx (which is a awesome game too btw) it feels way smooth and fast the combos require more precision and timing rather than mashing the buttons, the characters moves are so cool the super moves are super cool the new gear mechanic has it's pros and cons it allows you to fully customize and make your own character the cons is the slight pay to win mechanism there are these rich kids that spend hundreds on loot boxes to get the best gear possible and the casual games pairs you with anyone ready that means if you just getting started with 1k-2k in gear points it is very possible to pair you with someone with 7-9k if stats that can finish your entire bar with a combo the loot boxes really **** they should've been more creative with it like they recreated the towers from mk with the multiverse they could've easily added something else to replace the krypt (yes you can win motherboxes by leveling up or wining in the multiverse but it's so slow and very random  like if i am maining batman i need gear for batman not other characters i never used (my main characters are black adam,batman and i rarely win any gear for them)) so yeah loot boxes really really **** this is not a mobile game i am paying full price fir the ultimate edition also i am not saying they should give away everything like that they should add a challenge system for every piece if gear or you can fond it in some other place like the krypt. so yeah to finish it iff the games is really good definitely don't buy the ultimate edition tho i bought it and i rarely use any dlc characters but if you're looking forward for a character from the dlc than you can buy it separately a a solid 8 for me.",8,10

The roster has some marvelous additions and the developers deserve credit for continuing to support and balance the game post launch. If you enjoy DC Comics, or fighters, you need to add this title to your collection.",9,10
metacritic,Kemet_,street-fighter-6,"To me, Street Fighter 6 is the worst a fighting game can get. The game looks bad, the gameplay feels awful and confusing, and the art direction is a disaster… In short, I find no enjoyment in it. I’m not an expert in versus fighting, but as a casual player, I just don’t like it at all. None of the three game modes appeal to me, I couldn’t find one that suited me. I pushed through to get the platinum trophy, and it was pure torture.",2,10

metacritic,Shenandoah,street-fighter-6,"I got this on sale and I still feel it wasn’t worth the money. The whole game feels really weird. I need to
install Arcade/Versus as a DLC because the game basically focus online multiplayer which I never play. The story mode feels just cheap, collecting stupid images also called “cutscenes” lol. Blanka feels like a bad meme, it’s a shame. The first thing in the game is a woke introduction, It’s really hard to believe how bad it was integrated. But the weirdness isn’t over. All my creations with the character editor looks like garbage. I can’t change graphics settings on my PS5 but the game is looking like a PS4 game. The whole world tour feature is a pure waste of money they have put into. The game visuals are blurry and didn’t feel like a proper iteration of Street Fighter for the current generation. But the “extra payment DLCs train” is still running. Almost everything really feels odd to me. I’m very disappointed. I’m looking forward to get at least some visual improvements for the PS5 Pro to let me put my hands on this title again.",5,10

metacritic,overlord23,street-fighter-6,"Street Fighter 6 delivers a revitalized experience for both veterans and newcomers to the series, introducing significant updates to its mechanics, visuals, and modes. The game successfully blends the classic Street Fighter style with modern touches, offering more accessibility while preserving its competitive edge. The game's controls are more forgiving than in previous entries, thanks to an improved Modern Control scheme. This gives new players easier access to combos and special moves, without sacrificing depth for seasoned fighters. That said, the traditional control scheme is still available for long-time fans who prefer the classic method​. The character roster is extensive, with a mix of returning favorites such as Ryu, Ken, and Chun-Li, and new fighters like Kimberly and Luke, who have been featured in recent Street Fighter lore. The game’s balance between the old and the new ensures that both legacy fans and fresh players have exciting options to explore​. Visually, Street Fighter 6 impresses with its modern, vibrant aesthetic. The character models are detailed, with expressive animations that make each fighter feel unique. The stages are dynamic and interactive, with a variety of locations around the world, each with its theme and feel. Additionally, the game’s use of improved engine results in smoother animations and improved overall graphics​. Street Fighter 6 is a thrilling entry in the franchise that brings something for everyone, from casual players to competitive enthusiasts. With its accessible controls, new mechanics, rich modes, and impressive visuals, it’s poised to continue the legacy of one of the greatest fighting game franchises of all time.",9,10

metacritic,Rixalot,street-fighter-6,"Overall, a pretty good game that could have been great with a few adjustments.  First of all, making you sign into a Capcom account every time you turn the game on is annoying and breaks the immersion.  Secondly, having players unavailable right off the bat because you didn't buy the ""Deluxe"" version was off-putting.  Lastly, the idea of a story mode is great, but is a bit grindy and tedious.  You essentially need to fight every person you encounter on the street as you're going from point A to B throughout the entire playthrough in order to be leveled up enough to get through the late part of the game.  That is why I will not end up finishing the game.  I could either walk around and fight everyone I see for eight hours straight to level up or just move on with my life.  I will continue to play arcade mode and online.  Probably will not buy any DLC unless they give a lot more characters.

metacritic,MEGAMC3,street-fighter-6,"An absolute predatory garbage game. Horrible practices like overpriced microtransactions and sellout cheap crossover content. On top of those horrible practices almost every other feature that is vital to making a game good had gone downhill in the game since launch. This game is just another one of many other modern FG that has exposed how shallow, exploitive, and just plain awful it really is after the initial honeymoon phase. There is no different character playstyles, player expression, or true skill involved anymore. Just braindead mashing, unskilled 50/50 guessing constantly, boring overly long way too powerful corner carry combos, and aggressive overbearing BS system mechanics that make every characters diverse move-set useless. These things make the whole game feel the same and cheap like a player did not earn their win through skill at all. This caters to casuals and people that don't give a **** about competitive FG. Capcom and the devs have shown their awful true colors like most other modern FG and their company's behind them. They have all shown the awful state FG are in today compared to what FG used to be. The supposed ""new era"" of FG is an absolute joke and this game is a prime example of that. It all makes the future of FG look like garbage.",0,10

metacritic,PEPSIMAN9367,street-fighter-6,Sf6 is a great game. When I first heard about modern controls I was very scared but they somehow made it so balanced. The 20 percent less damage for auto specials doesn’t make it feel like your throwing pillows at the opponent but its also not so little that people on classic feel like they are getting with a semi truck. You can still also perform the regular motion inputs for special moves on modern and when you play modern you lose access to some of your kit to if you play on modern. Btw this is coming from a person who has a classic Ken in plat 5 and a modern Luke in diamond 2 Maximillian dood said it best the people who are complaining about modern are the people hardstuck in silver. The only reason it is not a 10/10 I think world tour could’ve had a little more effort. Highly recommend this game even if you are not a fighting game veterans= still so fun.,9,10

However, the game is still fun and I'm having a blast even though it feels a bit ""slow"" and I don't really like some of the design choices. I might switch to Tekken 8 when I get my hands on it since I've never had problems with the inputs in Tekken 7 (only problems with the netcode) and I like to be competitive in these more popular FGs.

The adventure mode is average and the only reason to play single player modes is to get better at the online game.

In short, this is a game for Street Fighter fans, so it is unlikely that it will appeal to newcomers, especially those like me who wants to have fun playing the game and enjoy it. I got nothing. Everyone who has played, knows that the main menu of the game (by the way, I praise it because it is really beautiful, original and simple) is divided into three parts. The first is ""World Tour"", to be honest I expected the map to be bigger than my stingy uncle's pocket, but this is far from the biggest problem in this mode. Here! Simply! Very! Boring! Characters who are supposed to inspire or evoke different emotions are just wax figures who don't even always open their mouths during their phrases (by the way, there is no voice acting in the gameplay, so take your glasses, because you will have to read white text in the game of 2023). Rewards are terrible and not worth the time and nerves.  Barely enduring this story, I went to the second menu section ""Battle Hub"". This is the most ordinary room with players who can run around, play in the classic mode, ""Extreme Battle"", ""Avatar Battle"" and tournaments that do not take place every day and for the first 2 months did not exist in the game at all. For trophies, i've played it a few times and it's just unbalanced crap! Players of the rank - ""Bronze"", ""Iron"" and ""Rookie"" in the first rounds face professionals such as ""Platinum"" and ""Master"", it is completely unfair to the newbies! Of course, there were tournaments for the same ranks, but where are they now? Why do mice have to fight tigers and dragons? In other words, it's just game suicide. I checked all the tournaments in which I participated and of course all pairs of participants! Instead of a ""Master""/""Master"" battle,  I always saw ""Iron""/""Master"", ""Rokie""/""Diamond"" etc. 
Well, the last section in the menu is ""Fighting Grounds"". Believe it or not, everything here is the same as in ""Battle Hub"" except for unfair tournaments. In addition, here you can find: ""Training"", ""Combo Trials"", ""Character Guide"", ""Arcade"" and multiplayer, where after 10 battles you get the ranks that were written about above. If you like to wait for an opponent for a hell of a time, and then after victory they can run away like the last rats, then this mode is for you. That's all! I tried everything, even got every possible prize that is in the game. You ask me why I bothered playing this game? Maybe just a masochist who evaluates the game only after absolute completion. Summarizing all of the above, we can conclude that if you are an average player, you will not spend a lot of time in the game, especially since there is practically nothing to do in it.",5,10

metacritic,JWil,street-fighter-6,"Street Fighter 6 is amazing. This is a much better entry than SF5 was. New characters are introduced and you can even see originals still around. There is World Tour Mode, an Online gathering spot which I haven’t tried due to no internet connection where I’m currently at, and a normal 2 round match mode where you fight 2 rounds against fighters you know and love.       The World Tour as my favorite because you get to create your own character and travel around the world. The fighters you come across are your masters and have a level rank with them. You can learn their moves and supers if you train hard enough bough with each.      Don’t fret though if you have a style you like and can’t part with it you can transfer those experience points to a master who needs it and level them up as well. It’s like one big Street Fighter RPG which I absolutely love. As you know I love all kinds of RPG’s and have a special place in my heart for RPG fighters such as this.       It all started back on Nintendo 64 with a game called Flying Dragon, but that’s another story for another day. You follow the story by doing missions in the starting city. You find out that’s the same city from Final Fight where they have a memorial to Haggar the Mayor who helped fight to rid the city of gangs and hoodlums.      It would make sense, fighting is in these peoples DNA so you can literally fight everyone you see on the street from big buff dudes to old ladies. It’s kind of funny but it works very well with THIS particular city. More areas unlock later on.      It’s interesting how the characters are introduced in the story. I haven’t fully seen everything the story has to offer but I’m in my 70’s when it comes to levels. The story mode kind of keeps going. I did play a normal match and it appears for Ryu the new character Luke is the last boss.      He’s the featured character on the game so him being the next up and coming guy it’s natural he’d be looking for the legend Ryu. Anyway I don’t want to say much else.      The game is what you’d expect from a Street fighter game. Characters are stylish, handsome and lovely respectively. Beautiful visuals that are a pleasure to see.      My only gripe about the game was while it was downloading Capcom seems to think I want to see the beginning intro movie all the time with the very feminine male character hosting the fighting event. I mean it’s different but I’d rather not see it more than once. Also I was surprised to see the lack of characters in the story and world tour mode.       Other than that I have no complaints about it and I’m sure you’ll love it. SF6 it’s. 9 out of 10 for me. Almost perfect. Happy gaming and enjoy my friends!",9,10

metacritic,Fj_Lohner,street-fighter-6,"Un gran juego con el que me lo he pasado en grande, me encanta el nuevo diseño de los personajes antiguos y el de los nuevos personajes, la jugabilidad es rápida, bastante técnica y está llena de posibilidades.

El modo World Tour me ha hecho involucrarme con cada uno de los luchadores y aprendido bastante de ellos (sus movimientos, estilo de lucha y su historia), aunque quizá peca bastante de repetitivo, cosa que no ha sido problema para hacerlo al 100%.

El modo Battle Hub es un acierto para interactuar con otros luchadores y ponerte a prueba contra ellos, un acierto muy grande las peleas de avatares, con el que cogeremos nuestro avatar del modo historia para batirnos con los demás jugadores.

Y el modo clásico vendría a ser el Fighting Ground, en el que podremos completar la partida de todos los personajes, entrenar con ellos sus combos y gestionar desde ahí los combates igualados o amistoso para batirnos con otros luchadores.

No me ha gustado que pongan trofeos respecto a torneos, cuando no he visto torneo alguno, evitando así que me haga el platino, pero podré superarlo.

Recomendable.",9,10
metacritic,TrentDarko,street-fighter-6,"Street Fight 6 is a game that even non-fighting game fans can find enjoyable. While I may not be the best at fighting games, I still had a blast playing this one. My focus for this review is on the World Tour mode, which offers an entertaining albeit campy story. It takes us on a journey through Metro City and other parts of the world like London, though the locations outside of Metro City are not as expansive. Despite that, the World Tour mode adds a fun element to the game and is definitely worth exploring.

The graphics in Street Fight 6 are pretty solid, capturing the essence of the Street Fighter series. While they may not be groundbreaking, fans of the franchise will appreciate the familiar visual style. One major highlight of the game is its extensive roster, featuring both current and upcoming characters through the season pass. This adds a significant amount of variety and excitement to the gameplay experience.

In conclusion, Street Fight 6 is a fun and enjoyable game, even for those who aren't typically fans of fighting games. The World Tour mode offers an entertaining story, and while the graphics may not be groundbreaking, they still capture the essence of the Street Fighter series. The diverse roster of characters, both current and upcoming, adds a great deal of value to the game. Overall, it's definitely worth checking out for fans and newcomers alike.",9,10

metacritic,SupermanBatman,street-fighter-6,"I purchased this game based on the high critic scores, but I wish I would have paid more attention to user reviews. Here's some pros and cons:

Pros:

1. The graphics look very good on PS5 and have the same vibrant, fun and colourful look of previous SF games.

2. The open world is good for what it is, especially for a fighting game and Capcom needs to be commended for this.

Cons:

1. Learning curves are pretty much now pointless since it offers no advantages for mastering skills since newbies can button mash there way to a victory. Akin to a pub fighter beating up a kung fu master.

2. The fluidity and smoothness of previous games is gone. The fighting is sluggish and often feels like you're playing underwater.

3. The game has no edge and has none of the fun over-the-top scenes. Characters are extremely vanilla and bland.

4. The host Eternity is cringe, corny and repugnant to look at. Obviously included to tick some checkbox as is the removal of male and female identities. For this reason I wouldn't recommend this game to people who still hold traditional (i.e. normal) values.",2,10

metacritic,NoseGuy,street-fighter-6,"Street Fighter 6 had one of the best launches in fighting game history and two months later the game still surprises me with its quality. I have been playing fighting games since I was 9 and I've always struggled to find a fighting game that maintained my interest playing online and with Street Fighter 6 I've finally found what I was looking for. The gameplay is simple enough to get a grasp on for newer players (even classic controls has easier inputs for special moves) and leaves enough decision making to keep mid to high level players interested. Seriously I have put more than forty hours into ranked and I learn something every game I play. Most fighting games cannot say the same. On top of that the netcode is amazing. Those who complain about it are probably using Wi-Fi because you can have matches across the globe with very little problems.

In terms of single player this game definitely satisfies. Usually fighting games struggle with justifying a $60 price tag which is why the launch of SFV was so horrible. Capcom needed to make sure with SF6 that there was enough single player content to rival a NetherRealm game, and they did not disappoint. Word Tour mode isn't perfect, but its one of the best single player modes I've seen come out of fighting games especially compared to the grindy towers found in recent MK games. Creating your own fighter will never not be cool and the conversations between the player and the characters can be pretty hilarious.

Battle Hub is another mode that SF6 introduces and its pretty good. Ark System Works have attempted to do this kind of thing with Dragon Ball Fighterz and Guilty Gear, but I'd argue that they mediocre compared to Battle Hub. There's a couple of fun things you can do in this mode and I hope Capcom keep adding to it in the future because it has so much potential.

Street Fighter 6 also has a new sense of identify that SF hasn't had in years. The music, cutscenes, and presentation all build an atmosphere that nails what they were trying to accomplish.

I do have some some complaints. Matchmaking in ranked is region locked which **** especially for Masters players, the endgame of world tour mode is a little lack luster, and there are a couple more small issues.

Overall Street Fighter is back and I hope the DLC is as good as the base game.",10,10
metacritic,Xenomorph_kills,street-fighter-6,My first SF ever. I never thought i would enjoy well known advanced fighting game as much as i have with this. The multiple modes make it refreshing and alows the game to not become stale after many weeks of playing. The quick load times but it so easy to go from boot up screen to a training/match in less than a minute. The character designed are super flashy and fun to look at. The only issue would be some matchmaking issues and the need to add a form of microtransaction to the game. I am having so much fun and i am glad to now be apart of the SF fandom.,9,10
metacritic,freemanlouis,street-fighter-6,"The hardest part about this game is deciding what to do next.  The amount of enjoyable, engaging and rewarding content is amazing.  From World Tour antics and level grinding, to meeting nice players from across the globe in battle hub, its a fun time.  The number one feature of SF6 is that every fight seems fair.  For every overpowered special or tricky drive guage move their is a counter that is readily available.

I've personally have had a great experience playing ranked matches online with 97% of the time matches running smoothly over various internet connection types.  I have had very few rage quitters and the majority of opponents will rematch.  Friend request and replays working very well and easy to use as well.

I found myself playing more World Tour than I expected because I enjoyed unlocking more of the story of the SF characters.  The amount of grind to unlock outfits is my only complaint.

The game cabinet with retro games is one of my favorite small touches that keeps me coming back to Battle Hub.  As long as you don't take Avatar battles to seriously they are a great time as well.",9,10

Never felt satisfying landing it, as it leads to a big combo all because I got lucky and used it during my opponents move. Never touched world tour as it seemed more of a tutorial for newer players.

Si bien siempre fui un fanático de Street Fighter desde el 2 hasta el 5, probé Tekken 3 y Tekken 7 en el pasado, este último título ha cambiado por completo mi perspectiva. De hecho, dejé de lado Street Fighter 6 después de unas pocas horas, porque lo que Tekken 8 ofrece supera con creces todo lo que me brindaba el juego de Capcom en cuanto a gráficos, mecánicas y jugabilidad. Este juego es, sin duda, una obra maestra. La emoción del combate está presente en cada enfrentamiento, y la calidad gráfica es impresionante, llevando la franquicia a un nuevo nivel. Los personajes, que ya eran icónicos, siguen siendo el alma del juego, pero con una profundidad y detalles que hacen que cada pelea sea única. Tekken 8 no solo se siente más grande, más fuerte y mejor que sus predecesores, sino que también ofrece una experiencia más accesible y emocionante para los jugadores de todos los niveles. La cantidad de contenido es sobresaliente, y la narrativa también es muy buena, con una historia épica que mantiene a los jugadores enganchados. Además, la jugabilidad fluye de manera impecable, lo que hace que este título se convierta en uno de los mejores juegos de lucha de todos los tiempos.

The movement feels clunky and outdated compared to other fighting games, and the combo system is unnecessarily complicated, making it frustrating to learn.

The story mode tries too hard to be serious but ends up feeling overdramatic and boring. Even the online experience is a mess with its lag and matchmaking issues.

metacritic,dan1230,tekken-8,"They broke our precious game. They turned it into Mortal Kombat and Street Fighter. The decision to add more rage mechanics doesn't add to the game. The precision and simplicity are what created this Tekken community. It was the only modern fighting game that emphasized perfectionism and balance between characters, and now they've turned it into a game where the first one to enter the special attack animation will probably win. The way the fight stops so the player can perform the dance and enter a hit worth 50% HP, even when the other player attacks with a low frame - a simple press of R1 breaks the rhythm and the sequence of the fight. And for dessert they decided to release the game again with paid characters Ptw , which is certainly cheeky when not all the characters in Tekken 7 have been released to this day. In conclusion, I doubt this game's ability to create the community that was in its predecessors.",6,10
metacritic,KensUppercut,tekken-8,"An absolutely worthy successor to Tekken 7, Tekken 8 gets you ready for the next battle! 

I have a generally favorable view of Tekken 8. Full disclosure, Tekken is definitely my favorite fighting game franchise. That being said there is an awful lot to love about this newest entry in the second franchise, however a few publisher overreaches prevent this from becoming a perfect sequel to Tekken 7. 

From graphics to gameplay Tekken 8 is an amazing and alluring site to behold. The Tekken team have really brought their a game and bringing The saga of the Mishima's to a close. 

There are a ton of excellent features such as a robust and frantic story mode. The ability to jump into a replay of a fight you played to try and figure out if you could have played a match differently from the moment of impact. Character customization is also back albeit seemingly scaled back a little. And Tekken ball makes a triumphant return as well. 

There is a brand new mode that serves as a tutorial for the online mode getting players adjusted to what it's like to fight online. Arcade quest is a fun quirky mode that allows you to create an online avatar and simulate the old days of going to an arcade putting your quarter up and battling people in an arcade setting.  It's definitely a fun addition that's not quite perfect but I'm hoping gets a lot of adjustments and add-ons in the future. 

The combat system has been retooled and refined and luckily not to the detriment of casual or pro gamers. Whether you want to dedicate 8 hours or 80 hours there is something here for you. Just want to play with your friends after work? Try simplified controls. These will allow you or your friends to string together combos and rage arts with simplified button controls simply by pressing L1 on your PlayStation controller. Well this won't enable you to win any tournaments, you will be more than able to play some matches with your friends of intermediate skill.

However my main gripes with Tekken 8 come from the battle pass and aggressive marketing. Just loading in to Tekken 8 to play versus mode routes you through the online store first and shows you any available DLC characters you don't have yet. Also there are considerable character customization elements locked behind the battle pass and must be obtained with premium currency. Premium currency that as per the usual cannot be obtained just to get the one thing you want but always leaves you with slightly more currency but not enough to afford anything completely. These honestly are the only reasons that prevent me from strongly recommending Tekken 8 to everybody I know. 

However if someone is able to not be tempted by some of the more aggressive marketing, Tekken 8 definitely has something for everyone.",8,10

All their unstoppable attacks, their ""magic"" and their **** goes against the logic of this saga, and completelly kills the gameplay. Second, they steal main, iconic characters like Heihachi, Eddie or Lei, just to make people pay for them. Heihachi has been in the saga since the first game, for gods sake. Lei since the second, Eddie since the third. And many more. This is not an addition to the saga as a DLC, like if they were adding a random character from other franchise, it's just the contrary.

metacritic,overlord23,tekken-8,"Tekken 8 offers an exciting and deeply engaging experience for fans of the long-running fighting game franchise. The game introduces several key features that refine and expand its gameplay while maintaining the core mechanics that have made Tekken a staple in the fighting game **** of the standout features in Tekken 8 is the new Heat System, which introduces an aggressive new dynamic to combat. When activated, Heat powers up characters, adding new abilities, moves, and perks, such as chip damage and devastating finishers. This encourages players to take a more aggressive approach during matches, shifting the balance away from defense-oriented play. The system is different for each character, making it a strategic tool for both new and experienced players​. The game also introduces a new control scheme, Special Style, designed to make the game more accessible to newcomers by simplifying combo execution. However, this system comes with limitations, as it doesn’t provide the depth needed for high-level competitive play. It's ideal for story mode or casual players, but serious fighters will need to rely on the more traditional input methods to master the game​. Another notable addition is the Arcade Quest, a mode that allows players to travel the world and compete in virtual arcade tournaments. This provides a fun and rewarding single-player experience, with battles against AI ghosts—AI opponents that mimic the fighting styles of actual players. The mode’s integration of real player data adds an interesting twist and makes for more challenging and varied AI opponents. Overall, Tekken 8 builds upon the legacy of the series, offering improvements in accessibility, strategy, and gameplay modes. The Heat System and revamped practice tools make it both a challenge for veterans and an exciting entry for newcomers.

There's no skill anymore to have to master the game, just button smashing using moves that completely kills the 3rd dimension of the game.

Furthermore, the only focus of the Tekken team now is to get the game as dump as possible to sell copies, and adding useless costumes as dlc. No intention to release a satisfying balance patch that fixes the infinite amount of cheap and game-breaking moves.

The game is great and all (heat mode, rage mode, combos, no move list, easy play, nice graphics, vibrant colors, landscape scenes, music,  etc.) **** two point deduction is for the lack of story interest. I’ve been in love with Jin since he was introduced in Tekken 3. Why hasn’t Harada given Jin a woman who Jin actually LIKES and WANT to be with? I don’t know but Harada needs to redeem himself. The story line in the game gets a little boring if the creators don’t spice it up with a little bit of romance to keep the game interesting to play. Harada owe Jin a new girlfriend in Tekken 9. I would love to see Jin kiss a new women in Tekken 9 and throw Xiaoyu under the bus. Let’s face the facts, Jin is NOT interested in Xiaoyu so why do they keep pairing them both together in the game? I don’t know but they are clearly UNFIT for each other. Come on……Give my man Jin a new woman. TEKKEN 9 would be sooo HOT and ALLURING to play if the developers, simply introduce a new female fighter for Jin. A women who Jin is actually interested in. Since he lost his devil gene in T8.

Its 80% visuals 20% gameplay. In addition the gameplay is so easy and dumbed down that it feels like the game is helping me cheat.

Technically Tekken 8 is a great fighter, it looks fantastic with some real effort put into the story mode cinematics and blend with the gameplay.  It's once you get past these things that Tekken 8 starts to not look so great, character customization is kind of terrible with anything worthwhile behind a paywall and not to mention the mtx shop that they decided to not mention during the build up towards the game being released which seemed very deliberate and predatory to cash in on great preorder sales.  It is a shame that such a well constructed game could also be such a disappointment which gets pretty boring rather quickly once you've done the arcade story and tire of just playing online matches over and over again.

I was holding off to buy because of possible add-ons post review/release, such as the battle pass & store (just don't pre-order anything ever). Of course they dropped and has already been a deterrent along with the price of the base game, let alone the DLC (not including the MTX which just continues to add to the cost).

I can get past some of the character imbalances as those are often addressed, however, the recent slaughtering of youtube channels over fan created content I simply can't get behind. If it weren't for the unreasonable actions of Bandi/Namco, I probably wouldn't be here writing this review. People have lost years of work and content they've diligently created.

metacritic,MEGAMC3,tekken-8,"An absolute predatory garbage game. The POS devs and Bandai had the nerve to hide scummy predatory practices like micro transactions and a battle pass at launch just to avoid bad reviews. On top of those horrible practices almost every other feature that is vital to making a game good had gone downhill in the game since launch. This game is just another one of many other modern FG that has exposed how shallow, exploitive, and just plain awful it really is after the initial honeymoon phase. There is no different character playstyles, player expression, or true skill involved anymore. Just braindead mashing, unskilled 50/50 guessing constantly, boring overly long way too powerful corner carry combos, and aggressive overbearing BS system mechanics that make every characters diverse move-set useless. These things make the whole game feel the same and cheap like a player did not earn their win through skill at all. This caters to casuals and people that don't give a **** about competitive FG. Bandai and the devs have shown their awful true colors like most other modern FG and their company's behind them. They have all shown the awful state FG are in today compared to what FG used to be.

Characters with such a huge effect on gameplay should not be put behind a paywall, especially when the game is being aggressively monetized in other ways.

metacritic,HaloBlues,stardew-valley,"The graphics are cute, consistent, and charming. The character designs are varied and fitting for their personalities. The town is lovely and I'd move there in a heartbeat if I wasn't too damn lazy to put up with countryside. When it comes to the characters, there's a broad range of personalities and outlooks -- they're all pretty likeable to me, including less popular characters like Demetrius and Clint. Personal favourite is Sebastian, and I'll always have a soft spot for Leah who was my first romance route. Linus is endearing, too. Dialogue can get pretty repetitive. As someone usually aiming to talk to characters every day to build my relationships with them, I run into repeated chunks of dialogue within an in-game week, which is a pretty big deal when you can only have one individual conversation with each character per day, and has me losing motivation to check in with everyone. The storyline is far more character-driven than story-driven. Each major NPC has their own sort of mini character arc, especially if you romance them, and there are small storylines such as the Joja Mart vs. Community Center struggle, but ultimately you won't be playing this for any in-depth story. It's a game about the characters and about building your farm up from the ground. Gameplay is completely fine for what it is. I'm not a fan of the time limit, it feels like I barely have time to do anything before the day is over and I'm forced to sprint back to the house lest I collapse and pass out on the ground on the dot at 2AM and go into the next day with an energy level hit. It makes it hard to enjoy the game and its aesthetics as you play because you feel like you're rushing around and shoving all your objectives in before shops close and you get **** has up to four-player co-op. I've played it with one other player, but I do want to try it with a full game sometime. The co-op is fun, everyone gets their own relationships with NPCs, can marry characters, do all the usual stuff around town, etc. You share a farm, but other players get their own little guest houses on the land. As surprising as it might be with the high rating and the general praise, **** Valley really isn't subjectively for me. I'm not a fan of games where you have to live out every day doing tasks, where you're dropped into the game with little hand-holding and left to come up with your own objectives (you'll probably need to do some Googling first playthrough, because the game Will Not explain how to do anything to you), the time limit is stressful, the repetitive dialogue is tiring, and I've never been able to get past the second season in any solo game I've tried. And yet it's so damn endearing and charming that I can't justify giving it any less. The fact that this game was made by one guy - yeah, I know, everyone harps on about that in their reviews, but that **** is MIND-blowing. I almost want to give it five stars for that fact alone, because one person creating everything in this game is such a struggle to comprehend.

metacritic,MidTakes4Me,stardew-valley,Stadew valley is a game you can keep coming back to thinking you need something to relax with.

YOU personalize your experience, you could only play to romance, or to make money,go to the mine, discover the secrets, this game has literally so much to offer. And when you're done ? INSANE mod community that gives content that is as long if not longer than the actual game. **** is cozy, but it can also be stressful. It'll make you feel. However it is a specific type of rinse and repeat gameplay that is not meant for every player.

Excellent support and attention by the community.(Updates I'd like to see)(PVP - update)A few days ago I finished terraria completely, and I thought that some things still need to be filled in, what if it was possible to invade other players' worlds? Yes, this reminds us of some franchise that we have in the industry, but it wasn't bad at all, in fact it even added something to the pvp mode of the game, of course the combat in that aspect could change, but it would be fun.(Industrial Update)I think the game should have a slower and more industrial progression, despite being a fantasy RPG game.(World)When we get to the ocean we might not have a limited world and need a boat to sail to other islands, that would also be quite interesting.",8,10

metacritic,Onebit,terraria,"Terraria, a popular sandbox adventure game, offers a charming and engaging experience that combines exploration, crafting, and combat. With its vast world, diverse gameplay mechanics, and a myriad of content to discover, Terraria has garnered a dedicated fanbase and provides hours of enjoyable **** of the standout features of Terraria is its expansive and procedurally generated world. Players are dropped into a pixelated, 2D environment filled with towering mountains, deep underground caverns, and vibrant biomes. The sense of exploration is immense as players uncover hidden treasures, encounter challenging enemies, and stumble upon rare resources. The world of Terraria feels alive and full of secrets, creating a constant sense of wonder and excitement.Terraria's gameplay mechanics are a strong aspect of the game. The ability to mine resources and craft items is a significant focus, allowing players to build structures, weapons, and armor to aid in their adventures. The variety of materials, equipment, and weapons available ensures that each playthrough can feel unique, fostering a sense of progression and accomplishment. Additionally, the combat system is fast-paced and satisfying, with challenging boss battles that provide a rewarding sense of achievement.Another appealing aspect of Terraria is its multiplayer functionality. Playing with friends or joining community servers enhances the experience, allowing for cooperative building projects, exciting boss battles, and memorable adventures. The social aspect of Terraria adds an extra layer of enjoyment and provides opportunities for collaboration and **** retro-inspired graphics and charming soundtrack of Terraria contribute to its overall appeal. The pixel art style is visually appealing and creates a nostalgic atmosphere that resonates with players. The soundtrack, composed of catchy tunes and ambient melodies, complements the gameplay and adds to the immersive experience.However, Terraria is not without its shortcomings. The game's learning curve can be steep for newcomers, as it does not provide much guidance or tutorials. This can lead to initial confusion and frustration until players grasp the mechanics and objectives.

What really ups this is the official game called TModLoader, which is just terraria except it officially supports mods. And the mods for Terraria are insane. Just completely bonkers. Some of the most fun I've had in a game.

It doesn't quite match Minecraft's extensive sandboxing options, a good portion of the bosses are basically big balls of health that charge at you sometimes, and you need to learn everything through guides and wikis, which is quite hard for a new player. I will say that the weapons are creative, the class system is pretty cool, and the Calamity mod through Tmodloader significantly enhances the gameplay and bosses.

metacritic,TheQuietGamer,terraria,"While perhaps not the best way to experience due to some issues with the controls, Terraria is still an excellent and worthwhile source of player-driven fun. Calling it a 2d Minecraft is arguably the best way to describe, however by doing so you are selling the game short. Terraria takes the core mechanics of Minecraft and expands upon them is so many ways.

This open-world sandbox is yours to do whatever you want in. It's got a big emphasis on combat. With plenty of crazy weapons to craft, a wealth of enemy types, and even boss battles if you are looking for a side-scrolling action game with a great RPG feel then this is for you. The combat is a little awkward due to the controls and overall execution, but the game gives you plenty of reasons to hunt down those monsters anyway.

Of course if monster-slaying isn't your thing you can just focus on exploring and resource gathering to build that awesome mansion you want. That's really the beauty of Terraria. It's up to you how you play it.

To make things better you can even bring friends along. With four-player local co-op and up to eight players online, it's an awesome co-op experience with plenty to offer everyone in your group. The couch co-op portion suffers a bit due to the small size of the spilt screens obscuring some things, but the co-op is still strong with this one.

It's a game that basically let's you do whatever you want. It's up to you how you play it and there are plenty of options to ensure that whatever play style you choose is available. When you consider that you can even bring friends along and the whole thing is made even better. It's worth putting up with the controls and getting past the initial learning curve to discover the real joys it had to offer. Terraria is just a great game no matter what you are looking for.",8,10

The content goes far beyond that of minecraft. You can do so many things, fight all the bosses, craft tons of amazing items, go spelunking, try and destroy your friends with the gear you've collected, house and trade with the NPC's for new items, and the list goes on. Terraria is LITERALLY endless fun.",10,10

metacritic,DeathStreak546,terraria,"When i first heard of Terraria on the Xbox 360, i was thinking it was going to be something like a side-scrolling Minecraft, but it is much more. So many different things to do, let me name them off for you: Building houses for your people to live it, huge/awesome boss battles, so many different ores (the higher you get with more gear, the better and more difficult it gets),and so many more! I only rated it a 7 because the game didn't really get to me (i wasn't hooked like all my other friends were). But overall it's pretty impressive. (Oh, did i forget to mention, in this version there are quite some glitches to look out for, i'm mostly talking about multiplayer  WARNING: This game does come with same-console multiplayer ONLY if you have an HD-TV.",7,10
metacritic,bootyfarm,terraria,"Color scheme is all weird, controls are clunky, crafting glitches not showing all you can craft  low unstable FPS, having more then 4 people in a game is unplayable due to lag, when you do lag in multiplier you'll glitch into walls, 15$.....

metacritic,heegs,terraria,"While the controls don't carry over as well as they could from the PC to the XBLA port, Terraria is still the great 2D sandbox game people have come to know and love since its release on Steam. It's fun with friends or solo, and provides you with hours upon hours of mindless fun. If you're looking for a time-sink with a charming SNES feel along with one of the best video game soundtracks in recent memory, give Terraria a go. You might be quite happy you did.",8,10
metacritic,Rizaloo,terraria,"I did not have the pleasure of playing the PC version, but after spending around 30 or more hours with the xbox 360 version, I easily recommend it.  The controls are great but do take a bit of time to adjust to, and the game only gets more interesting as you continue to play.  It has an excellent way to not hold your hand, but instead, kill you to show you that you need to improve your armor, accessories or weapons.  There is just so much content, and the replay value is crazy since the world is all randomized.  For those who want a fun platformer with lots of RPG elements, random loot all over the place and a good emphasis on exploration, look no further.  30 hours so far, and I have not even unlocked hard mode, which gives you a whole new set of enemies, items, etc.  Amazing game.",9,10
metacritic,Fraz,terraria,"Terraria can keep you Engrossed for hours, making you want to explore, build and craft. I hate saying this but it is ""like"" a 2D Minecraft but also has some of it's own amazing features and content. The amount of different unique items will keep you exploring to find more.

When I played this game with my friends I would stay up for hours trying to find new weapons and tools to show off. I have put around a hundred of hours into it! I would highly recommend this game but is allot more funnier playing with people.",9,10
metacritic,Andrew4556,terraria,"In my opinion, this game is well worth the price of 1,200 Microsoft points. It is very addicting to find all of the amazing items around the randomly generated worlds. The bosses are quite difficult to kill alone but since it's on Xbox you can play with anyone. It's so fun to explore and find something that will just make you so proud of yourself that you found it. Then you can show it off to your friends. The game is just so fun to play overall but the graphics are at a low level but the content in the game goes over the reason for the good graphics. I highly recommend this game to anyone who likes Minecraft or exploration games.",9,10
metacritic,MuffAlorJr,terraria,"On the PC, i have exactly 347.46 hours of gameplay and still counting, i have maxed out everything quite literally and have made countless videos, and they made a great ""transfer on the xbox"" i am just a little mad that they didn't do anything really eye opening like adding new armor or something, but i guess it was fine because they were connecting console players to the most amazing world ever. It's worth your money and i hope they add dlc whether it's a new type of tree or armor i don't care.",10,10
metacritic,YetiChow,terraria,"I'm not going to deny that Terraria is a great game, and I won't dispute that for some people it fully deserves a ""10"" rating; however that is not the rating I feel comfortable giving this game. The reason is simple: to me, Terraria is not finished based on what the game promises and what it actually achieves. I don't mean the ""oh, we're updating it and brining in new content"" kind of unfinished (in fact I'm a staunch supporter of games which use this model to bring early releases to hungry fans); Terraria is unfinieshed in an abandoned kind of way. The features which are fully there are great, and there's a lot of great things to be said about the game, but unfortunately it falls short of what it could  and should  be. Of course, a lot of this is no fault of the developers; however I wouldn't reccomend Terraria to people unless they wanted a game to invest heavily into. If you want a game where you can build, explore or duke it out in PVP then Terraria offers all of that, however IMO none of these features are fully polished enough to warrant a high score.

That said, if the rumoured update does happen then my rating could well go up...",5,10
metacritic,Nyxx,terraria,"Terraria is oftentimes referred to as the ""2D Minecraft"", and left at that. While this is true, it's **** much more, and I feel this was why Minecraft radically changed it's game.

Graphics and Performance: Very clean 2D visuals, with virtually no slowdown, except in the most extreme of circumstances. The environments are very nice and detailed, and react to how you interact with them appropriately. The only complain I have are the animations: There's hardly any on the monsters, most of them may as well be still images.

Sound: Relaxing music is a given, but the sound effects are pretty good. All the enemies have their own sound effects, and your weapons make correct sounds, too. If you have a flaming greatsword, you can hear the flames crackling off the blade as you swing.

Control: Overall, it's okay. Jumping can be a bit annoying until you get used to it, but once you get that down, you'll be gathering materials and chopping down monsters like a pro.

Gameplay: Compared to Minecraft, the basics remain the same: Take squares to put on top of other squares in order to build things, gather materials to craft items and gear in a randomly generated world, repeat ad-nausium. That hasn't changed. What has changed is about everything else.

Terraria plays like an Action RPG more than a sandbox game. There is a wide variety of enemies to fight, treasure chests to discover containing rare items, and even giant bosses to take down for rare materials and gear! Unlike Minecraft, where combat feels like an afterthought, it was very much thought of here.

The amount of gear in the game is just insane: Jet boots, grappling hooks, machine guns, speed boosters, meteor-summoning swords...just to name a few! It always feels like there's always something new to find and explore.

It actually reminds me of an old PS2 game I liked, called Dark Cloud. You can build up your town, and as you do, you summon NPCs to live there. These NPCs can heal your wounds, sell you gear and items, or provide helpful advice. The ""town building"" aspect gives you a motivation to actually build things as opposed to, ""build it...just 'cause you can"".

Not that there's a shortage of things to build. All kinds of decorations and crazy things you can set up, it's as diverse as the gear you can craft!

There are a few problems, though. The beginning of the game can be absolutely miserable. Once you go underground, you'll find yourself being murdered by enemies you stand no chance against, struggling to survive with your most basic of equipment. You'll fall down a horrible pit, and immediately die. You may run right into the Corruption right into the beginning of the game, and, again, die.

What is the Corruption? It's bad stuff. It slowly spreads around the world, bringing with it rather powerful enemies, deep pits, and thorns to impede your progress. It is interesting how it slowly spreads throughout the world, but running into it early is a death sentence.

This is a game you need to devote a lot of time into. It's not like Minecraft, where you can suddenly start building random stuff, dig a bit, and be like, ""Oh, I found Diamond"" and suddenly be godlike. You need a LOT of items in order to reach that stage, and this will take a lot of trial and error. If you aren't willing, or able, to invest a lot of time in this game (It takes hours just to start getting beyond the early-level caves), this may not be for you.

If you like building things, which this game does well, it, still, may not be for you. Minecraft has with it wayyy more building options, and, of course, it's in a 3D environment. This makes it way better if all you want to do is build structures, as you both have more to work with, and more in the way of options, such as crazy electronic devices.

However, if an action-packed time sink is what you're after, Terraria is a good jack-of-all-trades. It does a lot of things, and is a master of none of them, but it's a pretty solid experience overall. So much to explore and build, you'll spend weeks, STILL finding things about your first world that you didn't even know about, yet!

Try before you buy, but it really depends on what you like more: Combat and exploration, or building and exploration.",8,10

metacritic,eva3si0n,dead-space-3,"Dead Space ruined part 3, but rather EA's desire to make an atmospheric horror cooperative shooter from the 3rd person. Dead Space 3 has squandered all its atmosphere. The plot, although trying to reveal the original source of all events, does it terribly. The gameplay in general was originally made for a cooperative, which contradicts the entire target audience. Because of this, some story clips generally roll into cringe. The gameplay has also degraded a lot and has become more shooter. And given that the 3rd part came out under the decline of the console generation, the Xbox360/PS3 power was no longer enough to pull it out. Ultimately, we got mostly a mediocre product as part of the Dead Space series. But in general, as an independent game, Dead Space 3 is no longer bad. You understand this especially well after 10+ years, when you watch how the games have degraded. Dead Space 3 is more pleasant to play than the conditional The Callisto Protocol. It was first held in 2024 on the Xbox 360 and had fun. Just a good game that was ruined by EA's greed.",7,10
metacritic,Alex_Ozzy008,dead-space-3,"This is a poor sequel, but a decent action game. Unlike the first two, this is NOT survival horror. Instead, it is a third-person shooter comparable to ""Lost Planet"" and ""Gears of War"". Sadly, ""Dead Space 3"" is filled with recycled enemy types and boring boss fights. While I appreciate the lengthy campaign and sub-missions, the gameplay does get repetitive. Playing in co-op adds additional missions and story elements. Also, finishing ""Space 3"" unlocks extra bonus content including a ""Classic"" mode. Overall, I would rate this with a 7.3 out of 10.",7,10

metacritic,IlusiveZoidberg,dead-space-3,"What a disappointment.  Take one of my new favorite horror series, and turn it into a co-op Gears of War with microtransactions.
   There's not much nice I can say about this game. The environment and enemy design I decent I guess, and the side quest feature adds appreciated lore. Unfortunately, this military shooter has nothing scary about it.  This game is incredibly easy on even hard difficulties, sapping all tension and fear from the monsters, and the modding system only makes it worse. You can make ridiculously unbalanced weapons, I beat Dead Space 3 on the hardest difficulty using a single weapon the entire playthrough.
   And the story. It legitimately feel like the writers used the TV Tropes site as a reference.  Dead Space 1 had this problem, but 3 blows it up to the max, even ripping off other EA properties for their main antagonists.  And despite 3 having way more characters than any previous entry, not a single one am I left with positive impressions, even pre existing characters get ruined.

metacritic,Kio22,dead-space-3,"Dead Space 3 is a cautionary tale of what was to come in the gaming industry. This game has a lot of issues due to Electronics Art putting some of the best and most fun weapons in the game behind a pay wall in an in-game cash shop. These micro transactions were just the beginning of where the gaming industry was heading. Putting that aside Dead Space 3 is still a solid fun game to play but is lacking compared to the first two games. The gun play is different from the first two games in that you only get two weapons, but each has 2 changeable attachments for two ways to shoot on each gun. The enemies in the game also feel different in that shooting limbs is less important compared to how much damage your gun does which was a bad change from previous iterations. Another unnecessary change is the crafting system which just doesn't feel as fun or as important as the first two due to the lack of impact upgrading weapons has. The game play and crafting is still fun and solid but the changes just seem unnecessary and slightly off. The horror atmosphere is pretty much nonexistent in Dead Space 3 which kind of makes sense considering Isaac is a certified necromorph killer. The story and characters in this game are more of a step down from the previous two games, the characters have cheesy dumb interactions and deaths for the sake of just advancing the plot. The story is a little better than the characters its got an interesting plot that is horribly executed due to cheesy characters. The game is still solid and fun to play through, but it is a step down in every aspect from the first two and it has terrible micro transaction forced into the game by EA that ruin it further.",7,10

metacritic,Dperks,dead-space-3,Dead Space 3 is the weakest of the trilogy that's not to say it's a bad game of course but when compared to it's predecessors it comes up short. The biggest thing for me in this game was the introduction of crafting mechanics. Which I just wasn't interested in at all. While you can create some neat weapons and weapon combos they limit you to two guns and most of the weapons aren't effective or fun to use. And because of the crafting system now all guns use the same ammo type which meant that I ended up just making the guns I wanted by the half way point in the game and then just stuck to them because why waste time making other less effective weapons when I already have what I need to beat the game. The game is also a lot easier with all ammo being the same and healing items in such abundance I beet the game with dozens of extra health packs in storage. And the setting and atmosphere just don't feel nearly as scary or intense as they did in the previous games. And while I thought the story was fine I didn't care much for the human drama parts and all the side characters are basically worthless in this game. Although the Co op companion character I did like just because when playing single player he just shows up for cutscenes and they act like he's important when you barley even see him. I know I'm being critical and I still think the game is enjoyable. The actual gun play is still good learning the lore is interesting and visually the game still holds up fairly well. But the game feels like it was a product born out of a desire from higher ups for the the game to imitate what was popular at the time. Especially the crafting and co op additions but al least they didn't make it so when playing single player you had to have an AI companion follow you around.,6,10

metacritic,Stan_Osbourne,dead-space-3,"После полного прохождения Dead Space 3 , могу с уверенностью сказать. Нет, это не отвратительная игра и позорное окончание серии, и да, это всё еще такая же посредственная игра в моём понимании , как и все предыдущие игры серии, но обо всём по порядку.

По поводу самой игры - это было хорошее приключение. не идеальное,  но похоже на космическую сагу. Теперь игра стала больше похожа по духу на Gears of War. Возможность играть коо-пом, разные локации, множество экшн вставок и переходов, прям трилогией Гирь запахло в воздухе.  Но сам сюжет - полный бред, начиная с перепетий главных героев, их бредовых сюжетных линий, филлерных персонажей которые погибают в определённой точке повествования, дурацких диалогов, идиотских решений,  и прочее , прочее и прочее. Про этот никому не нужный любовный треугольник, безмозглость предательства и необоснованной мотивации главного антагониста - вообще молчу.

В геймплейном плане почти все изменения -ненужные.  Появились обычные люди стрелки и механика под борьбу с ними - укрытия, и приседания. Это почти не работает - механики под это не предназначены попросту, но и враги не сложные и умом не блещут. Патроны стали одни для ВСЕХ типов оружия, но это для кооперативного режима, так что неплохое решение. Но что меня , и многих других реально выбесило - это  модификации оружия. Это совершенно ненужное изменение. Оружие потеряло свою индивидуальность, да и рецепты к классическому и  новому оружию можно и так собрать или получить через ДЛС,..

Ах да, платные дополнение в сингловой игре, конечно. Мало того, что для боёв онлаин и сюжетного ДЛС нужно доплачивать валютой, так еще и чертежи и прочие плюшки можно купить отдельно. Это настолько подло и низко, что очень многие игроки это не схавали. Да и само оружие делать стало муторно. Магазины пропали, но на верстаках можно крафтить предметы с собираемых ресурсов...Эти механики с крафтом и ресурсами настолько НЕ для серии, что это и испортило всё впечатление.

А жаль.  В игре есть хорошие моменты, к примеру попытались в креатив в битве с боссами и битвами с ними - новые челенджи, использование новых трюков с кинезисом, много головоломок добавили. Простых, но больше чем одна простенькая во второй части.  Много моментов рассчитано под кооператив, чувствуется что в это будет интересно играть вдвоём. Много локаций, хорошая хоррор атмосфера, что на кораблях, что на ледяной планете. Экшн сцены стали лучше, но в целом, всё портит слабый сценарий , ужасная персонажка и слабая техническая сторона  и ужасная детализация персонажей и окружения.  Но как по мне -играть в этот хорорчик приятно, неплохое было приключение. И с друганом можно пройти - чем не кайф?)",7,10

metacritic,BlakDak666,dead-space-3,"Hearing a sequel for Dead Space 2 was very interesting for me because I thought it didn't need one. Much like the Alien and Aliens films, Dead Space 3 (Ali3ns) absolutely disappoints me that at best its mediocre and at worst is a terrible game that completely carves its ideas and world into pieces. Where to even begin on this conflicting game?

The graphics and HUD are still good. There is no denying the atmosphere in Dead Space 3 is it's strongest unit in the field. It might not have the power of the Ishimura or the Sprawl, but it does have creepy and interesting areas to see.

I also like the weapons, though some might cry foul on the game for being crappy on the way it handles the way you make them, but crafted weapons are not a bad thing. The first problem though of Dead Space 3 is the way those crafts work. You gather resources in the areas because unlike the previous games, it was an old colony that has long since been dead and lack the systems that modern ones do. On paper, crafting is brilliant and even goes as far making it a mode in DS3 where you only use materials to craft everything and anything instead of finding ammo and medkits. In practice, it is brought down by microtransactions. You can use scav bots to accrue resources by waiting around for your bot to return to your **** you can buy them with real money if you have no patience at all. This is so stupid and **** of the idea that it makes the concept disintegrate. Add to that mods that can overpower your weapons (complete with random chance loot boxes) and frames you can get by buying them in a gamble with real money, and you essentially pay to beat DS3 without even trying. But it gets worse.

YOU CAN REPLAY CHAPTERS.  In the previous games, you could not replay chapters, so being cautious and conserving ammo was paramount to survive. The fact you can go back to a chapter and farm it for ammo, health and resources is so lazy and infuriating that I almost gave up playing after the first few chapters on how unchallenged I was with the game. Who needs loot boxes and spend money when you can farm the same chapter over and over, memorize the enemies and scenarios and make no tension at all, ruining the formula of what 1 and 2 did in spades.

Co-op worsens this even more. The problem with co-op in survival games is that it breaks any tension the moment a player does something stupid and isnt as immersed as you. Carver as the second player just downplays everything the game brings with awkward camera pans of him when cutscenes happen. Difficulty **** when two strongly grindy players can just mow through everyone and even if they both go in blind will just use medpacks stored out the wazoo in their stations. If this doesnt sound still bad, it gets even worse.

The story is convoluted and mixed so much with lore and mythos that it bloats and collapses, much the same way the crew of idiots Isaac is with do when they crash land their ship into a icy planet and having no idea what the hell they are doing. Initially, the game starts off interesting and even has a great moment when a Unitologist heretic stays on top of a car and blows himself up, but the plot is so bogged down by answers that werent meant to be solved and just makes me scratch my head and go ""what was the whole point of that?""

The gameplay is solid, but level design is so dam lazy and crappy. It reuses far too many optional areas (in which they play out like mini dungeons) and recycles them too much for my taste. Carver's side missions unique to the co-op system is not that great and basically rehashes Isaac's exact plot with Nicole only without a son. The zero-g is like 2, but it loses its power after the crash on Tau Volantis. Initially it starts off great as Isaac (and Carver) can explore the entire area of the space above the planet. After that, there is limited amount of zero g on the ground. Considering the game series' own title has space in it, you would expect the devs to include more of this instead of planet exploration.

The death scenes are abruptly cut before any real horror comes, defeating much of what made 1 and 2 good. The ending was ambigous and for me dead neutral on overall quality, but Awakened rears its head and (if truly being canon to the game) is one of the worst DLCs I have ever played. The ending in that is so insulting and so revolting in garbage that it pains my heart to know if DS3 will ever get a sequel, because it was terrible and truly pointless for EVERYTHING the series was going for throughout.

Dead Space 3 is a mediocre and average game that painfully sacrifices crucial components to the previous two's success in some odd attempt to gain more people. Whether a new game is made is hard to say, but as a fan of the series it pains me say DS3 was absolute disappointment on every facet of its entirety.",5,10

If you have played the two others you'll probably like this one.
Okay it's a BIT less scary. But the atmosphere it's a its best, the crafting system is really great and
really make the exploration more interesting. Don't want to spoil anything but the news environments bring something really fresh in the Dead space universe.

metacritic,Spaceacer2012,dead-space-3,"Dead Space 3 is a special game for me. It was released on my birthday 2/5 and I took off work just to play it until my then girlfriend (now wife) got off work to go celebrate. I loved everything about the 1st 2 games, and this one didn't disappoint. My only gripe is the save system. Only 5 save slots and a new checkpoint system. I missed the old save stations. But! That's ok because the game was and is so insanely fun! It's a long game, yea not as scary as the 1st game but I was ok with that. Isaac is the best leading man in gaming. Ellie is smart and cool and they have good chemistry. One of the best looking games on 360. Fun yet intense story and crisp smooth gameplay mechanics. I love it and have played many times. I'd rather see a yearly Dead Space game than Call of Duty. It's fun single and co-op, never a dull moment. Here's hoping for #4!",10,10
metacritic,Darth_Kane,dead-space-3,"Seriously, what the hell happened to this series? Dead Space 1 was fresh, original, and still one of the best games of the generations. DS2 took the bigger-better-more approach, but in the end it was still a good game, even if it felt too linear and action-focused for me. But this, this is just a joke. It hurts me to see that a game with this good graphics is just dumbed down to a shooter. And not even a good one. The controls are way too clumsy for the action, which is OK for a horror game, but this is not one anymore. The story is so cheesy, that I had to skip all the cutscenes in order to not hurt my brain. I can't even describe the disappointment towards f*cking up something that I once loved like this. From what I've read, the game was a commercial failure, so I'm happy for that, but I still don't think that EA's self-proclaimed super producers learnt anything from this, so they will keep trying to make the same game over and over again, while putting it in a different box every time.",3,10
metacritic,Superstone,dead-space-3,"Dead Space 3 is a disappointment to anyone who played and enjoyed the first two games in the series.  There are several reasons why that I will explain in this review.  Within the first 30 seconds of the actual game, after a well-done and interesting explanation of the story so far,  Isaac Clarke (the protagonist of the first two games) is being manhandled by soldiers who have escaped from every other modern military shooter (but with the cool LED suits this game is known for) and have tasked this man with going to recover his ex-girlfriend that we overheard breaking up with him over voicemail.  From there, the game never lets up in letting you down.  The tension of having too little ammunition is gone.  Say hello to universal ammo clips! (Who got their **** Mass Effect systems in my Dead Space?  EA, the corporate embodiment of missing the point and hegemony, that's who, silly!  More on that later.)  Remember the body horror of seeing former human beings transformed into twisted masses of pulsating yellow flesh that you must dismember in the bloody, poorly-lit corridors of a spaceship-turned-tomb in the vacuum of space to really punch home the isolation?  That's gone too!  You'll start the game in a wide open environment where it seems a Church of Unitology (described in the game as a dangerous cult, like Scientology but with actual proof, however misguided, of their belief system) has somehow overrun the entire Earthgov so you now get to fight faceless soldiers!  You've never experienced banality like THIS in a Dead Space game!  Now, you will actually fight necromorphs because somehow they built a Marker the size of a **** without the government or anyone else noticing, but they are pushed towards you in a version of the earlier games' ""wave of enemies"" sequences that never really let up, so they get old, well, the second time you do one and realize that this is the game from now on.  Now that Unitology actually rivals Earthgov in reach and power, **** you might as well play Gears of War because that is now the story: aliens vs. Humans.  The new crafting system is... serviceable.  Honestly.  Getting new weapon blueprints and just making **** up is actually mildly enjoyable.  To offset that good thing, there are microtransactions that are **** abominations (you can pay for a faster little robot to gather stuff for you.  You literally pay EA to do something faster than you would in the game normally.  If this were competitive that's blatant pay-to-win **** but that has little to do with the direction of the game, that's just EA ****ting all over a good thing because they are not at the forefront of anything interesting, and if they are it's because they accidentally left a developer to their own devices for a little too long.  Like this franchise.   Almost nothing interesting was revealed in these last few paragraphs, but the complaints that I have are pretty much what appears throughout the game.  Sadly, this evolution is EAs forte though.  Have an interesting hit and then completely misunderstand that the reason it was a hit was because it was unique in its style, tone, content, whatever and thinking that if only there was a more streamlined (generic), polished (shiny-looking), interesting (action movie) way to tell that story, it would be great.  No, EA, that works for Madden (any sports games really)  and Battlefield fine because neither of those franchises have stories.  That was not the case of Dead Space... but it is now.  So congrats on your shiny, new corpse.  You **** it to death with your mediocrity.",5,10
metacritic,Mortacxo,dead-space-3,"This game was such a huge disappointment... The crappy crafting system, the **** enemy ai, the predictable ""take the long way"" situations, fetch quests similar to those in a repetitive and boring mmo in a single player ""horror"" story. The replacement of bad-ass Ellie to ""damsel in distress can't do **** myself anymore"" version of Ellie. Plot holes, the plot itself, micro-transactions to play a single-player game.

Everything adds up to a huge 1, 1 it gets for graphics, but would rather look at my computers wallpaper background of the Dead Space 1 or Dead Space 2 for 9 hours than play this **** anymore. Why not loop big buck bunny on repeat for 9 hours, still a better story than this crap.",1,10
metacritic,MoroseTroll,dead-space-3,"Dead Space 3, well, is a good enough game, although not as good as Dead Space 1&2. Due to the greedy EA's policy, the game has been split up on several DLCs. While many of those DLCs have just minor effect on the game play, the biggest one, the ""Awakening"", is a *direct sequel* to the main plot of the game. Got it? EA is trying to sell the part of the game that should have been included in the minimum package! Disgusting!
Also, so named additional missions are almost identical from geometrical point of view. I mean, they are very, very similar to each one; the only difference is just enemies and loot. Meh.
The giant spider boss is too enduring, and he is almost the only one boss in the game! Meh, once again.
Bottom line: buy the game at your own risk. I'd recommend to buy a GOTY/DC/Gold/Platinum version (if they will ever appear) of the game, including at least the ""Awakening"" DLC. Otherwise, you'll just miss the final part of the game.",7,10
metacritic,yourfavcomedion,dead-space-3,"As much as I would want to give this game a 10, it really doesn't deserve a 10. The story in here TOTALLY ruined the story for this series, seriously a machine or a temple or whatever made by the aliens, and in the game they are just stupid brain dead zombies, what? It just doesn't add up.  The story in here, was just........ Not interesting like the first 2. I let the 2nd one slide because they couldn't out do the first game, but this one was just a sad excuse for dead space. I'll give you some credit, because you made something new instead of just doing the same thing over and over again like call of duty is. I liked the co-op though, but what really made me mad was when there wasn't a split screen. Seriously, that would be so much easier than playing with stupid people who are 5 year old children. I did like the ""Make your weapon"" feature that was a nice touch. But the suits in here really stunk I mean, there was nothing really that cool about these suits. I also liked the ammo, not ammo for a specific weapon. Would I recommend this? Eh, maybe depends on what you want, if you wanted it for the story, you would be really disappointed in this game if you liked the story like me. I would really want to give this game a higher score, but it just doesn't deserve it.",5,10
metacritic,Lord_Lymburner,halo-combat-evolved,"When Halo: Combat Evolved launched in 2001, it wasn’t just a game—it was a revolution for the FPS genre on consoles. Developed by Bungie, it quickly cemented itself as one of the most influential titles in gaming history. Here’s why it remains a masterpiece to this **** game’s story introduced players to an unforgettable sci-fi universe. The mysterious Halo ringworld, the enigmatic Covenant, and the chilling Flood all set the stage for an epic adventure led by the stoic yet iconic Master Chief. The narrative struck a balance between action-packed sequences and deep world-building, leaving players hooked from start to finish.Gameplay-wise, Halo: Combat Evolved raised the bar with its finely-tuned mechanics and expansive sandbox levels. From vehicle combat with the now-famous Warthog to the satisfying variety of its arsenal, every moment felt exciting and fresh. The game’s AI was a revelation for the time, offering dynamic encounters that kept players on their toes. While some levels, like The Library, were criticized for repetitiveness, the overall level design was groundbreaking.Multiplayer was another standout feature. The split-screen co-op campaign and intense LAN multiplayer battles created countless memories for players. It was here that Halo built a strong sense of community, laying the foundation for the franchise’s future success.Visually and technically, the game was a marvel for its era. Its graphics were stunning for a console title, and its unforgettable soundtrack, composed by Martin O'Donnell and Michael Salvatori, added a layer of grandeur to every **** conclusion, Halo: Combat Evolved wasn’t just a game—it was a moment that defined a generation of gaming. Its blend of storytelling, gameplay innovation, and multiplayer excitement made it an instant classic that remains beloved to this day. It’s not just one of the best FPS games ever made—it’s a cultural milestone.",10,10
metacritic,JLord701,halo-combat-evolved,"One of the most legendary and influential games of all time without question. What sets this game apart from others from this time is how well the game has aged. This game still has some of the best controls of any fps. The graphics have certainly aged, but there is an odd charm in their simplicity. The story is simple, solid, and entertaining, but it's still the weakest narrative of the bungie games in my opinion. As far as flaws go, the library mission is a mental endurance test and a descent into madness. I think it only stands out this way because every other level is basically perfect. I'd also say that some weapons like the assault rifle and needler are worthless, even on easier difficulties. Of course I should also mention how overpowered the pistol is in multiplayer. In the face of everything this game gets right, these flaws don't even come close to ruining it. Most of the weapons and vehicles are incredibly fun to use. Many of the levels are open with a sandbox feel and can be completed in multiple ways, which is especially impressive given it was an xbox launch title, although it should go without saying that the master chief collection is the definitive way to play this game. It feels great playing at higher resolutions and framerates and you also get online multiplayer, which was not in the original release. Halo combat evolved is a game everyone should play. Even with a few flaws, it's not just one of the best games of all time, but also one of the most influential.",9,10
metacritic,seriousboris,halo-combat-evolved,"Прошёл оригинальный культовый Halo 2001 года на пк. Мне, к сожалению, попалась версия с отвратительным пиратским переводом от Kudos (вроде как-то так называлась контора этих хуесосов), поэтому экспириенс был попорчен и сюжет мне пришлось читать на вики, будь проклята контора этих выблядков. Графика по меркам 2001 года не выдающаяся (по крайней мере с высоты 2024 года мне так показалось), но надо понимать, что это порт с консоли + тут много открытых пространств, и в целом претензий к визуалу нет(крутой и атмосферный дизайн, кстати). Стрелять тут весело, постоянно используешь практически весь арсенал, который попадается, очень полезны гранаты. Однако понятия не имею как оно игралось на консоли, мне кажется, что без аим ассиста играть в это не получится. Крутой дизайн врагов, большинство локаций это какие-то бункеры либо космические корабли коридорные, но когда появляются открытые локации, становится круто. Более того, в игре очень много свободы действия, никто тебя не гонит, можно облететь хоть весь уровень, тут есть летательные аппараты и как сделан полет мне очень доставило (но иногда ты теряешься, что не круто). Если судить по вики, то и сюжет тут интересный. Насколько я знаю эта игра поражала своей технологичностью на момент выхода, но пк игроков таким было не удивить, как мне кажется.

The gun-play is actually quite good and can be fun for the first few minutes but after hours of killing identical monsters with few in-between it leaves the game feeling more like a shooting simulator with some small interesting story elements peppered in-between. I found the 2nd Halo game good at addressing this issue and adding more interesting story and removing a lot of the repetitive gun-play that gets dry really fast. Overall it doesn't hold a candle to the 2nd entry in the season.,2,10

Very Smart AI for 2001 and honestly holds up over a lot of AAA Games we get today

Enemies have obvious strengths and weaknesses and smart players will be rewarded to paying attention to these

One Shotting hunters with pistol **** tho :(

Multi Faction Battles in the second half of the campaign are very entertaining!

Every Weapon is Viable to use, even on legendary difficulty.

Legendary is an extremely tough, but fair challenge (while still being fun to play) Rocket Flood are the only exception to this, they aren't as bad, say, halo 2 Sniper Jackals- But they are not fun to fight for sure.

Simple, but effective story- nothing in this game is not iconic; Covenant, The Chief, The Halo Ring, The Flood, The Forerunners. And one of the best twists in all of gaming, yea you Know ;)

metacritic,SteinZero,halo-combat-evolved,"Halo: Combat Evolved é um verdadeiro marco nos jogos de tiro em primeira pessoa. Lançado em 2001, o jogo ainda permanece como um dos meus favoritos até hoje.

A história de Halo: Combat Evolved me cativou desde o início. Interpretando o papel do icônico Master Chief, embarquei em uma jornada épica contra a ameaça alienígena conhecida como Covenant. A narrativa envolvente me fez mergulhar em um universo de ficção científica complexo, cheio de segredos e reviravoltas. A medida que avançava pelos níveis cuidadosamente projetados, desvendava a história e me conectava emocionalmente aos personagens e ao mundo ao meu redor.

A jogabilidade de Halo: Combat Evolved é simplesmente incrível. Os controles são responsivos e intuitivos, permitindo movimentos suaves e precisos. Os combates são empolgantes e estratégicos, com uma ampla variedade de armas e veículos à minha disposição. Explorar os vastos ambientes do jogo, utilizando veículos como o Warthog ou o icônico tanque Scorpion, adicionou uma camada extra de diversão e estratégia às batalhas.

O design dos níveis é um dos pontos altos do jogo. Cada ambiente é meticulosamente detalhado e oferece uma combinação perfeita de espaços abertos e fechados. A exploração é incentivada, e eu me encontrava constantemente descobrindo segredos escondidos e rotas alternativas. Além disso, a variedade de cenários é impressionante, desde paisagens alienígenas exuberantes até instalações militares futuristas, cada um deles repleto de detalhes visuais deslumbrantes.

A trilha sonora de Halo: Combat Evolved é uma verdadeira obra-prima. As composições de Martin O'Donnell e Michael Salvatori criam uma atmosfera emocionante e imersiva, acompanhando perfeitamente as situações de combate e os momentos de suspense. Até hoje, os temas musicais do jogo me transportam de volta aos momentos emocionantes que vivenciei durante a jogatina.",10,10

With its refined mechanics, balanced maps, and innovative Forge mode, it revolutionized how players engage with each other. Forge allowed for unprecedented creativity, empowering players to design their own multiplayer maps and game modes, fostering a community-driven culture that still resonates today. The addition of saved films was groundbreaking, enabling players to relive and share their most epic moments.Visually, for its time, Halo 3 was stunning, and its soundtrack by Martin O'Donnell elevated the entire experience with its soaring, iconic compositions.

Halo 3 is truly immaculate in every way. Its art style will stand the test of time as one of the greatest in history, upscaled and in 4K with ray tracing mods Halo 3 looks as good or BETTER than most next generation games based on the strength of its art style alone.

Gameplay its literal perfection from start to finish each and every match, the penultimate hybrid of everything I love about Halo CE and Halo 2, two juggernaut FPS titles both 10/10 or higher, fused into one incomparable experience. Forge set the standard for console developed map creators for casual to hardcore gamers. Halo 3's ranking system is more addictive than coke, and vastly more satisfying. The armor customization is amazing, despite there being much less armor in Halo 3 than in Halo Reach, the quality of Halo 3's customization is as top tier as you can ever get.

GOATED maps that will be played thousands of years later. Guardian is simply one of the finest arena maps ever developed. The Pit is the greatest symmetrical map ever designed in history. Valhalla is Blood Gulch on a thousand steroids, with graphics and physics that rival and exceed numerous video games from 2023 without any effort at all.

Theatre mode is perfect. Weapons are as balanced as it gets with the perfect tuning between Halo CE's overpowered sandbox and Halo 2's underpowered sandbox (sans the slightly nerfed Battle Rifle). Theatre mode was a decade ahead of everything else in the industry to such a degree, that no other studio including Bungie themsleves has been able to replicate Halo 3's UI.

Halo Infinite is much better than at launch, if they had triple the budget 343i could NEVER even begin to come close to Halo 3's untouchable design at every level. A must play for any FPS fans, and the only way to truly judge Halo is to experience this game firsthand. Most of my friends many of whom do not care for Halo will play Halo 3 for hours without apology, because this game is the greatest FPS of all time!",10,10
metacritic,Lelo_Oficial,halo-3,"Para mim esse jogo é o melhor jogo de Halo já feito, eu amo sua história, suas músicas, seus personagens e acima de tudo sua gameplay, me entreteu por horas e horas, volta e meia sinto vontade de rejogar, mesmo após já ter zerado tantas vezes.",10,10

In conclusion, Halo 3's blend of gripping storytelling, innovative gameplay mechanics, exceptional multiplayer offerings, and its impact on gaming culture make it deserving of a perfect 10 out of 10 rating. The game's legacy continues to thrive, and it remains a shining example of what a video game can achieve in terms of both quality and cultural significance.",10,10

The enemies are not easy, their intelligence is even very good in my point of view, and they are very annoying in a certain part, when they combo you together, there is not much to do.

metacritic,SteinZero,halo-3,"Como um grande fã da franquia Halo, tive o privilégio de jogar o tão aguardado Halo 3, e posso afirmar que esse jogo não decepciona. Lançado em 2007, ele elevou a série a um novo patamar e entregou uma experiência verdadeiramente épica.

A história de Halo 3 continua a saga do Master Chief e sua luta contra a ameaça dos Covenant e os Flood. O enredo envolvente me cativou desde o início e me manteve ansioso para descobrir o desfecho da trama. O jogo apresenta personagens carismáticos e momentos emocionantes, proporcionando um fechamento satisfatório para a trilogia original.

A jogabilidade de Halo 3 é simplesmente fenomenal. Os controles são precisos e responsivos, oferecendo uma experiência de tiro em primeira pessoa fluida e empolgante. A adição de novas armas e veículos, juntamente com a possibilidade de usar granadas incendiárias e golpes corpo a corpo aprimorados, adiciona uma camada extra de estratégia ao combate. A interação com os veículos é suave e satisfatória, permitindo momentos emocionantes de pilotagem.

O design dos níveis em Halo 3 é impressionante. Os ambientes são ricos em detalhes e visualmente deslumbrantes, desde paisagens alienígenas exuberantes até cenários de batalha devastados. Os níveis são bem projetados, oferecendo uma variedade de desafios e oportunidades para a exploração. Além disso, a introdução do modo cooperativo online, que permite jogar com amigos, adiciona uma dimensão adicional à experiência, tornando as batalhas ainda mais emocionantes e divertidas.

A trilha sonora de Halo 3, mais uma vez composta por Martin O'Donnell e Michael Salvatori, é espetacular. As músicas evocam emoções intensas e complementam perfeitamente a ação do jogo, criando uma atmosfera imersiva. Cada melodia icônica me envolvia profundamente na narrativa e nos momentos de maior tensão, ampliando a experiência do jogo.

Halo 3 também apresenta um modo multiplayer robusto, que proporciona horas intermináveis de diversão. O modo multiplayer oferece uma ampla variedade de opções, desde partidas competitivas até modos cooperativos, permitindo aos jogadores enfrentarem desafios e competirem com amigos e outros jogadores online. A personalização do personagem e a progressão no multiplayer acrescentam uma camada de longevidade ao jogo, mantendo-o interessante mesmo após várias horas de jogo.",10,10

metacritic,ZackH25,halo-3,Pretty much a flawless game. All the missions are excellent in design and story. The enemy variety may have not been huge but there was so many vehicles and weapons the enemies can use it makes fighting them quite addictive and fun. Gun play is extremely enjoyable especially when using certain weapons like the BR and the beam rifle. My favourite mission is the Covenant and the best parts involve  taking down scarabs. The multiplayer was also amazing and addictive as well. Overall a masterclass of an FPS game.,10,10

There are a lot of interesting missions that encapsulate the nostalgia that Halo CE invokes. The guns are really satisfying to use. The multiplayer is known for being amazing and it really is. Some gamemodes allow you to sweat it out against others and some are just pure chaos. the music is the same as the other games and kinda repetitive.,8,10
metacritic,AdrianOst077,halo-3,"Another 3 years, another amazing Halo game and sadly, the end of the original trilogy saga. Halo 3 once again excels the bar set by its predecessor's, giving us another amazing campaign experience with the return of a new multiplayer experience with the introduction on ranks and XP. For a while, I thought the Halo 2 campaign was my favourite in the franchise, Halo 3 leaves me torn between picking the two but both are awesome. The cutscenes, the story all really make for it. For 2007, the graphics really do shine what the Xbox 360 is capable of. I can see the hype for it back in 2007 and see why still to this day, Halo 3 is regarded as one of the best Halo games and a favourite among the fanbase. For 3 years running (2007-09), Halo 3 was the most popular and consistently played games on Xbox 360, with the player base always being in the tenth's of thousands worldwide. Another feature was introduced in Halo 3, Forge, a mode where you can mess around with maps and customise them to your liking. There really isn't a lack of content in this game. Completed the campaign? Try your luck on legendary or look for the hidden skulls that give you a new campaign experience when you play it. Work your way up in the rankings of multiplayer (which as of January 2022 has sadly shut down, so I haven't been able to experience it). Play co-op campaign with your friend.

Halo 3 really is an important game. A historical landmark that shows how much games meant to the developers who made them, especially Bungie. When developers truly dedicate time and passion and love for what they create, they create an amazing game like this. Halo 3 really had a close relationship with the fanbase and the developer, Bungie were seen like heroes. It saddens me to see a game like this from 2007, compared to corporate cash grabs that get pushed out every year, half-completed with the rest of the game being update over time through live service or DLC's for £15+, going back to a game like Halo 3 is important to remind us how gaming was back then. Making games out of the passion of being a game developer and pleasing the fanbase whilst at the same time, being successful in doing so, rather than feeding the masses with mediocre and standard generic first person shooters, with no sense of reward that doesn't require whipping out your wallet to feel like you have unlocked something cool.

Sadly even Halo has fallen into this pool with Halo Infinite, going back to the older games makes me really wish I could go back and relive these games in their prime, truly taking that time for granted. Didn't really know how good we had it back then. With this being said, I can't deny giving this game the first 10/10. There's a reason why Halo 3 is still being held to this high standard and communities such as Halo 3 Sunrise have pushed to reviving this game by hosting lobbies even after they've been shut, and that is the love this game has accumulated from developers who loved making games and were eager to show their passion projects, with money being a second thought.",10,10

Weapons have even less feel of power behind them than in Halo 2 and the changes to the flood from previous two games made them seem like soft sponges.

metacritic,memus,halo-3,"Meh, this one felt weak for (I played the Master Chief Collection version of it). It's the most fascistic and melodramatic of them all yet. I didn't enjoy it quite as much as CE or Reach. This game just rehashes everything from 1 & 2 and puts them in a bigger package. But I was more bored than entertained.

Pros:
+ The epilogue in zero gravity is kinda cool (and almost touching).
+ Some of the space cutscenes look epic (though, the low resolution reduces the illusion a bit).

Cons:
- Enemies and allies AI is weak. Allies in cars where dropped me 100+ from the cliffs. Enemies freeze from time to time.
- The story is confusing. Like it's cool that we change locations so quickly, but I wasn't clear what's happening and what's my role in it most of the game. Also, the dated engine doesn't allow to take the melodrama of the story seriously.
- The level navigation and encounter design are weak too. Like 10+ times I was confused on what I should do and where I should go.",5,10

Critics noted that some mechanics felt awkward or not fully **** Prometheans, while visually intriguing, didn’t quite capture the same magic as battling the Covenant or the Flood.Some long-time fans felt the changes to multiplayer, like the loadout system, deviated too far from the series' **** story, while ambitious, faced criticism for leaving portions of the plot underexplained, particularly regarding the Didact's motivations and the deeper lore of the Forerunners.",7,10

I can't imagine that many employees have much love or respect for Halo, because the game doesn't feel like Halo, but more like Call of Duty. The gameplay never feels like the original Halo games and fails to feel satisfying or fun. Enemy predictability is outright removed, making you wonder why you died most of the time, whereas in the original Halo games, when you died, it was entirely the player's fault and you could always tell why or how you died. Combat in the original games were fun in close quarters and it was always a viable option. In Halo 4, the combat is mostly done in mid-range to long-range because of the poor level design and unpredictable and inconsistent AI. The story is decent, and the only notable thing about it is the humanisation of the previously stoic and closed off Master Chief and Cortana.",5,10

And no, the campaign isn’t “half bad”. It’s embarrassing.",2,10
metacritic,lostleader,halo-4,"Halo has never been a game series that I really kept up with in terms of story, and while I certainly don't think the story is bad, a lot of issues with pacing, character development, and sameness fill most of Halo's cast.Cortana, on the other hand, is far more iconic and unique compared to the rest of the Halo series, being one of the few characters that can emote and talk more than a few cool lines or military jargon. Due to Cortana's unique position of constantly talking to Master Chief, Halo 4 opts to focus on their relationship with each other, however I feel the majority of the focus is paced wrong or feels too rushed at the end. While I don't think that Halo 4 did anything wrong in the direction it wanted for Cortana, I have to ask why they didn't go more into the relationship between the two main characters instead of the pacing issues we have with Halo 4. And it's not like Halo 4's story is particularly bad, it just feels like it's trying to be everywhere at once, when they clearly had a focus on Master Chief and Cortana. Introducing the new big bad with a few lines, setting up a new commander, and having a new batch of enemies feels a bit jarring, and out of place. None of these are outlandishly bad mind you, just not paced as well as they could be. Just all of the 1st act feels a bit everywhere, and the 2nd act doesn't pay everything off well enough to justify these flaws. In terms of new weapons, the new additions given by the more robotic aliens are super cool, and vastly useful compared to the Covenant's weaponry. There are some balancing issues with the bigger bads, mostly dealing with the knights that take far too long to take down, but for the most part all the engaging action of cover and fire that Halo is know for is there. Overall Halo 4 is a good entry in the series, and one that stands right next to Halo 3 in my opinion.",6,10

The game looks like every late-era xbox 360 game, dull and washed, a blur of green and grey most of the time. A few decent set pieces doesn't save half the game looking bad. But Halo 4's biggest sin is it's multiplayer. It takes a perfected formula, and turns it into Call of Duty. No equal starts, weapons avaliable in loadouts being so broken you would think it would be a power weapon. Map layout knowledge is also gone because of markers and weapon drops that completely ruin the games arena shooter roots.",2,10

metacritic,Yojimbo2015,halo-4,"The master chief and Cortana are stranded in hostile territory when they encounter a new alien threat in the form of the foot soldiers used by the Forerunners in the war against the Flood. This plot is essentially an excuse to relocate the war between Earth and the Covenant to some new environments and features new weapons, new vehicles and new enemies but otherwise the format is virtually unchanged. This is my only gripe; it's a little too similar to Halo 3 - but being too similar to my favourite game in the world isn't exactly a damning indictment. Another cutting edge FPS from the Halo franchise that fans will love just as much as the others.",10,10

Halo has surprised me yet again!",8,10
metacritic,ZackH25,halo-4,For me this halo game has the worst campaign of all the halo games. Mainly because in this game you have to fight the sentinels the most. It also made you fight the flying drone sentinels the most and that was so annoying. The missions were more boring than other halo games and the story was also very boring and dull- there were a few fun missions though- the one with the massive vehicle. The multiplayer tried to copy call of duty in some ways and so was quite meh. The maps of the multiplayer were quite solid though. Overall a disappointing halo game.,6,10
metacritic,SteinZero,halo-4,"Como um fã apaixonado da franquia Halo, aguardava com grande expectativa o lançamento de Halo 4. Desenvolvido pela 343 Industries, o jogo prometia dar continuidade à saga do Master Chief de uma forma empolgante. Infelizmente, devo admitir que, embora tenha seus pontos positivos, Halo 4 não conseguiu atingir completamente o nível de excelência estabelecido pelos jogos anteriores.

A história de Halo 4 inicia uma nova trilogia na franquia, trazendo elementos intrigantes e aprofundando ainda mais o universo de Halo. O enredo apresenta uma abordagem mais focada nos personagens, explorando a relação entre o Master Chief e a inteligência artificial Cortana. Essa abordagem mais emocional e íntima adiciona camadas interessantes à narrativa. No entanto, em comparação com os jogos anteriores, a história pode parecer um tanto confusa e menos envolvente, perdendo um pouco do impacto que esperávamos.

A jogabilidade de Halo 4 mantém a essência da série, oferecendo tiroteios empolgantes e uma variedade de armas e veículos. Os controles são responsivos e aperfeiçoados, proporcionando uma experiência sólida e familiar aos fãs. No entanto, algumas adições e mudanças na jogabilidade podem dividir a opinião dos jogadores. Por exemplo, o sistema de regeneração de vida, embora seja comum em outros jogos de tiro, afasta-se do estilo mais estratégico e desafiador dos jogos anteriores de Halo. Isso pode diminuir a sensação de estar enfrentando uma batalha épica e exigir menos táticas de sobrevivência.

O design dos níveis em Halo 4 é visualmente impressionante. Os ambientes são ricos em detalhes e apresentam uma variedade de paisagens alienígenas. No entanto, em comparação com os jogos anteriores da série, os níveis podem parecer mais lineares e menos abertos, perdendo parte da sensação de exploração e descoberta. Apesar disso, a qualidade gráfica e os efeitos visuais são de alto padrão, adicionando imersão à experiência.",10,10

No geral é um dos melhores da franquia e um dos melhores FPS que eu já joguei, é um jogo nota 10!",10,10
metacritic,DavidBondy,halo-4,"Halo 4 is simply okay.  While elements of the sound design, graphics, voice acting, and overall polish of the game have improved from the previous Halo titles, the game is a significant step down in terms of gameplay.  The enemy AI, a long-standing strength of the entire Halo franchise, is one of Halo 4's biggest weaknesses during the campaign.  The new faction is also pretty unfun to fight.  They're better than the flood, but that's a really low bar.  The level design is sub-par by the standards of Bungie's Halo games (but probably average compared to most shooters.) It just feels average on all accounts of gameplay.  I think it's telling that out of all the games in the Master Chief Collection, this is the one I would least enjoy replaying.

I do recommend the Master Chief Collection, which this game is part of.  However, if you're looking to only buy some but not all the games in the MCC, then feel free skipping out on this game.  You're not going to miss much.",6,10

metacritic,JLord701,halo-4,"I'll be honest. This is not as good as the bungie games. The story and gameplay are both inferior to the masterpieces bungie crafted all those years ago. However, this is a very good and a very well made game. It really grew on me the 2nd time I played it. The first time, I did not enjoy the campaign. Maybe it was because I had covid. On the other hand, the 2nd time, my opinion completely changed. I don't know exactly what did it, but I was able to appreciate the story much more. The gameplay on the other hand, is still certainly what suffers. Don't get me wrong, I still enjoyed it, but it suffers from linear level design and unpredictable AI. Probably my biggest problem however, is the extremely low ammo count for some weapons. Some, like the battle rifle for example, stay , more or less the same, but weapons like  the plasma pistol have such a low count compared to previous games. It's unfortunate, because you will likely use this weapon often on higher difficulties. I am also not the biggest fan of the art style. It isn't bad in its own right, but it more or less completely abandons the style of halo 3. From a technical standpoint though, this game looks and sounds incredible. It's crazy to think this game came out nearly ten years ago on the 360. It looks even better on 9th gen, and 120fps is greatly appreciated. Overall, while this did not live up to bungie's excellent halo trilogy, it is still extremely well made, and takes the series in new directions. I think it's the best game since reach.",8,10
metacritic,cchenders40,halo-4,"Hot take: This is the best halo story campaign wise and it has the best progression system in its multiplayer of any halo game.

The only thing helping this game is the multiplayer is fun even though it still doesn't feel like traditional halo multiplayer and feels much more washed out.",6,10
metacritic,memus,halo-4,"Something felt off.

Pros:
+ The new machines introduces by 343 are super cool: e.g. Mammoth, Mantis.
+ In general, the biology-inspired designs work: e.g. electric dogs, Didact's ship as chrysalis.
+ The retcon for index is kinda cool (though execution suffers).
+ So the game shines the most when it goes the furthest away from the original trilogy.

Cons:
- Gunplay feels off. There is no punch to guns. Enemies are bullet-spongy.
- Levels are meh. In a sense, you go through a set of very small rooms and need to kill all enemies to proceed further. Again and again. It makes gameplay feel kinda random, more like Quake 3 Arena or Doom rather than Halo.
- Enemy AI is meh.
- The graphics are meh. Some designs are quite cool. But there are many visual glitches (even to this day). Huge ships just disappear in the air after the explosion. Items re-spawn behind you. All this breaks the illusion quite a lot.
- People look wooden. And the cutscene art direction in general is not up to the standard of previous games. Also, the story between Master Chief and Cortana will make you cringe.",6,10

The way they showed the emotional bond between Chief and Cortana and how it has evolved after what they've been through the past three games was great. The new characters all felt like they belonged and added to the game and its story. The game was a little short compared to Halo: CE and the music honestly wasn't very memorable at all except on the last level but other than that it was an amazing game.",9,10

Everything is very grey after a while. The story should have been a standalone. Everything felt very pasted on. Like it wasnt meant to be there, but still is. Even tho i still really wanted to finish it to get the full HALO experience i became very bored with the gameplay. The convenant are still very fun to fight, but the prometheans not at all. The best part of the game is the first hour or so, after youre done riding the warthog down the mountain is drops off exponentially. The starfox like mission was still a lot of fun tho.

No. Halo 4's gameplay is amazing and the graphics aren't bad at all, I'd even say Halo 4 is one of the best-looking Xbox 360 titles to this day. The story may be a little lackluster and new enemies may be annoying but the game's still... worthy. Worthy Halo game. Still not entirely good but fine enough to be enjoyed.",7,10

I definitely recommend this game to anyone and everyone as I truly believe this to be the best Halo game!
There is so much packed into the story and I think that 343i did such a great job with their first outing with Master Chief! Also, I think he has never looked cooler. His armor design is gorgeous and I love the more rugged worn down look to his colors.

metacritic,Dperks,halo-4,I really want to love Halo 4 and I've had to of played this game like a dozen times by this point. But after my most recent playthrough I cant say more then its okay.  Halo 4 has a lot of issues that hold it back for me but I will say that my favorite aspect of the game is the story. I love learning more about the forerunners and having that human connection with Cortana developing rampancy I thought were all great ideas. Execution wise though was handled kinda rough. Most of the important info about the forerunners is jammed into one exposition filled cutscene so if your not finding the hidden terminals in levels your probably lost. And the Didact as a villain could of been so much more. But the stuff with Cortana is great still think it could of been handled better but I do like the idea of making chief more human and exploring that personal aspect. And I also do like seeing him confront a superior like with what happens in the story even if it does seem kind of dumb for it to happen in the first place. So the story is rough but overall I like it where the game falls pretty flat is the gameplay. This is the least fun to play FPS Halo game to date. Where to begin the weapons for the covenant and these new promethium weapons just feel bad and some weapons are literally useless. Each faction needs to have a weapon equivalent which just makes it feel very redundant. Like you don't need 3 different assault rifle weapons especially when 2 of them are worthless. Enemy AI is also notably bad In this game they will constantly just stand their or get stuck on terrain and when compared to even Halo 1 its just sad. But what really kills me is the Prometheans because their just not fun to fight at all in this game. And theirs no verity in how they fight or how you should approach them its like of course I want to after the flying guys who can revive fallen enemy's and fling grenades back because their so damn annoying. And like previously stated their weapons' are all redundant and not interesting to use. And the grenade they have has to be the most useless grenade in any mainstream shooter cause that thing cant kill anything I swear. Finally I like most everyone else hate the redesigns in this game because well they just look ugly at least the covenant ones do. I don't mind the guns and equipment being redesigned as much but the elites just look wrong in this game. And I wish they didn't change Chiefs armor not only because it wasn't necessary and didn't make sense considering that he was stuck in a broken ship. But it would of made the ending when he goes into that big room with the other Spartans way more impactful if he had the same armor from the last 2 games. With all its battle damage he's received and the fact it would of seemed outdated compared to the other Spartans really showing that he's alone and outdated now I think would of made the ending much more impactful. Overall the stories okay they also had spartan ops which can be fun and gives a narrative after Halo 4 but because they reuse a lot of levels like way to much it gets quickly repetitive and boring. And the multiplayer is also my least favorite of the FPS Halo games and its hard to explain why. But a lot of my complaints about the guns and gameplay do translate to the multiplayer and it just feels the most generic Halo game to play unfortunately. Overall Halo 4 isn't bad but it just falls so short compared to its predecessors. With its more generic feel and plot that needed to get flushed out more and the fact that its probably the glitchiest in the series as well as I've experienced some bad technical problems with this game before. Such as a level being unplayable half way through meaning I had to restart the level.,6,10

metacritic,Antonette_87,halo-4,"Halo 4 es el primer videojuego de 343 Industries, y hace muchos cambios para empezar uno de esos cambios fue el diseño de personajes, donde el Jefe Maestro parece un puto tanque con extremidades y Cortana esta mas rica, así que punto doble. En Halo 4 añaden nuevos enemigos, y  con ello un arsenal mucho mas amplio, y son muy diferentes a las demás y se siente muy bien al disparar. Yo creo que es el Halo que añade mas armas detrás de Halo 2, muy bien aquí por parte de 343. Falta hablar de la historia donde añaden mucha profundidad en los personajes en general, mas en el Jefe Maestro y en Cortana, y los enemigos me gustan en el apartado de gameplay (aunq el jefe final es una mierda xd) pero no me gusta como esta implementado en la historia, ya que no llega al nivel del Pacto ni mucho menos, que vuelve y no tiene ninguna relevancia en la historia, por cierto Halo 4 es una historia de ¿amor? entre el Jefe Maestro y Cortana, no me desagrada la idea pero tampoco es que me guste excesivamente, para mi lo que mas me atraía de Halo eran sus enemigos, conflictos, el anillo, etc. No esq me entusiasme si el Jefe Maestro se coje a Cortana. Como ves en este Halo cambian muchas cosas, y una de ellas es el multijugador, yo no lo jugue pero he escuchado que el multijugor estaba algo roto porq había una habilidad donde podías ver a tus enemigos detras de las paredes (q divertido) y se parecía mucho al COD, bien, PORQ HALO LE COPIA AL COD??? q desesperado tenía que estar 343 para copiar al COD, ah si por cierto este Halo esta roto y bugead completamente el modo historia donde literalmente hay un bug que literalmente te prohibe hace UNA MISIÓN ENTERA, en fin, una verguenza, aún así el juego es notable, tiene muchos fallos pero aún así se pude disfrutar, la primera obra de 343, no esta nada mal, a ver que hacen con Halo 5...",8,10

metacritic,Halo4Forever,halo-4,"Halo 4 Campaign is good and i'm tired of pretending it's not. It has nice story, good voice acting, best looking Cortana, good graphics, solid soundtrack (both discs). I personally think it's very important to overall Halo lore that Halo 4 Campaign exists and i think it was easily one of the best video games of 2012. Yes, multiplayer was bad and that's why i almost feel that Halo 4 should be just treated as Campaign. Whenever someone says they hate Halo 4 or that Halo 4 was bad, my first question is ""are you talking about Campaign or Multiplayer?"". You can't say that Halo 4 as a whole game just ****, because you didn't like the multiplayer part. I feel like lots of people who Hate 4, just hate it's multiplayer and they never even really cared about story/Campaign part. For me lore/story/campaign always comes first, multiplayer is just fun bonus thing. I agree that both equally matter, but when one part of the game **** and other part is great, you can't say that whole thing ****. That's why i feel it's so easy for some to say that Halo 4 ****, because they never cared about Campaign anyway. Either way i think it's solid and important game, obviously not the best (that would be Halo 3). Does anyone agree/disagree?

metacritic,L3Fari0us,halo-4,"A drive for innovation that felt just right in some places, while it felt like it went too far on others.

Halo 4 is the first one not developed by Bungie, but it's clear that those behind it were big fans of what had come before.
The graphics are the best the series has ever seen, the art style and environments are top notch, for the most part, and the soundtrack retains the Halo magic but with a new spin.
The gameplay is very strong and the abilities feel more useful than before, but the addition of sprint as a toggle instead of another ability might have been too much.
The main focus of the story, which is the relationship between Master Chief and his A.I. companion, Cortana, is outstanding and it feels deeply personal, on a level that the series has never explored before and it resonates with the player. The main antagonistic force, however, was terribly implemented. A whole new enemy faction, which made no sense if you hadn't read or seen any of the extended material and throughout my playthrough I tried connecting the dots that from the information certain terminals would give. Their design also felt like something that did not belong in Halo and it was appalling when this new enemy faction appeared on the same place as the Covenant (original enemy faction). It was a night and day comparison.

In conclusion, Halo 4 is at its best when it tries to be a small contained experience. The relationship between Master Chief and Cortana was the highlight of the whole experience, however the new enemy faction was so badly implemented and felt like a fish out of water. It was 343i's first big step and they tried to leave a mark. In my eyes, despite some sizable missteps, they succeeded.",8,10
metacritic,Kostas101,halo-4,"This was my first Halo game, and even though I enjoyed it, it was a very shallow experience. The gameplay is fun, the graphics are fantastic, the character models look great, and it's a well made game overall, but the story & characters are forgettable.",6,10

But the music of halo 4 didnt feel like halo music. It wasnt bad just not halo music, and the characters didnt have that much life into them either. the game just didnt make me care enought about them, and the multiplayer felt too much like a COD wannabe. But halo 4 is a great play for a good story but would not recommend the multiplayer.",8,10
metacritic,ItsaBroom,halo-4,"My favorite Halo game. The emotion and character is incredible. As we see Cortana begin to deteriorate and Chief struggle to come to terms with that. My biggest problem is the Promethean Knights, Watchers and the Didact. The Knights **** to fight against. They give so little feedback to the player, it can be really hard to notice when then shields drop, especially in a hectic firefight. The Watchers are a part of this. Nothing hurts more then killing a Knight, redirecting your attention to other enemies only for a watcher to come along and reconstruct the Knight. That hurts so bad. And the shield the Watchers can deploy on Knights make them **** even more. The last problem is the Diadact, or how criminally underused the Didact is. He is an awesome villain with a massive presence, but he’s barely in the game. It feels like they have an antagonist to have an antagonist rather then create a fleshed out enemy. I also really wish the Didact had become the enemy of Halo 5 instead of Cortana, but thats a little bit more of a problem with that game rather then this game. Even with these problems, I love Halo 4. My favorite Halo game, followed only by Halo CE.",10,10

Annoying but beautiful
Halo 4 is a 6 hour long first person shooter and is the first standalone game from 343 studios.
And sadly after the great direction halo 3 was taking for the series, halo 4 approves the series and takes some major steps back at the same time..
Visually halo 4 is the most modern looking and beautiful halo game ive played so far.. I love the feeling of level variety here, not something you really get in halo games.. all the way up until reach every level kind of looked and felt the same, with no standouts.. here it felts like an actual world was crafted rather than generic space stations over nd over and over.. at least for the most part.. because the copy paste that the hole series suffers from is here as well… made worse by the fact that halo 4 is too easy to get lost in.. youll be in a new area and have no idea, thinking you went around in circles because again so many assets and layouts are just copy and pasted to new areas… and the progression indactors are just awful hee.. I get the point is to make the game not feel linear, but instead I just feel like a chicken running around with my head cut off, trying to trigger a door opening to move on…
Halo 4 does attempt to add something new to the series with these robot like enemies and new weapons, but theyre just annoyingly frustrating..
Ive personallyappreciated tht in every halo game up until this point you could just run through, especially tring to get through the entire series before infinite comes out.. but here in halo 4 there are tons of moments youre forced to clear the room, and the game really doesn’t do much to indicate this is necessary.. which is something that should’ve been done considering, once again.. halo games don’t typically make you clear a room to be able to move on.. . which brings me to the annoying enemies.. these robot enemies ar infurating to deal with.. halo 4 has an awful checkpoint system and in between these awful checkpoints are these enemies that spit bullets at you, or are large power houses followed by drones that not only shield enemies, but they heal them, they can also shoot, and they fold when you shoot at them.. and when you finally do hit them they seem to just absorb all of your bullets.. making th final stretch of this game more infuriating than all of the worst parts of the halo series combined..
Halo 4 is a good game, it’s a challenging game.. it strays away from halo too much in the end.. which could be a good thing, but isn’t a good thing here…
Im hoping for more positive change with halo 5, and less frustration.
I give Halo 4
a 7/10",7,10
metacritic,EmilBowtie,halo-4,"I hate halo 4
Guys this is the only time i can relate to oldfans ! Cause when someone hates fallout 4 i cant relate to them at all !  Cause yeah , on paper and in art of an action fallout 4 is worse than the other fallouts , but in the end its a great game and it is in my favourites . But when it comes to halo ... dude . Halo 4 **** , i cant even think of tthis game as a halo : AI is stupid as hell ( which is already turns it into a pickle , cause smartass ai is the main thing that makes halo better , harder , and smarter than the other shooter games even now days ) , graphics is not bad specially for xbox 360 but dude the display is 1990 even the CE didnt  had that bad one , in other halos the gameplay was so impactfull u had a lot of different guns enemies and cars which u can use ( the same thing was in halo 4 but they were giving it to u rarely and not in the time it was funny or something , so u can see that its not bungie were creating a game ) . There actually is the hing which makes game a little better - story . Idk i think all the didact and forerunners ark were AWESOME ! And  i also liked that in the end it took a lot more dark tuen . It reminded me of previous games that did the same thing but better . Also multiplayer was nice cause u know , i like halos 3 mp better but as a zoomer i cant lie that i liked new graphics and shooting little more . But in the end the game kinda **** , and i am a zoomer so its really shows HOW BAD game is . Cause nowdays games consumed by zoomers are even worse , and even known that fact game is still pretty bad !
So thats why i am excited for halo infinite , through the trailers and leaks it looks a more like old games !",0,10

metacritic,Dom007,halo-4,"Halo 4 is infinitely better than halo 5 and it has some good concepts, it just executes them poorly. The story isn't by all means dreadful, however it just feels uneventful compared to previous Halo games. The characters aren't by all means bad, they're just not as good as the previous Halo games and some are even unlikeable.
Halo 4 however falls flat on its gameplay. It's boring, not very fun, it's tedious and some of the enemies are just poorly designed. Enemy variety has never been Halo's strong point, but no matter the enemy type they where always fun to fight. Halo 4 is the opposite, the promethians are not fun to fight and the covenant are not fun either.
So whilst there are some nice concepts with halo 4, like the story for example. It just isn't a fun game to play.",6,10

metacritic,SteinZero,halo-wars-2,"A história de Halo Wars 2 retoma após os eventos do primeiro jogo, com a tripulação do Spirit of Fire emergindo de um sono criogênico décadas depois. Eles se encontram em um confronto com uma nova ameaça chamada Banished, liderada pelo temível Atriox. A narrativa é bem elaborada e apresenta uma progressão cativante, repleta de reviravoltas e momentos emocionantes. Os personagens são carismáticos e bem desenvolvidos, envolvendo os jogadores em suas jornadas e motivações.

A jogabilidade de Halo Wars 2 mantém a essência do jogo original, oferecendo uma experiência de estratégia em tempo real fluida e acessível. Os controles são intuitivos tanto no console quanto no PC, permitindo que os jogadores comandem suas forças e explorem as mecânicas estratégicas de forma eficiente. A construção de bases, o gerenciamento de recursos e a tomada de decisões táticas são elementos-chave que adicionam profundidade e variedade ao jogo.

Uma das melhorias notáveis ​​em relação ao jogo anterior é a adição do modo Blitz. Este modo combina elementos de estratégia em tempo real com um sistema de cartas, permitindo que os jogadores personalizem e adaptem suas táticas de acordo com as cartas disponíveis. É uma abordagem inovadora que adiciona um elemento estratégico adicional ao gameplay e proporciona partidas rápidas e emocionantes.

Visualmente, Halo Wars 2 é impressionante. Os detalhes dos ambientes, unidades e efeitos visuais contribuem para uma experiência imersiva e visualmente atraente. A variedade de locais, desde vastas paisagens alienígenas até bases inimigas detalhadas, adiciona profundidade e diversidade ao jogo. A trilha sonora, composta por Gordy Haab e Brian Trifon, complementa perfeitamente a atmosfera do jogo, criando uma experiência auditiva envolvente.",10,10

metacritic,Stan_Osbourne,halo-wars-2,"Surprisingly, the sequel was weaker than the original, in my opinion. Despite the fact that the cutscenes here are made just like games of the level of the mainline of the series, the graphics in the game itself are quite simple and not shiny at all + an epileptic seizure is possible, since very often the cutscenes are very torn.

The company is very short, and as usual, we are given the opportunity to play only for representatives of one faction out of two (in the last part, the company was for one faction out of three) There are two more companies, but I do not know if it is possible to play for a new faction there or no - they are sold as separate DLC. It's just great, remember how you used to buy an RTS strategy as a child, and they're all the companies were available as you progressed through the game? So, forget it. I think that this is disrespectful to the players and at times worse than microtransactions. Compared to the first part, where all the content was included in one game, this is a step back.

para ser honesto esto es lo peor de halo Wars 2, es malo? no pero es lo menos en cuanto el juego, en el lanzamiento apenas encontrabas partidas peor hoy en dia pero cuando encuentras una partida créeme que vale la pena la espera, aunque personalmente no me gusta mucho el modo blitz igual es muy divertido! pero no seria el primer modo que jugaría yo

metacritic,techboy,halo-wars-2,"RTS games are dead... well, no wonder!
This game is a bad joke!

Graphics and Blitz idea is okay...

But the game in overall is total boring and it's gameplay pretty simplified.
Controlling units as a bulk is the only thing that is possible.
It is not manageable multiple units separately without control groups.
Singleplayer campaign is ridiculous, you get pre-defined ways to solve a mission.
You have to follow specific roads... also you get fighting scenes, which take your control of the game off. Well, even with two fractions we have that all seen before e.g. Warcraft 1-2... and yes, there also the fractions had same units in different skins... where is the innovation?

MOST WORST THING EVER, PLAYING A RTS WITH A CONTROLLER...
WHERE IS THE MOUSE AND KEYBOARD SUPPORT???

I am still playing Starcraft 2, since this game is still the king of RTS genre.
Not also the Multiplayer is still the best (1on1), also the Singleplayer campaign outstanding!

Halo Wars 2 is a really bad game.

The new Graphics suffer much like Halo 4 & 5 do from the new Art-style taking away to more gritty and human look to all the buildings, weapons Armor and vehicles

Combat has become more a rock paper scissors meaning if you pick the wrong unit theirs no chance of you coming out on top, you have to counter with the correct unit to win

The story picks up right where the last Halo: Wars leaves of, it deepens the plot of the post Human-Covenant War galaxy, and gives the characters of Halo: Wars a great continuation of development and story. The maps are beautiful and the multiplayer is fun and mostly balanced.    Where Halo: Wars 2 is lacking is it sticks the middle finger up to its long time fans.

metacritic,DarkW0lf,halo-wars-2,"Coming from a person who held the highest achievable rank on halo wars 1 and absolutely loved that game and I still play it occasionally, I must say my opinion is a little biased. However biased for a good reason. The first halo wars made by bungie was a good game. The second game is a terribly balanced money hungry shell of the first game. To understand why halo wars 2 deserves 3/10 at best, you have to understand what made the first halo wars such a good game. It was the best RTS game on console because it was slightly less complicated than games like command and conquer and that made a faster more action packed game. Mostly, halo wars was such a good game because it was very very well balanced. Obviously there were stronger and weaker units unlocked on a tiered system but all units had a purpose and because the gap in strength of most units was not horrible as long as you weren't fighting a counter unit, armys pretty much leveled out and it left a lot of possibilities of what strategies to use and how you could use different kinds of units and armies to succeed in various ways. Additionally, it meant that like most games, players are more likely to succeed based on skill or strategy. I bought halo wars 2 for sixty bucks when it came out, hated it immediately, haven't touched it for over seven months. Decided maybe I was unfair in my original assessment so the last few weeks, I gave it a second chance, and after a couple weeks, I must conclude I was wrong initially. Its not just boring, its just a plain bad game. Even after things have supposedly been balanced, there are not just a few units but many units that basically aren't worth investing in at any point. Counter units that were key in the first halo wars to keeping a strategic balance between infantry, air and vehicles are always either way over powered or not even useful as a counter unit. The worst part of this whole thing is that there are certain units and leader abilities that are far superior to others making certain leaders who have weak abilities and weak units not even worth playing as. This was never a problem in the original halo wars. Every leader had slightly different advantages and UNSC units were slightly stronger that covenant units but the covenant could have a slightly larger army to make up for that. UNSC all had pretty similar leadership abilities and spartans. Covenant in response had much more powerful leaders on the field from the start of the game. There was a unique balance of power that made that game far more interesting. Halo wars 2 is not like this at all. Like I said before certain civilizations so to speak are really weak and others are over powered. Coincidentally, all the most powerful leadership abilities and units that just plain trash the rest of the competition including supposed counter units, belong to leaders that were released in later DLC's. That's right, you have to pay if you want to win. I'm not paying a cent more to be able to be on fair terms with all the rest of the players who paid. I think I am with most gamers when I say, if I pay full price for a competitive multiplayer game, I deserve to have a fair chance in multiplayer like everyone else. If you want to sell DLC, that doesn't bother me, just don't make them so strong that the rest of the original games leaders are basically pointless. There are thirteen leaders, and seven of them are free; almost half the leaders in the game have to be purchased after you just bought the game. 343 industries should be ashamed for practicing such terrible business and for basically charging players more money in order to have a significant advantage in multiplayer match making. I wont say there is nothing good about this game, it deserves some credit but the bad outweighs the good tremendously here. If you're thinking about buying, skip this one and play the original halo wars if you can. It is a far better game and there are still plenty of players on there.",3,10

metacritic,TatsMcGee,halo-wars-2,"One major life development is, I recently purchased an XBox One. There are a few Xbox exclusives that I want to play or have wanted to play and one of them is the Halo Wars series. I enjoy Real Time Strategy games and when I heard that this game was specifically designed for using a controller. I decided that this would be the first game that I play through on my Xbox.

The core gameplay is fun and the button mapping is perfect. I have no complaints about the controls or really the gameplay at all. To simplify what you do is, you are placed on a map and you have to then build up your base. You have to decide between building barracks that help you recruit more infantry units, garage which you can then recruit vehicle units, an airport which you recruit an air force. With building these there is some strategy involved deciding how you want to build your base and your army.

This is definitely a game that is meant to streamline and simplify Real Time Strategy games. It’s both a positive and a negative when it comes to this game. It’s good because it’s bringing in new players to the niche genre but its also kind of boring because there isn’t quite enough to do. I would recommend that more experience RTS players play on a much harder difficulty.

The one thing that blew me away with this game was the graphics, especially in the cutscenes. There was a moment early, I couldn’t tell if it was an FMV (full motion video) or if it was actual game design. I was shocked when they finally showed characters face and then I knew it was pre-rendered.

The biggest downside to this game is the story itself. The only way I can describe this game’s story is that it feels like its the middle movie of a trilogy. At the end of the day, nothing happens. I don’t want to go into too much more detail but its a little disappointing that in a narrative sense, nothing changes or happens.

All together it’s a solid game and I picked it up for $20 off amazon. It certainly was worth that money but it was a little disappointing because I didn’t try any of the online things because I don’t have Xbox Live. So there is a lot there that I did not experience.",8,10

metacritic,louaynouneh,brawl-stars,"I exchanged over 10 emails with 9 different representatives across more than two weeks, yet my issue remains unresolved. All I received were excuses, no solutions. 

When a parent takes the time to reach out on behalf of their child, it should be clear that this is a serious matter. As a father, I’ve taken time out of my busy schedule to explain the situation thoroughly, and I expected a more considerate and effective response. 

My 12 year old son lost his ingame gems due to a refund I requested, as I noticed a transaction on my credit card with your company name that I didn’t immediately recognize. Like many parents, I manage multiple subscriptions and purchases for different games, and it’s not always easy to track where each charge comes from. Once I realized it was related to his game, I tried to fix the issue, but your team stated that the game’s system doesn't allow for any resolution in these scenarios. As a result, my son, a loyal player, is now stuck with negative gems. This doesn’t just affect his gameplay, it’s affecting him emotionally. He’s being teased by his friends, he can't access the same perks or progress in the game like others, and it’s having a ripple effect on his well-being both at home and school.

The only solutions your team provided were either to wait indefinitely for a possible ""recovery offer"" to randomly appear, or to spend $350 CAD to repurchase the gems I initially paid $15 for. Frankly, that’s unacceptable. Their customer support showed little initiative in finding a real solution and seemed more focused on closing the case than genuinely helping us. 

This has been a frustrating experience time, effort, and money wasted. 

At this point, I feel I have no option but to share this experience publicly, not out of anger, but to raise awareness. Corporations like theirs, making billions, should show more care for the players, especially the young, loyal ones who are the reason your game thrives in the first place.",2,10

However as most Mobile games, it's very predatory.

Yes, this has happened to me, because I've managed to get high trophies onlow level guys. The thing is though, I can't levle them up more, the currency is very limited. And iwth the usual, ""can only make x amount today"", unless you do the most grindies otgrindiest stuff there is, which gives a little bit, but for way too much effort. You have to wait for battle pass for real progression, or just pay a crapton of cash to become powerful. It's sad mobile gamers accept these things, because underneath it all, there is a great game.

Removed some stars, there was new event. No notification I was entering it, entered with a bad character just because I had freaking quest for it, didn't know I entered the gamemode. No confirmation or anything that you are entering gamemode. Just lost a chance, this is bad design.",3,10

You used to be able to buy it with in-game gems, so it was viable for F2P players to get it, but now you can't. Don't get me started on the Hypercharges. They cost 5,000 coins, plus the necessary coins AND power points to level up your brawler(s) to level 11. If you're up against three Hypercharged brawlers, you might as well give up. They become ridiculously OP and frustrating to fight. Another thing, if you win one or two matches in ranked, the game sets you up with terrible teammates and puts you against players two ranks above you who haven't taken a bath since 2015.

metacritic,Annigi,brawl-stars,"Le jeu est bon.
On a des mises à jour régulières depuis quelques années avec des nouveauté toujours présentes. La progression, quoique un peu plus rallongée récemment je trouve, est agréable. Les modes de jeu sont variés et chacun peut y trouver son style de jeu à travers les nombreux personnages jouables (78 au moment où j'écris cet avis).

Mais ces faiblesses résident dans ces éléments.
L'équilibrage à la sortie de chaque nouveau personnage n'est pas bien fait. Et de plus, le personnage à sa sortie est payant pour l'avoir 7 jours à l'avance. Et même si il existe de nombreux personnages : attendez-vous à voir souvent les mêmes jusqu’à (limite) à oublier l'existence de certains d'entre-eux. Ces personnages sont toujours les mêmes. Ceux de la méta actuelle. De plus, on a un petit problème d'une communauté toxique qui reste malheureusement présente malgré les efforts des développeurs et créateurs de contenus d'endiguer cela. Cette communauté empêche, limite, la progression.

Hormis ces défauts, le jeu est d'une bonne qualité auquel il y a peu de chance qu'il soit abandonné. Je recommande quand même si vous souhaitez y jouer : de vous trouver des amis avec qui jouer ou de prendre du recul sur le jeu. (Remarque : comme dans tous les jeux)",7,10

Then they made all the brawlers completely unbalanced and with every brawler that comes out you now just lose if you play against them because they are just hopelessly overpowered. You may ask, is there a way to play these brawlers? Well you could just spend €35 / 40$ to play one early. If you decide to unlock the brawler without paying for almost a full console/ pc game you could just safe your brawl credits for two months to buy them with those. And even then, supercell brings out one new op brawler every month, and nerfs the previous one, so you keep spending money. I can still remember the time where you could actually play the game, and get good at it instead of playing two games against the new “meta”, losing both, and then finally playing one game in a bot lobby so you keep playing.

metacritic,Fen1ma,clash-of-clans,"Clash of Clans — это игра про стратегию и герои, а точнее их прокачка отдаляет вас от стратегии.
С каждым уровнем ратушы от героев зависит всё больше и больше, начиная с 14 тх к героям ещё и питомцы присоединяются. Время затраченное на улучшение 1 уровня героя в среднем составляет неделю - целую неделю вы будите менее эффективным соклановцем в своём клане, чем игроки, у которых герои активны. Вы не сможете полноценно играть в КВ/ЛВК, тактика нападения лишь без 1 героя уже меняется. А если вы решили качать всех героев сразу и до предельно возможного уровня на вашем уровне тх, то будьте готовы играть и фрустрировать от плохих атак на кв 1-2 месяца.
Кто-то скажет, когда качаешь героев - просто не ходи на кв. В таком случаи вы играете не в Clash of Clans, вы играете в Clash of Farm and waiting. Самое лучшее, что есть в этой игре это клановые войны игнорируя их, вы теряете смысл игры. Атаки в глобале не сравнимы с кв, ночная деревня лишь дополнение к основной, Столица кланов - 5 атак в неделю, вам хватает такого количества?
Тоже самое можно сказать и про лабораторию, ваша армия не будет эффективной при недавнем переходе на следующий уровень ратуши, вы будете вынуждены выбирать из тех миксов, которые у вас прокачены, а не теми, которыми эффективно напасть на противника. Однако с героями эта ситуация более критична

Последние несколько обновлений игры меня очень порадовали, та же доп. жизнь героям, это нужно было добавить, как только они появились. Удаление дублирующих казарм - теперь вы не будете страдать месяц от долгого построения армии, максимум 2 недели. Но пока Supercell не даст возможность использовать героев в атаке пока те прокачиваются, вам не стоит играть в эту игру. Clash of Clans не должна быть вашей основной игры (конечно же из-за прокачки), но она может быть отличным дополнением к другим играм, вот только кач героев всё портит. И почему люди так жаждали увидеть 5 героя на 15 ратуше, я не понимаю.

Людям нравится Clash of Clans постоянным прогрессом, медленным, но всё же. Нажатие на сборщик/шахту сопровождается приятным звуком и пополнением запасов хранилища, большое количество различных наград, что заставляет тебя постоянно испытывать дофамин и эндорфин и вот ты уже становишься крысой с рычагом. Clash of Clans не должна быть вашей основной игрой.",4,10
metacritic,Milos_Crnac,clash-of-clans,"The game concept is pretty interesting and fun. You get a small base and you collect resources from mines and elixir collectors to upgrade it or trough raiding and attacking other players. Clan mechanic is also a good, you can chose to play alone, but in order to progress further faster, you will have to join a clan to get reinforcement troops and gain loot from clan battles. The game also get's updated regularly and with each major update, it's gets easier to level up buildings. It got to the point that buying gems to level up faster is no longer a viable solution. People these day's usually spend their gems on skins and magic items that help you to progress a lot faster for less gems than buying resources from shop. Even the gems are not to hard to earn. You can buy them, but you can also earn them by removing trees, collecting them from gem mine and completing achievement challenges. I earn around 70 gems per week and i never had a need to buy anything from the game shop other than maybe season pass, which has also a free version that has solid items. My point is, there is no need to buy microtransactions from the game shop, you can still level up reasonably fast and game has plenty of updates. My by far the biggest issue with this game is related to one of the core mechanics of the game: attacking the enemy bases. The game has plenty of troops to choose and many styles of attacking the other players. All of that is good, but the troop's AI is awful. It happened to me countless times that my troops attack something that they are not supposed to. AI of troops is very unpredictable and stupid, i feel like **** from half life have more advanced AI. This issue can kill all of the joy i have with this game and it really frustrates me. It is not rare for your troops to attack a mine that is located 8 tiles away instead of breaking a wall and attacking a cannon that is 2 tiles away from them, or for dragons, and other troops, to reach the center of base and then go to attack corner of base and destroy mines, barracks... For a game to have such issue that revolves around major game mechanic is unacceptable and supercell should really work on fixing this or to at least make troops a little bit more predictable. This is my major and probably only problem i have with this game. Other than that, the game is fun and i would recommend it but yeah, it does have problem and it really bothers me, and i'm sure i'm not the only one.",6,10

metacritic,JudePlaysGames,clash-of-clans,"So i have been playing this game 5-6  years and let me say this, when I began playing I was in love!
i played for so long going from town hall to town hall. that was on my old account and it was quite bad
(despite being th9)(also ""th"" is short for town hall) so I used my other account which is even better, anyways about the game.. you build a village using resources you collect and steal. this takes real life time and can range from 15 mins to 14 days. although the april 2019 made most upgrades shorter. of course you cant steal without troops so with barracks you can train troops and attack. you find someone elses village and place your troops, once all are placed watch them deal their destruction. Also you can be attacked too. now fighting may be simple but still amazing. so the main thing I want to say is, if your not patient, this may not be the game for you, but if you can deal with grinding and wating then get it, its free so try it out and see what its like

metacritic,YaBoiRoice,clash-of-clans,"I have played this game for about 4 years and still have interest in it, but I have a couple of criticisms:
1. The in-app purchases. I'm pretty sure I don't need to explain...
2. While, yes, I have played this game for a long time, I have had 3 or 4 periods of a couple of months without playing it. That's because after a while it gets REALLY repetitive and if you don't have any outside reasons to play the game (like a friend's or your clan) you are likely to lose interest in it in a maximum of a month. For me pretty much the only reason I'm still playing the game is the fact that a part of my friends plays it and we are building a clan together.
3. It can get really annoying in some occasions, especially when the troops do something incredibly stupid or you cannot find a good base to attack for 5 minutes
The new additions to the game have been great however, and it can be really fun to create your own community in the form of a clan with its own rules, requirements, etc.
3. It can be really annoying sometimes when your troops do something idiotic or you have to wait 5 minutes to find a base with nice loot to attack

Many strategy games use this technique, such as Age of Empires 2.

This game has quite a few positives to it like non-linear gameplay and the option to build your base however you want instead of the game predetermining it for you.  However, I think the negatives significantly tip the balance of the positives. Firstly, long wait timers. When you start everything will be built in seconds, but after that they will start taking HOURS and even up to FOURTEEN DAYS to build ONE thing. Unless you pay real money.
Also, it's supposed to be a ""strategy"" game but in a battle you CAN'T CONTROL YOUR TROOPS. So some of them go randomly wandering off to hit an Army Camp instead of the level 8 archer tower sniping them one by one and only a few troops have preferred targets so most of them just attack the nearest building. And once you finish a battle you will lose ALL the troops you used regardless whether they survived or not. The point is to use ""as few as possible"" but you don't go into a battle trying to ""use as few soldiers as possible"" to win do you?
The negatives really outweigh the positives.",4,10

Amazing to find people at 150+ level with 1000 cups or less attacking someone at level 100, and still doing a 0 raid.

metacritic,sleekpretender,clash-of-clans,"This game is no doubt the best game on both IOS and Android. Some people might say that this game is too boring because obviously it's too mainstream.

Building your own town and watching your troops destroy other's has a very sweet feel unto it. Because of its ethnicity to the games we played since we were kids (2000's) we kind of know what we are gonna do next and know what will happen next, but this game doesn't do that uh-uh.

metacritic,Gerrit210,clash-of-clans,"The first half of Clash of Clans is where you're starting the game and building your way up, pretty fun and addicting. Attacking villages and defending your own against other players is really good strategy, especially clan wars where you get to team up with other clan members and fight together to rise to the top. This is cool and all, the troops and spells are pretty good too, except for some of the wait times. After a while, the game starts to get boring and really tedious (around Town Hall 8/9 for me). Upgrades take too long, for troops and defense, very repetitive, there's no damn reason on why you should wait 2 weeks for a troop upgrade, like come on. They're just trying to get you to buy gems and use money while it's actually a free game to play. Very disappointing, I used to love this game, definitely one of my faves until things died down later on, now I just have no mood of playing it anymore. I'd give the first half around a 3.5/4, so about an 88/100. Later on, probably a 2/4, which is average.",6,10

WASTE of your time (seriously just buy a real game). Those who are not as dedicated decide to buy their way into the game. Either way money is flowing from the customers into the developers like honey.

The part that made it fall down for me was once you started to get a significant way through, everything just takes so long to do (waiting for building to be built/training troops etc), that you really are pushed to purchase gems.

Getting attacked you loose and eventually you get to a point where you loose from continuous attacks more than you can earn and the game become stale because you can only progress with any significance if you invest money.

This is a fantastic experience from start to finish, and left me continually floored at how it pulled me into its abstracted world, only for me to wish I could do it all over again with a blank mind once the credits rolled.

metacritic,verdienansein,outer-wilds,"Outer Wilds is a beautiful and unique gaming experience. It’s hard to describe—an exploration, adventure, and puzzle game with an incredible story that never holds your hand. I’ve never seen a game quite like it. I first played the base game, finishing it in around 25 hours, and then immediately dived into the DLC, Echoes of the Eye, for another 10 hours.

It’s difficult to talk about this game without spoiling it, but exploring the universe and uncovering its mysteries is an incredibly compelling experience. Every discovery feels rewarding, and each solved mystery leaves you in awe. I loved how exploration is entirely open-ended—you can approach it in so many ways and still manage to piece the story together. The fact that you could technically finish the game in just five minutes, with knowledge being the only barrier, is mind-blowing.

The game’s themes, especially its take on existentialism, are deeply moving and make the player feel emotionally attached to the journey. 

The soundtrack is absolutely beautiful—I still listen to it, and tracks like Travelers and the main theme of Echoes of the Eye are truly special. The ending is incredibly touching, and when the final music starts playing, it’s hard not to cry.I personally preferred the base game over the DLC. While Echoes of the Eye had some astounding reveals and a fantastic story, I wasn’t a fan of the stealth and horror elements, which felt a bit out of place to me.

Overall, I can say without a doubt that Outer Wilds is one of my favorite games, and I would recommend it to anyone. It’s not a game for everyone, but I believe everyone should at least give it a try.

5/5 - Masterpiece.",10,10
metacritic,LinManden,outer-wilds,"Outer Wilds made me cry, so intense was it. It is rewarding to play it through. Yes, sometimes I sought for help on the net, but I did not let anyone spoil the end.

The longest break lasted a whole year. But I always came back—no matter how long those pauses were—because I felt like there was something there worth exploring further. Worth all those frustrations. And wow, was I right. It’s not just a game; it’s almost poetry, an experience. A transformation. I had never seen something so well-written before. Game, movie, book—nothing. It’s beautiful. It makes you cry. It makes you feel utterly melancholic. Nothing had ever made me stare into the darkness quite like this.

metacritic,midna2003,outer-wilds,"Amazing open world game, where the thing you are exploring is history and knowledge of you galaxy. (Haven't played the DLC yet)

Pros:
-Player has complete freedom to explore the galaxy, thus everything you learn feels like you earned it yourself.
-Great story (both touching and from a hard sci-fi perspective)
-The game manages to elicit a real sense of danger and hostility of nature, without any fighting
-Great score
-Every bit of history and natural law you learn about is just so satisfying
-Very cool planets
-Really makes you feel like an archeologist/explorer

Neutral:
-You will need to visit the same place several times, which requires travelling there for a couple of minutes. While this can be a bit frustrating, it also makes the whole adventure feel difficult and that adversity does add something positive.

Cons:
- Since there is minimal/no hand holding, you can get stuck. This can throw off the pacing of the game.",10,10
metacritic,creastez,outer-wilds,"É delicado falar sobre uma obra tão impactante quanto Outer Wilds. Acho que nunca experienciei algo que capturasse o vazio e o fim de maneira tão poética e realista. Normalmente, ao terminar um jogo, há um momento para refletir sobre a jornada percorrida, revisitando memórias e feitos. Em Outer Wilds, porém, essa pausa nunca acontece. O jogo não permite que você respire. Um instante você está emocionado, fungando o nariz, e no seguinte, está simplesmente parado, encarando a tela, absorvendo o que acabou de acontecer. Até os créditos carregam um peso surreal — é o tipo de experiência em que, quando termina, é difícil acreditar que acabou. E Outer Wilds realmente acaba, em todos os sentidos possíveis. O fim é inevitável, mas a transformação ocorre na forma como você decide encará-lo.

O mais curioso é como o jogo entrega um universo vasto e aberto para ser explorado, apenas para, nos minutos finais, fazer você compreender o real significado de sua jornada. Porque existir vai muito além dos conceitos que consideramos simples, e Outer Wilds ilustra isso de forma brilhante. Passar horas explorando planetas visualmente incríveis, repletos de informações sobre a história do sistema solar e suas teorias, apenas para perceber que o esforço sempre foi sobre uma ideia maior — arriscar tudo por algo incerto, sem garantias. 

A história nunca foi sobre você. Mas, paradoxalmente, sem você, ela não existiria. É uma obra que transcende as expectativas de um jogo e se torna uma meditação sobre existência, significado e a beleza do desconhecido.",10,10

It's puzzles are a perfect balance of challenging, yet solvable, and give a sense of satisfaction greater than any puzzle game I've played. While the movement has a learning curve it, like everything else in the game, rewards experimentation and gives a deep sense of mastery when you learn it.

Outer Wilds creates a real sense of danger despite having no combat. It evokes real and strong emotions through it's unmatched score and sound design.

I just don't have the time anymore.

All the while I was thinking, wouldn't it be cool if this was a more ""traditional"" game instead? And that game exists, it's Majora's Mask (hard to recommend because of the dated graphics maybe)

This is a game somehow more thematic than a movie, truly not allowing for replayability as if you've beaten the game before, you will be able to beat the game again in about three minutes. This is fine, as the reason for both this and the fact that not everyone ""gets"" the game is the same. This reason is that the game isn't driven by skill or by strategy, but by knowledge. There is no game like Outer Wilds and I urge you to try it and try not to get spoiled as since the game so heavily relies on knowledge, spoilers ruin the game more than they ruin other games or movies. Everything from music to art, to design, to writing, to worldbuilding is immaculate in this game and I cannot think **** better than this.",10,10
metacritic,Lottow,outer-wilds,"A game that can be anything between a repetitive death simulation and a unforgettable experience.
When i first played the game i felt that i gave it more than a fair chance, but after playing it for several hours past the point where i wanted to give up, i just accepted that the game was ""very overrated"" and i stopped playing it. After a bit of googling i noticed a lot of people shared my experience with the game, yet any criticism was met with ""The game is just not for you"". Seems a lot of the Outer Wilds fans out there are not at all receptive to any kind of complaints about the game.

Fast forward to a year later when i stubbornly decided to give the game another chance (after already giving it more of a chance than i would with any other game), and im glad i did, cause somehow the second playthrough just clicked. Instead of being an endless death simulator with little meaning, things connected in a way that they did not do at all my first time playing. It was like playing a completely different game, and i have to say it really is a pretty fantastic game at that.

From my first experience with the game i think its clear that random choices and decisions can have a huge impact on the overall experience with the game. Things like exploring places that you are ""supposed to"" reach later, banging your head against a wall trying to reach areas you know of but cant figure out how to reach, dying to traps you dont know how to handle, trying to solve problems without knowing that you are in fact missing the most important clue. you just have so much freedom, which is probably one of the best and worst things about the game at the same time.

All in all i will still give a strong recommendation to give it a try, especially if you like games like Subnautica or The Forgotten City. 
And if you are struggling the way i did, try not to get too fixated with fully solving certain problems or reaching certain areas before just moving on to a different area or planet.",8,10

Although many reviews say that the time loop is very short, I think thats the main mechanic of the game. It would be quite boring to pass it on in one go, quickly and without notice those little details that make the game so beautiful and unique.
Another thing many reviews say is that they loose track on the clues. Honestly, I find that a skill isue, stop being a crybaby and work for the reward, earn it, thats the main reason to why the spaceship has a record of all you have discovered.
You can finish the game even if you don't have all the clues.

metacritic,louisreas,outer-wilds,"This is one of those games that your opinion on is entirely dictated by whether or not you like being told where to go, or would rather be thrown into a world where you have to find clues to progress, for me, it was simply frustrating not being to progress after a certain point, I had to pull up a guide to get through certain puzzles, at that point, I realized the game is simply not made for me, or for anyone who doesn't like spending a long time on a single puzzle rereading clues like a detective out of an 80s show trying to have a eureka moment, however, one thing which I know no one in their right mind would enjoy is the annoyingly short loop time, which contradicts the point of the game, which is slow exploration, overall, the game is simply not for  everyone.

But it is certainly not for everyone and far from perfect. 
My main issues are the wonky controls and the at times very frustrating gameplay loop. 
When i got stuck over a long period of time, it made me stop wanting to play the game for weeks sometimes.
But every time i managed to progress and discover new things i got really addicted and was salivating for more. 
The same mechanics that at times were intensely frustrating made the game sometimes incredibly exiting.
The music and artdesign are really great. 
Both combined created a very unique and immersive atmosphere for me. 
Sometimes everything is in its right place and it can really hit hard. 

Overall Outer Wilds is one of the most unique gaming expiriences i've ever had.
If you like games based on exploration and space i would give this game a try.",8,10
metacritic,Orion78,outer-wilds,"Que dire, un de mes grandes claques de ces dernières années. Ce jeu a tellement de points positif tout d'abord la musique, le thème des astronautes du programme Odyssey reste en tête longtemps après avoir finit le jeu et donne un ton nostalgique dès le début de l'aventure, cette musique est magnifiquement sublimé avec la scène de fin qui est pleine d'espoir et non triste comme je m'y attendais. Ensuite le deuxième très grand point fort du jeu c'est bien sûr les énigmes qui sont magnifiquement construites, avoir créé un jeu de piste de la taille d'un système solaire est une prouesse que je trouve remarquable et de plus l'histoire des Nomais m'a vraiment passionné et poussé à chercher toujours plus loin. 
Mais je voudrai soulever deux points négatifs que je trouve au jeu, tout d'abord le chrono m'a poussé a des nombreuses reprises à juste courir le plus vite possible en ratant des objectifs et en passant à côté d'information important qui aurait pu m'aider. Et le point noir du jeu est pour moi la planète gravité que je ne porte pas dans mon coeur de part son centre qui peut détruire des explorations si tu ne vas pas assez vite ou si tu rates tes sauts.

This experience is unique and if someone tells you they found the perfect game to replace outer wilds after you've done it, they're lying, this is the most beautiful game i know (and i played Hollow knight) and the most accessible game.

metacritic,TheDracon,outer-wilds,"Outer Wilds is not for everyone. For some people, this game may seem frustrating or boring, but that is because this game is not to be played in a hurry. It truly isn't about the destination, I myself didn't even want to finish the game, because I knew I could not play it again.

This game has mixed and negative reviews because it definitely isn't for everyone, but it definitely is worth trying.

This game is a one time experience that everyone should try to play, calmly. Play it in your free time, when you have nothing else to do. If you get stuck in a puzzle or part of the game, don't force it, just take a break from the game, go do something else, and return later.
The storytelling is absolutely awesome, the way you realize what is happening, no matter the order in which you get the little peaces of information is incredible, the way you realize at points of the game that you knew nothing all along. 

Must play (must try).

Truly a masterpiece. 10/10",10,10
metacritic,sakalipsa,outer-wilds,"There is simply no other game that better illustrates the essential importance of three fundamental elements of the species we are part of: wonder, curiosity, knowledge. This is what games should be all about. I remember reading Borges' diary a long time ago, and there is one particular passage where he summarizes all the moments he listens to Mozart after some time and always has the same realization afterward: only THAT music was all he ever needed and sought from his core, of which he was completely oblivious during periods of listening to music from his own era. The same goes for books or movies, fields which are filled up with immense trash today. Not to mention music. It takes just one good dive into roots to resonate with all the archetypes within your individuality that will evoke all the ""spirits"" of your kind, profoundly fulfilling you as if you're part of something eternal, something higher than oneself. It's what ART is all about. It's not activism or a political discourse or any ideology that comes from your era and others' intentions to subtly or obviously affect reality in a modifying manner to consolidate their tendencies and profits, no... It's an ""escape pod"" in the bramble of our most feared enemy - mortality, it is a ""distress beacon"" of our ancestral kind that easily defeats it by transcending time, it's a set of coordinates that warp you to the location you've always been but remained oblivious about it your whole life...Until you press play.",10,10

It is also breath takingly beautiful, the world is so well built and alive, it doesn't matter whether you are there to see it or not, it will happen.

The history is so well built and interesting that i could go for hours talking about it, and the dlc only makes it better, so it definitely worthwhile.

Play this. I can recommend it to everyone. It doesn't matter if you are experienced in gaming or not, everyone can enjoy it, but i would recommend that you play it when you feel like it, cause this is an experience so good and you will not have abother chance once you finish it, so don't rush it.",10,10

The way the developer creates a planet with a unique idea and runs wild with it is absolutely admirable. I love the way info on planets intertwine and how learning the history of each one is the end goal. The point of outer wilds is to spike curiosity and make you value the things you have in life. In summary, this is one of those games I beg others to at least try. Don’t get me wrong, this isn’t a game for anyone.

Unfortunately, you can find yourself get into ruts and kind of just spinning gears at times and it can be a bit frustrating. Some of the planets are fairly large so getting just a finite time to check them out you might find yourself rushing a bit.

Over time, you'll start to unveil the mysteries of this particular reality and have a clearer purpose.

metacritic,something420,hotline-miami,"This game is great for several reasons, particularly its stellar soundtrack, which I consider S-tier. I play it all the time, and it was honestly the main reason I got into the game in the first place. The gameplay is another highlight—addictive, fast-paced, and delightfully frantic. Although you die in one hit (unless you take someone hostage), the quick respawn system keeps it from being frustrating. The story is also worth mentioning, as it delves into our relationship with violence, a thought-provoking and forward-thinking concept for its time. Additionally, the graphics are timeless; even though the game was released in 2012, its pixel-art style has aged beautifully and still looks fantastic today. 

However, the game is not without its flaws. Every moment that isn’t focused on the core second-to-second gameplay feels like a chore. For example, the boss fights are more like glorified puzzles than actual fights. They lack engaging decision-making, and once you figure out their patterns, they become mere roadblocks rather than exciting challenges. This feels like a missed opportunity, especially given how excellent the base gameplay is. Another issue is the size of some levels, particularly toward the end of the game. Their sprawling design often results in getting shot by enemies you didn’t even know existed, which can feel cheap and frustrating. On top of that, restarting a level forces you to sit through repeated dialogue, making the frequent deaths more annoying than they need to be.

Despite its shortcomings, this game is a unique experience I wholeheartedly recommend. Its highs outweigh its lows, and there’s truly nothing else like it on the market. Even the sequel couldn’t replicate the magic that this game captured.",9,10
metacritic,Paentimexi,hotline-miami,"Exceptional. It's quick, raw, and brutal; yet methodical, clean, and vibrant. Outstanding in every way, and it’s one of my personal favorites.",10,10
metacritic,tbruh,hotline-miami,"Hotline Miami's a game focusing centrally on the concept of violence, both in games and in real life. This is delivered in a neon 80s package with some good tunes and a tasteful bit of gore, if by tasteful you mean a full 5 course meal.
The gameplay is the big selling point of the game. Hotline Miami is a weird mix of a top down shooter, stealth, strategy and (vaguely) puzzle  game. Dying in game is less of a failure and more of just a necessary part of winning. The game encourages trying over and over until you find a perfect route or perfect mask that allows you to proceed to the next stage.
The gameplay loop is scout out, die, scout out further, die, kill the guy who killed you the first 2 times, scout out, die, kill the guy and his mate your now aware of, clear stage, onto the next.
It's a repetitive loop, sure, and definitely gets frustrating on later levels, but it is pretty fun regardless. The unfairness is definitely intentional. Being shot at from beyond the screen is simply a lesson to be careful in open sightlines. Learning the enemy A.I, knowing when to shoot a gun or throw it for a silent takedown, clearing a room now or leaving it for later, it all serves to gamify violence down to a science - perfectly encapsulating the games main theme.
I won't spoil the story for Hotline Miami, but surreal doesn't begin to cut it. It's the kind of story that leaves you thinking ""Wait what? That's it?"", then ""Really, that's all it was?"" when you complete the epilogue, and then a resounding ""Ohhh..."" once your watch a youtube long form video about it or a 13 year old reddit post. Ironically, having this messy, left-in-the-dark story telling serves the narrative too. Does it matter why you're doing it? It's fun right? Why stop and think now? In the story centred missions, I found myself wondering when I would go back to the action - unknowingly playing right into the games hands. 
The main things that hold me back from scoring this game higher are repetitive/luck based gameplay and the general buggy-ness. In the end, the best strategy was to hide around corners and shoot with the mask that silences your weapon. And though the enemy A.I is not meant to be the most sophisticated, the way that they interact with doors (especially the dogs) has gotten me unfairly killed many times. Plus, the story, though good on later ponderings, isn't super enthralling by itself and takes supplementary material to be fully appreciated. 
If your considering playing this game, ask yourself this first. Do you like to hurt people? Including yourself? If the answers yes, then go play it.",7,10

metacritic,something420,hotline-miami-2-wrong-number,"Man, where do I even begin with this game?

To start, the soundtrack of this game surpasses even the original's, earning a place as one of my favorite OSTs of all time. The story is impressively crafted, serving as a prequel, midquel, and sequel simultaneously. This ambitious narrative structure could easily have fallen flat, but the game executes it masterfully. Additionally, the game expands significantly on the lore of *Hotline Miami*, which is a detail I deeply appreciate. The non-chronological storytelling adds an intriguing layer, as you might play one level set in 1991 and the next in 1985. The characters are a notable improvement over the first game, benefiting from the increased story focus. As for the gameplay, it retains the addictive quality of the original, with the added bonus of a wider variety of playable characters, each offering unique and enjoyable differences. The inclusion of a level editor and workshop support is another fantastic addition that enhances the overall experience. 

However, the level design leaves much to be desired. Many levels in this game suffer from frustrating design elements that resemble the worst parts of the original. They tend to be excessively large with numerous sightlines, making it easy to be killed by unseen enemies. The game encourages a fast-paced, aggressive playstyle but punishes it with this type of level design, forcing players to slow down and bait out enemies instead. This approach is counterintuitive to the game’s scoring system. Notable offenders include levels such as Dead Ahead, Death Wish, Casualties, Demolition, Release, and Takeover, which are particularly frustrating. While the characters’ unique abilities are a fun concept, they are not all equally effective. For example, the dodge roll shared by Corey and the Son is often difficult to use and counterproductive when trying to execute enemies. The boss fights, while slightly better than in the first game due to their reduced prominence, remain repetitive. 

To wrap this up, it is easy to understand why this game has generated so much controversy. While it makes significant strides in storytelling and character development, it takes a step back in gameplay compared to the first game. Despite these flaws, I would still recommend the game to fans of the original. However, if you’re easily frustrated, this game might not be for you, as the increased difficulty means you’ll die much more often. Looking ahead, I hope Dennaton Games will create another title that captures the compelling gameplay of the Hotline Miami duology while improving on its weaker aspects.",8,10

metacritic,MrRecorder2008,hotline-miami-2-wrong-number,"Hotline Miami 2: Wrong Number, released in 2015, is a game that refuses to pull punches. This sequel to the critically acclaimed Hotline Miami takes everything that made the original great and amplifies it, resulting in an even more intense, challenging, and provocative experience that is not for the faint of heart. The game's narrative picks up from where the first Hotline Miami left off, weaving a complex and fragmented storyline that delves deeper into the disturbing world of masked killers, conspiracy, and madness. It's a narrative that is intentionally abstract and open to interpretation, encouraging players to piece together the puzzle themselves. Hotline Miami 2's gameplay maintains the fast-paced, top-down, one-hit-kill combat that made the original a cult classic. However, it introduces a variety of new characters, each with their own unique abilities and weapons. This diversity adds depth to the gameplay, requiring players to adapt to different playstyles and challenges. The level design is meticulously crafted, offering a mix of tight corridors, open spaces, and intricate layouts that demand quick thinking and precision. The soundtrack, much like its predecessor, is an electrifying mix of pulsating synthwave and dark, atmospheric tunes that perfectly complement the game's frenetic action. The game's difficulty is unrelenting, often requiring trial-and-error and lightning-fast reflexes to succeed. The feeling of satisfaction that comes from mastering a level after numerous failures is a testament to its well-crafted design. Hotline Miami 2 does not shy away from controversial and provocative themes. It explores violence, nihilism, and the consequences of actions in a brutal and unflinching manner. While this approach may not appeal to everyone, it adds depth to the game's narrative and provokes thought. One of the game's strengths is its level editor, which allows players to create and share their own levels and campaigns. This feature has led to a wealth of user-generated content, extending the game's lifespan and providing endless challenges. However, some players may find the game's extreme difficulty and often punishing trial-and-error gameplay frustrating. The narrative's abstract nature can also be divisive, as it leaves much open to interpretation. In conclusion, Hotline Miami 2: Wrong Number is a brutal, uncompromising sequel that pushes the limits of both gameplay and storytelling. It takes everything that made the original great and amplifies it, resulting in an intense and challenging experience. While it may not be for everyone due to its controversial themes and difficulty, it remains a standout title for those seeking an unapologetically provocative and action-packed gaming experience.",9,10

metacritic,Sepherim,hotline-miami-2-wrong-number,"Hotline Miami 2 no es exactamente un mal juego, pero si que es un empeoramiento con respecto al primero. La razón de ello es sencilla: decedieron innovar (¡genial!) pero no les salió bien. La apuesta de jugabilidad base es igual a la del primero, con mayor variedad de enemigos, armas y situaciones. Hasta ahí genial, si bien a veces se sobrecarga un poco de bosses y algunas cosas que no salen tan bien. El problema es que ya no hay máscaras y cuando puedes escoger es de modo limitado, lo cual facilita el diseño de niveles pero a la vez quita libertad al jugador a la hora de experimentar y probar cosas según su estilo de juego. Y sobretodo el fallo está en darle más peso a la historia. La historia del 1º era mala y sin demasiado sentido pero al menos no ocupaba demasiado tiempo; en este caso sin embargo la historia es igual de mala y sin sentido, pero ocupa mucho más tiempo de pantalla con cosas que no interesan, rompiendo el ritmo de juego.

Gráficamente es pobre, como lo era el primero, no notándose mejoría alguna entre uno y otro. El sonido sigue en la línea del anterior, también tirando a pobre. Pero, al menos en mi experiencia, no me he encontrado ningún bug de importancia, aunque la IA de los enemigos es tremendamente errática y a veces ven cosas que no deberían y otras no ven lo que tienen frente a ellos.

The story was a cryptic bizzaro tale which can be pieced together if you pay close attention to the details and characters but that doesn't  make it a good story it just makes it a decent one in my eyes. The gameplay is the same as the previous one which is mostly mastering the level layout and enemy AI by dying repeatably until you do , sadly a lot of it was ruined by bugs and sometimes a slower input on the controls. You can often get stuck on walls or doors for example and you might be required to restart the entire level all over again which can piss you off since some levels are pretty hard to beat.",6,10

metacritic,Baltifru,hotline-miami-2-wrong-number,"Hotline Miami 2 is for me the perfect complement to the first episode.

It kept the essentials that made Hotline Miami so unique: a simple yet intense, nervous, gory gameplay enhanced by bigger maps; an excellent OST; and a very dark atmosphere. This last aspect was pushed much further in this episode, with many more characters all psychopathic in their own way: the cutscenes illustrate their schizophrenia and taste for violence very creepily. This is a real demonstration of how intense and shocking a game with seemingly simple artistic design can be.

Together with this incredible atmosphere, there is another aspect of Hotline Miami 2 that makes it reach a new height: its scenario. Although it required to play the whole game, the first episode revealed a well-thought scenario that was the pinnacle of the game. However, the scenario of this episode is much deeper, with interconnections with the first episodes, new incredible revelations, and multiple scenes and details that one might even not notice at first play, but bring answers to different questions. It was clearly too much for me to catch everything in one go, but reading the wiki of the game helped me clarified some brilliant details of the scenario.

metacritic,POstAL_QueeN,hotline-miami-2-wrong-number,"Достойное продолжение, которое тоже втягивает тебя во всю эту эпопею безумия полностью. Прошло очень много времени и все могло поменяться в лучшую или худшую сторону. Это зависит от насущных обстоятельств. Но твой разум и мысли не поменялись, в подсознании остается все, и это все дает о себе знать в нужный момент. Когда оно выходит, приходится вернуться к старому и начать совершать вещи. Я не говорю конкретно какие вещи, потому что это судить не мне, и далеко не многим. Это судить надо самому исполнителю. Ведь осознание - это в большинстве случаев решение. Нахождение истины, позволяет определить правильный путь. И в данном случаи понять, сущность вещей. Их намерения и важность в бытие. Поможет ли это тебе, или наоборот убьет. Но побочный эффект тоже может быть не утешительный, ведь нужно будет принять во внимания всю ту накопленную грязь, не каждому это под силу.

Hotline Miami 2: Wrong Number - это банальное психоделическое продолжение безумия. И это как раз таки то, что и нужно было. Эта банальщина сделала все как надо. Без нее не получился бы второй шедевр. Игра затягивает, так же как и первая часть. У меня были остаточные чувства (даже больше тревожные), что игра не получиться, ей не удастся опередить успех первой части. Но как я начал играть, я все прекрасно понял. Этой игре и не надо кого-то опережать, особенно первую часть. Ей наоборот надо быть посредственной, что и стало в итоге ключом к совершенству. Стараться кого-то опередить - это может привести в некоторых аспектах к подражанию, может это слегка и заметно в этой игре, но простота возвышает свой образ выше. Это форма и является достойным продолжением.

Ты как будто никуда и не перемещался, но также ощущаешь новый психоделический мир. И из подсознания возвращаются знания об убийстве, об цели убивать. И без сомнений приступаешь к делу. Нового на самом деле тут много, но оно хорошо скрыто, и так должно быть. Ты вроде опять должен убивать, но история совершенно новая. Ты двигаешься по новому задуманному сюжету, который приведет тебя к неоднозначному финалу. И на протяжении всего пути ты должен убивать, оставлять за собой гору трупов. Я считаю это центром игры, в ней нашли изюминку для реализации чего-то большего. И если говорит в обширном понимании, то это нечто большее - посредственность. Иногда не надо запредельно думать, надо смотреть на более ближние варианты. Которые вроде бы под носом, но их не видно. Разработчики сделали все верно, это и есть качество креативности, иногда надо думать просто.

Я по прежнему считаю это вторым шедевром, но это все таки сиквел. Пускай это будет максимум для сиквелов, хотя я думаю что это одно из лучших продолжений. Я искренне полюбил эту игру, так же как и первую, хоть и думал что получится совершенно иначе...",9,10

metacritic,SamJBarn,super-mario-bros-wonder,"Look, after years of copy-pasted New Super Mario Bros platformers, it's hard to complain too much about Super Mario Bros Wonder. The entire central conceit is built around solving the central criticism: 2D Mario games have become derivative. And indeed, playing through the game is a breezy joy. The art style is top-notch, the new enemy designs are fantastic, and some of the Wonder Seed moments are truly inspired. 

That said, I can't help but feel like the game builds a solid foundation for Mario's future, but doesn't quite feel like the future itself. It introduces a lot of fun elements but doesn't push it to quite the next level as we might be used to from Mario's 3D games. I think a perfect example are the new power-ups, namely the elephant and the drill. Both are so much fun to use, but feel surprisingly limited in what they allow you to do. Even compared with the cape from Super Mario World, let alone the moveset from the 3D games, it just feel like the player is as empowered as they should be to play around with these new tools. I will also say that I found the Wonder Seeds to be a bit hit-or-miss. Some of them are so clever and fun that others can't help but feel like missed opportunities in comparison. 

For my money, the best new element are the badges that meaningfully change up the way you control these characters. This is exactly the kind of freedom of choice I wish there was more of from the other features of the game. But even here, I get the sense that the development team could have pushed the limits a bit more, perhaps peppering levels with secret paths based on which badges you used. This certainly would have helped with replay-ability, because as it is the game is too brief and most levels aren't so inspired as to compel you to go through them again unless you are already a compulsive completionist.

There are other gripes here and there -- other than the final level the game is not the least bit challenging -- but it's important to restate that any fan of Mario and platformers in general should still play this game. It is a step in the right direction and a lovely experience to binge through in a weekend or two. The art style and animation in particular deserves all the praise in the world. It's just one of those experiences where I spent a lot of my playtime dreaming about what the sequel will do.",7,10

metacritic,Deebsopinion,super-mario-bros-wonder,"Super Mario Wonder review:Super Mario Wonder is one of those games that i feel like i would enjoy more if i was younger. I also feel like it's an overrated game. it's a fine game but people were hyping it up to be way more than it was. Here's my full review 10/10The graphics in super mario wonder are awesome. i love all the visual effects they just look so crisp. the new art style nintendo went for is definitely more kiddy feeling but i think it looks really good. It has a unique feeling unlike any other mario game. the models also look really nice. also everything in the game fits together perfectly aesthetically. Controls: 9/10I don't have too much to say about the controls. they are really good idk what i would change but they don't feel ""perfect"". i would say the only issue is the rumble. this game has way too much of it imo but thats just my opinion and i turned it off.Power ups: 8.5/10The power ups in this game brought back some of the usual being the fire flower but introduced cool new ones like the drill power up and the bubble flower which add new ways to control and attack with mario and i really appreciate that. i only wish they brought back some more old power ups like the tanuki suit or ice flower.World map: 8/10The world map in this game is pretty good and has a lot of areas where you can pay to unlocked more levels or areas of the map and that's unique to this game and a really cool concept. definitely also enjoy the 3d freedom of the world map. only issue is sometimes the world map is confusing.Level design: 8/10Level design in this game is really good and has really cool gimicks never seen before.overall one of the most creative games of them all. however sometimes while the gimmicks are new and unique they just don't feel fun like other mario games i played as a kid did. it just doesn't have that feeling. also i didn't like how sometimes you had to go to the flagpole just to realize you didn't find a secret wonder flower so you don't get the seeds for that playthrough.Gameplay: 7.5overall gameplay is really good and the highlights include wonder flower, slime level.overall rating 8.2/10 it's a great 2D Mario game but imo overrated. I loved the art style and controls but there are several flaws and it doesn't give me the same vibes as other 2D Mario games did.",8,10
metacritic,Kokosnusseis,super-mario-bros-wonder,"Unfortunately, I must say that I am disappointed given the price the game demands.First of all, the level design is quite appealing. The graphics and creative environments immediately draw you into Mario's world. However, the game falls short in terms of content. The challenge is overall very low, which significantly detracts from the gaming experience.Another major point of criticism is the boss battles. These are not only unimaginative but also disappointingly easy to defeat. With a playtime of only 8-10 hours, I find the price-to-value ratio unjustifiable.",5,10

Levels feel barren and empty without the wonder seeds, and the platforming is brain dead. The wonder seeds become very predictable after the first few levels, and the ideas they introduce are never expanded upon. Ideas are abandoned as soon as they are introduced,  and it feels as if tiktok was a video game. Also, the controls are a general downgrade from the previous entry in the series, as Mario's signature momentum based controls are abandoned in favor of megaman style controls, where the character can change directions at a whim and instantly be going at max speed in that direction.",0,10
metacritic,Dog_Boy,super-mario-bros-wonder,I constantly forget how good **** this is. it's easily one of the best nintendo platformers of all time. only bad part is most of the basses are bowser jr and some worlds don't have a boss. the final level is fun as it has a unique and fun gimmick.,9,10

metacritic,Ghavallux,super-mario-bros-wonder,"This game is, in my opinion, the best 2D Super Mario game since Super Mario World, and is by far my Top 3 2D Mario Games of all time. Super Mario Bros. Wonder is super creative in many aspects like the art-style is really cute and gives new life to these beloved characters making them more expressive than ever while making the game really colorful and appealing to the eyes. The new mechanics like the badges really offers some new variety in gameplay with each having different properties but never taking away from the core gameplay loop, and the Wonder Effect is really weird, but in a good way, where the game kicks up the tempo and offers some creative level changes and some transformations that change up the gameplay. The music is super lively and upbeat with many styles of music for each varying level and world that fits with each setting, and is also really catchy. The level design is super top notch, each offering new enemies, challenges, and secrets to find and are fun to breeze through. The replay value is very high and completion is challenging but fun as well with online multiplayer, if there are any complaints, I say the bosses, aside from the final boss, are  a bit disappointing considering the games creativity and the fact that not all worlds end with a boss is strange, and maybe a few of the challenge levels, specifically the finding the purple coins levels, tend to get too tedious and annoying. Overall the game focuses on the gameplay and creativity, while offering new ideas that keep you engaged and surprised at every turn. I highly recommend getting this game.",9,10

metacritic,Maks1235,super-mario-bros-wonder,"WOW. Another example besides Super Mario Odyssey of what a wonderful game comes out when Nintendo pours their heart and soul and passion into it. This game greatly benefits with the idea of going to a whole new kingdom, revealing a plethora of new characters and creative fun enemies. The 3D landscapes and world map is some of the best I've ever seen. This game also further makes it much less stale by adding 3 brand new and original power-ups, which are arguably the best power-ups in the whole Mario series. The Wonder Flower makes for a wonderful twist in the level and makes you expect the unexpected with usually having an amazing and fun change to the level. Oh, and the talking flowers make this game really feel less lonely and more like your with someone. This game also greatly benefits with online / couch co-op, as I had a great time with my brother. The only reason this game is a 9 and not a 10 is due to the boss fights. While the final boss was very fun, you will soon realise that all the bosses are just Bowser Jr, with some worlds even ditching the idea of a boss, which I think is cool but I don't like how more than 1 world does it. Would highly recommend 9/10",9,10

The game is extremely fun to play with unique new enemies, and game mechanics. My only downside is that the game is a bit on the easy side, but it is fantastic.",9,10
metacritic,Fmergitude,super-mario-bros-wonder,"THE GOOD:
The aesthetics are to die for and I just love how the game looks and feels to play. The new types of levels are innovative and interesting. Must play if you love Mario games for the style.

FRUSTRATING NEW MECHANICS
The new types of levels are only fun to play once and by my second play-through I wished there were less of them. In the end it feel more like a collection of mini games with some platformers sprinkled in

MUCH TOO EASY
The platforming in this game is far too easy. The problem is that the 'experimental' levels can be difficult because of its rough mechanics. (e.g you can expect to get stuck on the 'searching' levels which isn't fun at all). You can play as characters who don't take damage, which was probably added to even the difficulty for children, but the levels with enemies are already too easy as they are. my problem is this: an easy game isn't necessarily bad, because then I'd recommend it to children, but children will get stuck on the 'experimental' levels. An older brother would probably have to be on hand to help with some of the search levels in particular.

BAD FOR COUCH PLAY
I used to play the NewSup games with my brothers, but you can't do that with this game. The screen always follows P1, which always frustrates other players who die by not keeping up. Also, the new types of levels and wonder parts are just impossible with friends, because the mechanics don't translate and other people are plain confused.

CONCLUSION
This game is both beautiful and frustrating. There is not enough focus on platforming for a platformer game. If you've played any other Mario games you'll find it much too easy. Easy usually means good for coop or kids, but this game isn't. It's too easy to recommend for adults, and too confusing to recommend for kids or friends. I recommend this game to you if you want to play a work of art, and are open to all the creative elements. If you want a repayable, living room classic, look elsewhere.",8,10

metacritic,ThorA320FR,super-mario-bros-wonder,"This game is a masterful blend of nostalgia and innovation, offering a fresh take on the classic 2D Mario formula.
The game beautifully captures the essence of classic Mario visuals while introducing a creative touch with new obstacles and vibrant animations.
The controls are flawlessly responsive, delivering the hallmark precision that Mario games are known for. Every jump and action feels perfectly tuned, making gameplay engaging and enjoyable throughout the game.
One of the standout features is the introduction of a badge system, offering unique abilities that significantly enhance gameplay. This mechanic is well-implemented and adds a layer of strategy and new mechanics.
The levels are a perfect mix of variety and challenge. Some are easy and accessible, while others provide a tougher test of skill. The ability to choose levels in an open-world style, similar to Mario Odyssey, adds a sense of freedom and exploration.
While the storyline doesn't stray far from the familiar ""save the kingdom from Bowser"" plot, it works well within the Mario universe. Notably, Princess Peach doesn't take center stage this time.
There is no multiplayer mode, but the game stands strong as a single-player experience.
The soundtrack is a soothing, nostalgic delight that perfectly complements the gameplay. It takes you back to classic Mario tunes while introducing new melodies that fit seamlessly into the Mario world.
The game offers strong replay value through time trials and the challenge of uncovering hidden seeds across levels. These features encourage players to revisit levels and strive for 100% completion.
The difficulty is well-balanced, providing just the right level of challenge to keep players invested without causing unnecessary frustration.
Playing Super Mario Bros. Wonder is a joyful experience from start to finish. The end credits sequence is particularly original.
In a nutshell, Super Mario Bros. Wonder is a must-play for Mario fans and newcomers alike. It combines classic gameplay with fresh mechanics, excellent level design, and a delightful soundtrack.
The experience it offers is nothing short of wonderful. 10/10",10,10

metacritic,MovieReject,super-mario-bros-wonder,"I purchased Super Mario Wonder the day it came out for Switch. I’ll be completely honest, the first few levels in World 1 (Pipe-Rock Plateau) I felt like I was getting into just “another” Mario game. I put it off to the side and forgot about it. It wasn’t until recently I gave it another shot, and boy was I wrong with my first impression of the game. I cannot put it down! The level designs are absolutely breathtaking, along with all the cool animations when you find a Wonder Seed and the boss fights are visually amazing. The mechanics are by far the best I’ve ever played in a Super Mario game. This game has made me appreciate my Nintendo Switch even more, I seriously cannot get enough of it!
The online feature is something else I’m very impressed with. I love that you can see other players in the same level as you, and you can also see them wandering around the map between levels. If you die, your character’s ghost has the ability to swim to another player where they can revive you, if you can get to them in time that is. The “Standees” are a really cool feature as well. They are these cool little character signs you can place within levels to show “I was here”. Other players can hit the Standee to activate it. If you happen to die and there are no other players around to revive you, you can swim over to the last Standee you activated, and come back to life right away, that’s if you get to it in time though. 
Overall, this game should have won game of the year in my opinion! It has everything for everyone, and it’s such a beautiful game to experience. I don’t write many game reviews, but I had to share my thoughts on this one because it’s the most fun I’ve had playing switch in a really long time. Being a Super Mario fan for 35 years, Super Mario Bros. Wonder is the most fun I’ve had playing a Mario game since Super Mario 3 and Super Mario World as a kid! If you’re a fan of Super Mario, you won’t be disappointed, that I can definitely vouch for! If you have a Nintendo Switch, this is the game everyone should play at least once.",10,10
metacritic,Luigi2025,super-mario-bros-wonder,This game feels like a panting from a wonderful artist from the art gallery. the gameplay is amazing the design of the characters and the background gives me stop motion vibes. and I love it the voices is great the levels is so creative it feels like a 8 year old got the ideas and it's amazing. and it's not Bland or boring and a cash grab like new super Mario bros series. So I gave it 10/10,10,10
metacritic,NicoDaChippo,super-mario-bros-wonder,"Super Mario Bros. Wonder is a great and much needed addition to the Super Mario Bros. series. With new twists like the wonder flowers, art style and voice acting it provides a fresh new look on the series that is a major improvement. Based upon the past few entries to the series being lacklustre, boring and unoriginal the game may seem like it’s a holy grail game, but there are a few downsides. I found that the difficulty scaling was a bit off as there would be a level where I could breeze through then the next one it could take up to an hour to beat (I do think there is a possibility of some skill issues though). I also found the game to be quite tedious at times but I think having the wonder flowers and badges really didn’t make it that much of an issue. One part I absolutely loved was the Badge system, I found some to be very useful and it added a spin to every level. Although weird I found that one of the most fun parts of the game to be the credits! So I would push through to the end just to play that. Overall, I would say Super Mario Bros. Wonder is a worthwhile game to play especially if your interested in playing a 2D Mario game. It is a shorter game but not in comparison to the rest of the series but still worth the price.",8,10

metacritic,JoeySTRIKE,super-mario-bros-wonder,"Super Mario Wonder, the first 2D Mario in a while and the first new entry that had no affiliation with the New series, was very much an unexpected drop for this year. My god. They made a whole **** meal. 
This game is the epitome of 2D Game Design. It follows the golden rule of game design perfectly. And it did it SEVERAL DOZEN TIMES. THAT ISN'T EASY TO DO IN GENERAL (looking at the Mario Maker community) AND IT ISN'T EASY TO DO MULTIPLE TIMES WITHOUT MESSING UP AT LEAST ONCE, AND THEY DIDN'T MESS UP. Needless to say, this game is so well designed that it should be studied. 
This is the freshest 2D Mario gameplay ever. It's so full of life and charm, even in the little things, like how the groundpound has a drumroll that plays when in the air and then a crash when you land. There's so much charm to this gameplay, which mind you, plays like World but better, that it is never boring.
The amount of content in this game is a lot. 6 main worlds full of levels, a center world with more levels, and the special world with the most challenging levels in the game, it comes out to a lot of levels and content. Thanks to them following the golden rule of 2D Game Design and the Wonder mechanic, each level is unique and fun, and not an ounce of boredom is present. I'm actually flabbergasted and how they did this so well with this scale of content. 
The multiplayer in this game is easily the best in the series. Players can't directly mess with one another via collision, so the levels can still be played like normal. But you can still throw shells and troll one another, so it still has that chaotic Wii violence. And the online play, oh MY GOD is it brilliant. You can see all bunch of players playing the same level as you in real time, say hi to each other, give each other powerups, and help each other with standees or revival. It's perfect, I love it.
The music is fire. I haven't listened through the whole OST, so I don't have too in-depth of an analysis on this, but from the musical levels to just the remixed tracks from even SUPER MARIO SUNSHINE, it's just fire.
I originally was upset with the lack of difficulty in the game, but the final final level in this game revealed itself, and it took me 34-ish lives to complete. This was one of the hardest levels in not just 2D Mario, but in all of Mario. While I still wish the difficulty was a bit more built up to that level, I'm okay with the closest thing we've gotten to an official Kaizo level.
Overall, this is the best 2D Mario game by a mile, and was my favorite one to 100%. 10/10 D-tier",10,10
metacritic,LeJeffBezos,super-mario-bros-wonder,"Super Mario Bros. Wonder is a WONDERFUL piece of gaming. Seriously this game is my favourite 2D Mario Game. Each Level is awesome and beautiful designed, there are several new types of enemys, the game feels more alive than ever thanks to the beautiful and elaborate animations, every Level is unique and wonderful flowers provide variety and ""WOW""-moments. The Badges provide for individuality, little Challenges provide for even more variety and the Overworld is better than ever. The marvelous soundtrack lets you immerse yourself in the game. But every game has some flaws. The two biggest flaws in the game are first the Bosses. The Bosses in Super Mario Bros. Wonder are terribly lame and repeat themself, because there is actually just one Boss: Bowser jr and sometimes worlds don`t even have a boss. The second, not so big, flaw is, that sometimes Wonder Effects repeat themself. This happens lucky just a few times but is still a problem. One small thing would be that the game is too easy, but that is rather irrelevant. Overall, Super Mario Bros. Wonder is a fantastic game for the Nintendo Switch and without any minor flaws I would probably rate the game a 9,9/10 to 9,95/10, but as the game looks now I would rate it a 9,7/10",9,10

There’s a great variety in difficulty, which keeps the gameplay challenging without ever feeling overwhelming.

You'll have to stop for a second, then perform the roll, then stop for a second again, and then you can do something else.

The incredible artwork and dedication the Developers have put in the game are deserving of recognition. The music is amazing well produced and made, motivating you to keep up with the fight and **** you into the mystery of the world. Definitely one of the best soundtracks for a game.
For collectors there are log books that contain lore of enemies. It is a joy to read the journal entries of enemies to expand upon the world building. The items you collects by completing challenges and playing through the game also have log entries that help to explain the lore of the world before the events of the game.

The rush and excitement of fighting through hordes of monsters and bosses to reach new stages keeps the pace up. The final boss is a fitting and fair end to the game. The challenge of the hard difficulty takes time to adjust to, but with practice the anger switches from anger to fun. The artifacts you collect can create new experiences that are worth experimenting with.

The variety of characters and items can fit any player, the game doesn't force you to play one way but instead encourages experimentation. All characters are well balanced and unique.

metacritic,Vectis99,risk-of-rain,"Risk of Rain takes a gritty aesthetic and a distinctly creative approach to creating an action game. It was developed according to a cohesive design and balancing philosophy which, while difficult to figure out at first, leads to a very distinct and interesting experience. The way the game is paced is innovative, rewarding the player for increasing their speed, but at the same time this feels somewhat like a brute force solution to better, more fluent level and difficulty design. The game has a very steep learning curve and moderate skill cap which should be able to engage a wide audience of player skill levels and attention spans. It is worth noting that the game tries to extend its ""length"" far beyond reasonable by creating a long and convoluted unlockable tree which doesn't change or enhance the gameplay very much, mainly existing as a series of shiny virtual items to keep players repeating the mostly-identical levels over and over again.",6,10
metacritic,yankesik,risk-of-rain,"Great action platformer with roguelike elements. Atmospheric music and 8-bit graphics which complement each other perfectly. Each design-whether we are talking about enemies, levels, characters or items, is very interesting. Each enemy type, and every item have it's own lore, or backstory of sorts. The number of artifacts (unlockable game changing modifiers), enemy modifiers (like those of champion/boss versions of Diablo monsters), items and unlockable characters, each with four unique abilities, do wonders for the game's replayability.

The game is not without issues, however.
Characters aren't perfectly balanced, on the contrary. Some of them are a lot harder to play, and don't do too well in the late game (Sniper, Acrid, Bandit), while others are a much easier to use and powerful at the same time, especially the Engineer, A.K.A. The Vending Machine of Doom. If you know what you are doing, you can also easily snowball out of control using specific artifacts and items, and even the Monsoon difficulty level becomes a Breeze, at best.
Another problem of Risk of Rain is the game engine-it could be a little bit more stable. Also, while most players probably won't encounter this problem, when you get into sessions longer than 90, the number of enemies and projectiles on the screen is just to much for the poor engine-in game timer slows down, the game plays as in slow motion, and some effects disappear. The game remains playable, though. Last but not least, the multiplayer is unfriendly, and quite unstable.
Still, I heartily recommend it, especially if collecting items while fighting off hordes of unrelenting enemies on a very alien planet sounds appealing to you.",9,10

It's hard, and punish your mistakes, but not to the point where you can call it bad game design. After some time, even the lore got me hooked up.

metacritic,the_Slugman,risk-of-rain,"Bravo, dudes.

Risk of Rain is a game that will bring you a different experience each time you open it up. in terms of random drops/pickups, few games pull this off as successfully as RoR (BoI does well at this, but RoR is the true champion). The characters are diverse and feature difficulties and advantages unique to their skillsets. The sheer volume of unlockables in this game will keep you starting up another run to unlock the next character or weapon. Some of these items and characters are earned by killing certain monsters in a certain way, finding secret areas on the randomly generated maps, defeating secret bosses, collecting mysterious relics, or activating and figuring out hidden puzzles. Risk of Rain is a retro experience with a new-age twist and a belly full of secrets characters and weapons.

The controls are tight, though to the uninitiated they may seem clunky at first. This is all part of the journey that is Risk of Rain – once you've unlocked things like double jump (Hoopoo Feather), Rusty Jetpacks, Photon Jetpacks, and Goat Hoofs you'll be telling a different story. The world you are dropped in is convincing, deadly, and awe-inspiring – once you grasp the enormity of this world and its inhabitants you'll begin to realize your smallness on screen is no accident.

I absolutely love the aesthetic of this game for the most part, and I can't recommend it enough to someone looking for a game with infinite replay value and a great multiplayer mode. Just don't play on the same computer (the sprites are too tiny for this), so make sure your buddy has a gamepad and $15 bucks to drop if you want to play with a friend. Minor bugs and poor menus are annoying, but they won't prevent you enjoying the game overall (with 60 hours on record, I've seen my fair share of game ruining freezes and yet still find myself booting right back up).",9,10

Its Easy to play, but very hard to master, this 'quote' can be applied to this game. Every playable character has its own unique play-style, which is very cool.

It's fun solo and a blast on multiplayer, but it absolutely fails on its difficulty curve. Any game that calls itself a ""rogue-like"" should reward two things: smart choices, and random luck. I have played this game enough times to experience both, and yet, I consistently am unable to pass the third or fourth level.
Most of the time, it doesn't come down to skill; it comes down to what items randomly spawn and whether or not enemies spawn directly on top of you. I don't mind randomness in games, but when randomness trumps skill, the game may as well just be a dice-rolling simulator.
My verdict? Stay far away from this game. There are much worthier platform/shooter/roguelikes that deserve your attention.",3,10

metacritic,karmasleeper,risk-of-rain,"Risk of Rain is a game that is fun on your own and even more addictive with friends.  Unfortunately, I fear most people are going to be discouraged by the old style direct connect multiplayer method.  I found multiplayer through Hamachi worked well after an initial set up and removed some of the hassle.

The game is difficult and is designed to require many many playthroughs before seeing every level and unlocking each class.  As you move through the levels and kill monsters you earn gold that you can use to buy power ups.  Some of these have neat descriptions but others are very vague and require you to experiment with them to figure out how they work.  After a while, you start to learn which power ups work well with which character class.  Unfortunately, things aren't as easy as selecting which power ups you want like a class load out.  No, you have to find them in the game world in chests or buy them from dispensers.  It's random chance if you'll find something useful or get your money's worth.  This might be frustrating for some players as your success in any given game will largely depend on the luck of the draw.  For others this will enhance the skill based aspect of the game, and the game does require a degree of skill.  Each class has four abilities.  Learning how and when to use them is essential to survival.  Some abilities combo well with others and some even complement the power ups.  The game is more intricate than it first appears and with each game you peel back another layer.  My only major criticism is the game's visual appearance.  It's a nice pixel art style, which looks charming, but with so many things on screen in the latter levels from ability effects to explosions to experience and coin pickups to burning terrain, things get messy and indistinguishable fast.  While it does add a certain layer of tension it is also frustrating.  In short, great game with great value for the price.

Enemies are randomly spawned, so it's ever so slightly different every time you play. Should you want an excuse to extend your visit to the dullard nebula, that's the best I could think of.

All this for $9.99. Atrocious.",0,10

It can be difficult, but with the available classes, all with unique, fun abilities, the game-altering artifacts, and the randomization that exists in the game is excellent, especially considering it was created by two students.

Good, cheap fun. 10/10",10,10
metacritic,Claytality,risk-of-rain,"Great combat, great variety of classes, and very nice choice of items that help you upgrade your character during your play through.

It is so much fun to watch your character go from wimpy no items to 20 items and pwning everything in sight.  Most games single player take about 20-60 minutes but they are very fun.  The artifacts also add some extra fun in letting you customize your game settings to a certain extent.

It is a difficult game but it has easy, normal, and hard difficulty settings so even noobs can do well.  Dying almost always seems fair and not at all frustrating, which is key in a rogue-like game.

Probably not worth $10, maybe wait for sale.  I got 20 hours out of this gem.",8,10

metacritic,Oratio,risk-of-rain,"This game is truly amazing. The game itself gives many opportunities to use many different powerups and characters and there are many worlds and bosses. It may be hard to finish the boss and the enemy at each level but  the effort will truly pay off. You will be rewarded with a new level with new monsters and elemental types. The powerup collecting is always fun in this game and you will need it to conquer all the bosses and hardcore enemies. And you will have to do it quickly because the more time it will take for you to kill them the harder the enemies will be.

Xbox Control support.
Very smooth controls for both keyboard and Xbox controller.
Lots of unlocks to keep you interested.
Great multiplayer and very fun with friends

Cons:
Some classes and items are very hard to unlock even for veteran players.
Multiplayer items can be hard to work out on who gets what .(this is easy to get around if your playing with friends)
Can get very laggy in later levels due to to many enemies making the frames suffer even for good computers.",9,10
metacritic,Prellwurst,risk-of-rain,"One of the best rogue likes I enjoyed! I absolutely recommend that game for everyone that is not offended by retro style graphics.

Risk of rain has that very appealing minimalistic pixel graphic style that is utilized here to build wonderful levels and great looking monsters. The soundtrack **** my in and matched the atmosphere of the world quite well.
The combat is fluid with all the charactes i have played so far (6 in number) and they have their own very unique style in matters style and tactics.
The huge amount of unlockables and achievements contribute to the big replay value.

A small downturn is that I have the feeling that until now only the starting character 'commando' is able to perform well with an arbitrary set of items. Rest of the chars seem to need very specialized gear or just lack mobility to get past some monster types.
But thats just one flaw and maybe a very subjective one.",9,10
metacritic,LordOfCthulu,risk-of-rain,"This game is amazing.  I have only had it for just over two days and have already devoted 23 hours to is and have unlocked 4 of the playable characters.  No, I am not a developer as some other reviewers have suggested and am in no way associated to this game aside from the fact that I play it.  Yes, at first I did think that the controls were rather frustrating but all you have to do is go to the controls configuration and change the jump key to up so that it shares a key with the climb function (trust me, this works really well).  In contrast to what others have said, climbing ropes and ladders in this game works just fine and in no way involved jumping, you just hold the up key.  This game is quite challenging if you play it for about 10 minutes or maybe even less depending on starting difficulty as time played=difficulty, meaning it continually gets much much harder.  Also, abilities such as protect and serve (aka enforcer's shield) are in no way OP, as it only protects you from the front and greatly limits your mobility.  Plus, later in the game, this doesn't even matter because many enemies have powerful projectiles that target you from behind and therefore get around the shield and there are also many enemies that deal splash damage, getting around your shield.  The other ability that was suggested to be OP is the commando's dive roll which only makes you invincible for about half a second and has a cool-down  of about 4 second.  Overall, this game is great and ignore the negative reviews because they obviously have not devoted any time or effort to the game.",10,10
metacritic,fireb4llz,risk-of-rain,"This game is vastly underrated it baffles me how this game didn't even reach a metascore of 80. Even COD: Ghosts on PS4 got a higher critic score.... Whats even better is that most of the reviews say almost nothing bad about the game and give it such positive feedback, yet end it with a 7-8/10... This makes no sense to me at all. I can easily consider this one of the best indies I've ever played and easily one of the very best games of 2013. 77 on matecritic is just bs... It deserves at least an 88-90.",10,10

metacritic,Kluge,risk-of-rain,"Excellent roguelike, but maybe the devs should have been a bit more conscious of how similar the game is to Binding of Isaac. It lacked the quirky fun I expect in current-gen roguelikes, I had trouble figuring out what many items were supposed to look like (""here's a light tan blob that looks like a cookie mostly consumed by ants -- it's some monster tooth which increases your attack power,"" ""ummm... okay""), and the items didn't have the flair I was expecting, instead largely just changing numbers around a bit instead of necessitating a shift in playing style like Binding of Isaac items could. I initially ignored the game just by its name -- I thought it was some phone game port. It came across with the attitude of a more straight-forward arcade game out of the nineties, though gameplay is very fun for all the same reasons Binding of Isaac is. I very much appreciate the bite-size chunks you get from gameplay (where a round could last between 5 minutes and 30+ minutes) which lets me play as long as I want without worrying I'll have to continually interrupt gameplay to take care of other things. It's a very well-executed combination of twitch, luck, and skill which feels satisfying whether you reach the end on a play-through or not. Definitely recommend if you're new to the genre or have enjoyed similar titles.",8,10

metacritic,Dusty_Hayes,risk-of-rain,"Rain of Rain has its own unique graphical charm (if a little unpolished) coupled with an awesome soundtrack and tough, fun, addictive indie roguelike gameplay Rain of Rain keeps you begging for more while rewarding your hard work gamers which are not familar with roguelikes maybe be a little intimidated with its tough unforgiving oldskool nature.",8,10
metacritic,muhku,risk-of-rain,"This game throws you into a interesting, bizarre and very hostile world without much advice on what to do or how to survive. One thing: get going or get killed. It took me a while to realize that unlike most games it's often not worth it to search the whole level for loot and stuff, because the game gets incrementally harder as time passes.

You need to find good equipment, and fast, or you will not survive very long. There are, however, many ways and strategies to approach the game, depending on what items the Random Number Generator gives you. One thing that bugs me is that in order to get a good quick start in the first level, you need gold. In order to get gold, you need enemies to kill. Usually it works out, but on some playthroughs it takes a good 2 minutes before anything starts spawning on the first level... Sometimes it seems that more enemies spawn once you kill the first ones, but this is not always the case. I don't know if this is a bug.

Playing this game you will die. But it doesn't matter, because the replay value seems to be quite good. This is the first game in a long while where I did not feel the need to adjust difficulty to ""insane"" or whatever. You constantly unlock more things to find while playing. There is some contradiction in this: you unlock better items when you get further in the game, which in a way actually makes the game a bit easier the more you play it. A slight learning curve exists, but it doesn't matter because it's all action. Anyway, once you learn the right strategies for getting good stuff and fighting various enemies with different classes, utilizing your items etc. the game becomes quite fun.

All that said, the game is both challenging and rewarding, and having played for a couple of days I can say that I'm totally hooked. 9/10",9,10

metacritic,Hallz,risk-of-rain,A great rogue-lite! I don't usually like games that are timed (difficulty grows as time passes) but it works very well  preventing you from farming. Quick paced action with many collectible items to keep the game from growing stale. I highly suggest this title!,9,10
metacritic,Rogyapa,risk-of-rain,"A fun game for fans of rogue-likes. The overall concept of the game is quite simple, kill enemies, get to the teleporter on each level, and do it as quickly as possible. The game gets harder over time  with a visual indicator showing a bar that  fills up) so you better book it to the teleporter. The controls are tight and the sound design is quite good. The art style is charming in a retro-esque way.
There is a bit of a metagame in that if you rush to the teleporter too early you won't have enough items (or good enough ones) to survive the next level. I do like how the items stack allowing you to get better bonuses.
There's no point to hoarding gold in the game as your leftover gold gets turned into experience when you use the teleporter.
I've only played the first 2 characters but the commando is extremely fun to play because of his agility and long range capabilities. I can't say whether all the other characters are equally as fun since I only have the enforcer unlocked (besides the commando).
There's not much for story except for little blips from the codex or item descriptions but honestly, if you're playing this for a story you've come to the wrong game.

My biggest complaints are that certain levels become very platforming-heavy  (which can be quite difficult when under attack) and that the difficulty can spike if you don't have decent items.",8,10

metacritic,artanis,risk-of-rain,"Difficult game, but once you master the controls it's a heck of a lot of fun.  The low scores are people that likely didn't give it enough time, or are bad at games that require precise, quick control.",10,10
metacritic,fodschwazzle,risk-of-rain,"Taking serious notes from ""The Binding of Isaac,"" this game kills the player unless the player can acquire a good set of equipment to prevent that from happening. The game will attempt to guile you into thinking that level ups are important- but the balance is, while you're still weak, to try and find the best supplies in the shortest amount of time.

Because within 15 minutes, bosses start spawning. The enemies uniformly become stronger. Your best weapons are merely **** in the tough skins of the monsters that follow from there. All this awareness of the impending end is buffeted by the shinyness of opening a box, or killing a boss monster. or stacking an item that you've already got one of and already love the effect. And then... like ashes in your mouth, your character is killed by an unusually hard mob.

There are more characters to unlock. They ALL have benefits. Everyone will have their own favorite character- right now mine is the huntress for her ability to run and shoot. They unlock slowly enough that you'll be ready for a change. It will be a big change.

The randomization of loot is not the downside, but the draw here. And after you visit later levels you can return and replay the set if you wish, before facing the final boss. It's this kind of New Game+ that warms the  of my heart. By the time you reach the highest difficulty (factored by time) you will be facing large numbers of bosses simultaneously. And if you're careful, they'll simply be food for the war machine as you continue to acquire items.

It is a lovely game. Every aspect pushes the fact that a two man team created this to the limit of achievement. Even the music has a polish not often heard in indie games (hated Spelunky's music).

The low reviews have been created by 1 of 3 kinds of people.
A.) Don't favor roguelikes.
B.) Don't favor serious challenge in a game.
C.) Expect massive studio polishing even when playing an indie game.

Risk of Rain is a difficult game that slowly rewards your efforts. The payoff is sweet. And if the titanic pile of loot I gathered at the end of my last play session that allowed me to curbstomp anything and everything in my path is a kind of payoff from these two people who made this game, they are firmly entitled to my favorable review.",10,10

metacritic,CC11,risk-of-rain,"The only bad reviews i see for this are nitpicking. This game is fantastic for its price and for the fact that only 2 people made it. great soundtrack, fun combat and alot more fun in multiplayer when multiple classes are at use on one run. There is no such thing as a ""bad"" item, like in Binding of Isaac, and all of the items abilities are described on pickup so you know what you have. Sure, there is a luck based element on what items you get on a run, but the luck isn't nearly as impactful as games like Rogue Legacy and Isaac, you can still beat the game if you know how to properly use whichever character you're using. The game may seem dull at first, because you only have one class, but as you unlock the other 9 classes the replayability becomes more and more evident. For its price, it is a must buy in my opinion.",10,10

Graphics 2/2: No complaints, beautiful art, in my opinion. It may not be to the liking of others, but do you honestly expect, or want AAA graphics from 2 students, who, in my opinion, di an amazing job.
Gameplay: 2/2: It's simple, and not as fiddly as I first thought, it may just take some getting used to.

People are saying how fun and addictive this game is but for whatever reason I cannot relate to that. I find the controls annoying and on multiple occasions have found myself pressing the wrong button thus activating the wrong ability. With the default PC controls, it is incredibly difficult to climb ropes/ladders/whatever-they-are, because you cannot jump diagonally.

I can play Age of Empires 2 HD without worrying about port forwarding and it's from the 90s!",0,10
metacritic,MikeZillaGames,risk-of-rain,"I don't really understand the hype around this title. Yes, it's a rogue like with some solid, even compelling mechanics, but the more you play it, the more flawed it feels. An unfair element of luck(even for a rogue-like), poor class balance, monotonous level design, and several outstanding technical issues stop RoR from reaching greatness on both single player and multiplayer.

I prefer the gamepad over the keyboard controls. RoR's combat is frantic and fun, with each character class having several unique attacks. All the crazy items you collect stack up on effectiveness and they are really what is making you stronger. With the right classes and a lot of luck, multiplayer in RoR is frantic and fun.

...but as a single player game? This game falls flat on it's face. For one major issue, not all the classes are balanced that well. The starting class, the commando, has an indispensable dodge maneuver and a long attack **** some classes have neither of these, making it impossible to even outrun the monsters on screen which will surely annihilate you very quickly.

It's obvious that these classes were all designed with multiplayer in mind. Nevertheless, it doesn't play well alone. Even the rogue like elements feel kinda uninteresting. Randomized loot works a lot like how loot worked in The Binding of **** theres no reason NOT to collect everything you find. But because of the element of luck, you'll have good runs and bad based entirely on where stuff is. You'll sometimes find yourself going around in circles, frustrated as more and more stronger enemies spawn right on top of you while you can't find the level exit.

Beyond that, there are technical problems too. While the sound track is great, I couldn't help but notice that NO MUSIC plays in about half these levels after the first one. And sometimes, for some reason, the music just doesn't play at all unless you restart from the menu. Gamepad integration is horrible, too. Certain menus only work if you use the mouse...whereas others can be navigated with the game pad. It's a nitpick, but it's still incredibly annoying.",6,10
metacritic,thesambassador,risk-of-rain,"This is a decent game and the combat is a lot of fun.  However, the platforming is extremely dull and most of the game is spend unloading hundreds of rounds into enemies with way too much health.  It's not that it's hard, it's just dull.  Killing some ""normal"" enemies can take over 30 seconds, and a lot of the time that's when you're on a ledge they can't get to, spamming your abilities until they die.  This is fine for the bosses, but fighting pretty much every enemy involves the exact same steps.

The game seems to assume that more health  more damage  harder enemies, which, while true, is a really boring way to increase difficulty.

There aren't any clear ways to unlock anything.  The game doesn't explain what you should be doing to unlock things.  Getting far (to say level 4 or 5) doesn't get you any progress towards unlocking things, you have to complete ""achievements"" which are random things like ""Fail a shrine 3 times in a row"" or ""get to 500 health"".

The levels are actually designed, and there are only 2 variations per ""zone"".  however, the placement of enemies/powerups/end of level are randomized.  This seems good, but the levels are extremely boring to walk though, and coupled with the really boring platforming mechanics, it just ends up being pretty boring to go through.

Overall, it's a decent game to spend a few hours on, but it doesn't even get close to games like Spelunky and Binding of Issac.  Towerclimb is a much better Rogelike platformer.",6,10

I'd recommend this game to anyone who likes Spelunky and Binding of Isaac.  Their is just enough random to make every run different while not overdoing it and making it feel impossible.  One thing I love about this game that is hard to say about a lot of roguelikes is that when I die, its my fault.  I messed up somewhere and that is powerful, that puts the hook in you baiting you telling you to do better.  Visuals are what they are, if you see screenshots you get what you see I personally think they could be a little sharper but they don't detract from the game and more importantly they NEVER overcomplicate things which can be a problem in other games.  The sound, oh god the sound just listen to the soundtrack and tell me you dont want to be blastin baddies on an alien homeworld.  The gameplay, well its hard to describe.  Its a lot of Dip Duck DOdge dive duck whatever else their is and a lot of strategic use of cooldowns.  Its really well done and I only have 2 characters (Both of which feel very different.)

metacritic,Sepherim,risk-of-rain-2,"Inicialmente, Risk of Rain 2 me gustó mucho, pero a medida que fueron pasando las horas rápidamente se fue transformando cada vez más en aburrimiento. Las razones hablaré de ellas ahora, pero quiero que quede claro que lo jugué en solitario, con lo que probablemente las sensaciones y eso para quienes lo jueguen en multiplayer con amigos (como está diseñado) sean mejores. Si resumimos mucho, el juego es un shooter rogue-like, con mogollón de enemigos, cada vez más y más duros, en lo que explorar zonas para conseguir mejoras aleatorias y desbloquear el teleportador previa batalla contra el boss. El problema es que se hace muy repetitivo porque le faltan cosas típicas de los roguelike. Una de esas cosas es que los mapas aquí son fijos (con variaciones menores como zonas pequeñas que pueden estar accesibles o no), con lo cual se acaba conociendo los mismos demasiado, si además tenemos en cuenta que los primeros los ves todo el rato, se acaba haciendo muy repetitivo. Luego le falta una historia así como un sistema de progresión de cualquier clase que otorgue objetivos o razones para jugar, pero en este caso cada intento es completamente independiente. El único cambio que queda de una partida a otra es lo que vas desbloqueando, que se hace en base a conseguir logros, algunos de los cuales ocurrirán simplemente por ir jugando, pero la mayoría acaban dependiendo del azar de que te caigan los bonos adecuados, de que una habilidad ocurra de cierto modo, etc. lo cual acaba siendo muy frustrante. Igual que lo es el hecho de que, llegado cierto punto y con una build decente, al final el juego se resume en ""te vas cargando todo sin que te hagan nada hasta que llegas al lugar equivocado y sin que puedas evitarlo, de una hostia te bajan entero"". Gráficamente el juego tiene una estética muy suya pero personalmente no me ha gustado nada,  y tiene además ciertos problemas de legibilidad en la distancia (como que los cadáveres de ciertos enemigos parecen cofres). La música ahí ya es cosa de gustos, para mi es demasiado electrónica noventera, que es un género que no me convence, pero ahí habrá a quien si le parezca perfecta y sin duda, no puedo decir que sea mala pese a que no encaje en mis gustos. No hay voces como tales, los efectos de sonido son muy básicos. Y el juego tiene ciertos bugs ocasionales como cosas que spawnean dentro de paredes, una baja IA de enemigos y aliados, **** todo ello, Risk of Rain no me parece un juego terrible, pero tampoco gran cosa. Y acaba repitiéndose como una cena que te sienta pesada. Un 4.",4,10

metacritic,ToasterOven01,risk-of-rain-2,"HOLY CRAP THIS GAME IS GOOD. Every stage, every item, every character ( except rex ) is AMAZING and there are almost no limits to what you can do with your character. If you are thinking of playing this for a fun experience then you are in for a treat because this game lets you unlock stuff really easily and start making crazy builds right off the bat. There's even multiplayer which makes this experience even crazy. One last thing is the DLC and the extra stuff in the game, I don't remember what they're called but there a modifiers that either make the game really hard, or make you a god, like the command modifier which lets you... command what you get from loot boxes. The DLC is an amazing addition to the game, but the game feels very empty and incomplete AT TIMES if you don't have it making it mandatory to get it, but its like, 15$ so unless you're broke as hell, just get the DLC and move on. Anyway 10/10 play it NOW....................................................",10,10

metacritic,MonkeyTownUSA,risk-of-rain-2,"I was skeptical at first when my friend told me to buy this but I eventually caved in. I now have over 250 hours and I am enjoying the game now more than ever. The graphics look good but also don't require a super good PC. The enemies are fun (except blind pests. **** blind pests). and dont even get me started on the music. Chris Christodoulou is an absolute chad. But what really makes this game so fun and what keeps me coming back is the variety. There are around 150 items and 40 equipment, each one doing something different. Pair this with the 13 (not including heretic) survivors and you have infinite possibilities. The best part about items is that you can stack them  infinitely. Artifacts and the eclipse mode offer new challenges and ways to play the game. But again, the items are what make this game so fun. every item, no matter how useless it may seem, has some sort of synergy or use in at least one item build. I may be failing calculus but at least i know the statistics of every item in this game
Overall, anyone who may be skeptical like I was, this game is 100% worth it. The base game is not too expensive and there is already 1 DLC, with another on the way.",10,10

The concept of the game is relatively simple, however there is a wonderful recipe that Hopoo baked that makes this game so fun. Creative, distinct, awesome soundtrack, and some really entertaining survivors to play as.

metacritic,Skytchup,risk-of-rain-2,"Risk of Rain 2 is even better than the first opus. 
At first I was afraid it might not be suited for a 3D game but then I was petrified when I saw how much it seduced me. The gameplay is really well done and each character is very unique.
You can select the difficulty, the rules, the speed of your runs and therefore there is a lot of freedom that makes it both a great game for try harders but also casual players.
Because the quality of the gameplay is so high, I would have maybe expected a slightly more ""accurate"" environment. Let me explain: when you start playing, the first levels feels too big as your character is slow and you have only a small jump and a travel ability with cooldown for most heroes. Later, after getting items, you can travel the entire map within few seconds and it feels like the levels are now too small.
That being said, it's very difficult to continue playing after playing a long run, as the character is a lot slower. I think this frustrating feeling could be removed by sizing the levels based on the time/items.",8,10

I do wish it had auto sprint, though.",8,10
metacritic,yuki__,risk-of-rain-2,played.,5,10
metacritic,Saume,risk-of-rain-2,"It's a great roguelike shooter.

The characters all feel significantly different, but my main problem is that they almost all want to build the same items anyway. It's still a fun game, and there are some cool modifiers to try, like the one that lets you choose your items, or the one that makes items drop from enemies instead of having X chests per level.

Choosing your items is a little too powerful though, as you can just make the perfect build every time. This game really shines in multi-player with random item drops, as you can decide to leave certain items to certain people and assign your loot in a way you feel is optimal. The main problem in multiplayer is that if you die, you're just watching until next level. If you're player with someone much worse or much better than the rest of the group, it could be annoying for those that spend a lot of time dead. They also fall behind because they get no items while the person who's already stronger and managing to stay alive gets stronger by hoarding all items.

Runs can last between 30 to 60 minutes, but you have the ability to loop infinitely, though at some point stuff will start to one-shot you.

Overall, it's a fun game, and definitely not bad, but I find myself preferring Gunfire Reborn over this basically every time.",8,10

Hoopoo Games is a relatively small team of incredibly talented people who really cared about and loved this project enough to help it grow into the indie dynamo that it is.

The beauty of RoR2 and why its so addicting is that the only limiting factor in this game is time. The longer you spend playing each level the more the difficulty rises creating this growing tension which never seems to stop. Will you go that legendary item even if it take you and extra 5 mins to get it? The choice is yours, but is it worth it? That's what draws you in and urges you to keep playing.

There are also many secrets (including hidden locations) in the game, which are quite a challenge to find. The title is definitely worth recommending, especially after the release of version 1.0, where we already have the final boss added.

metacritic,OminousToaster,risk-of-rain-2,"Worth every cent. Shows that you don't need a big studio and 7 years to make a good game. Hopoo's dedication to making fun their first priority really shows in every part of the game. Some people complain that the stages aren't randomized, but this would be nearly impossible to do in 3D and this is made up for in the massive pool of items along with the unique characters that change the entire playstyle. The scaling difficulty mechanic was a stroke of genius from the devs and makes the game easy to get into unlike many other games in the same genre. Many people complain about the difficulty and repetitiveness but they just haven't given it a chance and actually tried to see what the game has to offer. The characters are all unique and provide an entirely different playstyle and you can get a god run with any of them. I'm shocked to see how balanced these characters are in a game all about becoming overpowered. The items aren't just simple stat boosts, but all have their entirely unique properties. All the complaints about graphics are unwarranted; I personally love the artstyle of this game, and would recommend it to ANYONE looking for a new game to sink hundreds of hours into. I am super excited for the next content update, and for anyone worried about the game dying after it stops development, it has an active modding scene that will keep the game alive for years. Hopoo deserved every word of praise they get, so please, buy the game. It's only 25 dollars and is more fun than most 60 dollar games.

metacritic,CompleteIdiot,risk-of-rain-2,"Interesting roguelike concept, where you can prioritize either getting stronger while making enemies stronger as well, or trying to beat it as fast as possible before the time pumps up the difficulty. Unfortunately getting new heroes is a massive grind, and the core gameplay loop becomes extremely shallow and doesn't justify the time it takes to get alternatives to your starting hero. I got 4 unlocked and got bored of the grind it takes to get the rest of them. I think the series has a great potential, but the reward factor needs to be optimized to the time invested.",6,10
metacritic,wilderplain,risk-of-rain-2,"I find it hard to understand the 'Overwhelmingly Positive' review score on Steam. There are so many issues with this game.

This is a roguelike with poor balance and terrible RNG systems, which means that every so often you have a fun run and the rest of the time its a total drag to play. There's only a few levels and they get samey really fast. There's only a few bosses and they get samey really fast. Movement always starts off super slow and clunky, and this only changes if the RNG allows it to.

There are many things that could have been done to improve the experience, but the main one for me is that the game should give the player more agency over their build. The way things stand, the player is a slave to layer upon layer of RNG. There is RNG as to how many loot item boxes spawn in a level, where they are, what type they are, and of course what's inside them. There is one loot box that is a choice of three, but often one or two of the three is a question mark, aka, a random item! (why???)

Roguelikes work best in these ways: either let the player choose between two or three pickups most of the time so that they can consciously move toward a build (like Slay the Spire or Hades), and/or make sure there are enough pickups that the player can figure it out on the way (like Dead Cells, Binding of Isaac). ROR2 does neither. And on top of that, it slaps you with a countdown, making the levels harder if you take time to look for more loot.

I can only assume the people rating this highly are rating it off of their rarer god-like runs and are forgetting about the drudgery runs. A good game should be FUN first and foremost, from the get-go, not promising potential fun somewhere down the line, and only if you're lucky enough to snag it.",4,10
metacritic,adeza,fez,"It's a very creative and unique puzzle game. I really liked solving the puzzles. 
The graphics are very cute.
I had a problem with the map. I constantly got lost and it was tiring having to go back and forth all the time during the game. I think it would be better if I could  focus more on the puzzles and less at remembering where I went.",9,10
metacritic,BeardedBambi,fez,"Genuinely one of the most genius games I’ve ever played. The only issue I have with it is how someone is supposed to do some of the puzzles and decipher the language without a guide. But other than that, really one of the best games I’ve ever played.",9,10
metacritic,reeseriley1776,fez,"I enjoy Fez for it's beautiful art style and unique gameplay. However there is way too much back tracking and that is something that I hate in videogames. Seeing something in the beginning **** but not being able to do anything until you come back towards the very end is such an annoying thing that developers need to stop doing. It's such a tease when you are shown something new that you cannot access and it distracts you from what you are already supposed to be enjoying. Many secrets and new areas are kept from you, requiring you to go back to the same areas long after you are finished with them. This game is nonstop when it comes to this issue and I really can't stand it. It isn't rewarding and it can be confusing when trying to make progress. Missing something requires you to back track through multiple doors, warp gates and repeated puzzle platforms. I found myself feeling less rewarded halfway through the game and more like wanted to just be done with it. I do not want to finish the game because I don't think it will make me feel like I accomplished something or had fun, which is how I hoped I would feel when I first started playing the game. Overall the art is very pleasing to me and the music is nicely done. There seemed to be some pretty interesting lore behind the world and its characters but I didn't get far enough to tie it all together. I really liked the puzzles and never had any trouble solving them it's just the constant warping, jumping, climbing and trying to go back and forth that really makes this game hard to enjoy. I do not like being forced to traverse the same levels over and over to progress in a game but unfortunately that is mostly what this game is. I don't like the map of the world and I absolutely hate not being able to fully complete a level until I have completed several other levels. Game designers should not make a game where things can not be completed in order! It makes the player have to worry about remembering to come back to places they already fully explored which is BORING. The player wants new things and to progress in a straight forward process that doesn't make you constantly wonder if you missed something in a previous level! This is very unfortunate because of this one thing, Fez goes from a charming and care free puzzle platformer to an exhausting mess that is slow and mind numbing. I really hope someone reads this before buying this game because it seems like such a good time in the beginning and you slowly just don't want to keep going anymore.",4,10
metacritic,APolChrome,fez,"(Reseña sacada de mi cuenta de Steam: APolChrome) Fez me ha sorprendido (y mucho). Es un juego único que probablemente ha hecho historia en el medio por ser uno de los primeros juegos de la corriente ""indie"" que a día de hoy es tan popular. Fuera de su significado, Fez me ha gustado mucho, pero me ha parecido extraño a partes iguales. Tengo bastante que decir, así que empecemos.Jugablemente, es muy innovador. A simple vista, parece un plataformas 2D como cualquier otro, hasta que todo se va de madre y puedes girar el escenario. Todo Fez juega con la percepción de las plataformas y la perspectiva, haciendo puzzles muy originales con esto. El diseño de niveles me ha gustado bastante y sin ninguna duda han sabido exprimir esta mecánica que parece muy simple, pero es muy compleja de **** mapa en sí me ha gustado muchísimo. Me ha parecido sorprendentemente amplio, pero en ningún momento se hace pesado (probablemente porque hay atajos y portales que te llevan a sitios bien ubicados). Todas las zonas tienen algo que te va a servir. No hay nada de relleno ni que esté solo por estar. Todas las zonas tienen algo que te sirve para progresar. Además, tienen mecánicas que las hacen únicas y aunque no sean mecánicas que revolucionen el juego, sí que aprovechan la principal (el cambio de perspectiva).Audiovisualmente, me ha gustado mucho. El juego es muy bonito (y eso que al principio se me hacía un poco recargado) y tiene un diseño de entornos espectacular. De personajes está bien, pero todos siguen la misma estructura. Y la banda sonora me ha gustado bastante. Muchas veces digo que no está muy presente, pero aquí sí está presente y a veces tanto que puede ser molesta, pero son casos muy contados.Como la historia de este juego es muy rara y creo que necesitaría más tiempo de juego, termino la reseña diciendo que Fez me ha gustado muchísimo y que me parece una experiencia que todos deberíamos jugar alguna vez, por su misterio y por su jugabilidad. Recomendadísimo",9,10

Immersive and unusual, one of the most interesting games i ever played.",9,10
metacritic,VLG,fez,The last game me and my ex-gf played before we broke up. I will never look at this game without tears in my eyes.,10,10
metacritic,Xplocion,fez,"The good:
Great work from PixelArt. It is not necessary to have all the collectibles to finish the game the first time. If you want to see the true ending you must collect 32 normal cubes, 32 anti-cubes, four artifacts, some maps, and three pieces of heart (leaving all the rooms of the maps with a gold frame). If you want to have an intellectual challenge within the game (without guide) It involves learning their numbering system and writing system. It has New Game + to give a review of the rooms where there are hidden cubes using another perspective. Any of the three finals is terrific.

The bad:
once you've found the joke, the game ""gets easier to complete."" The gliched room can be a processing challenge for early Xbox 360 models (and more so if you're trying to see it first-person on New Game +). Not backward compatible with Xbox One / Series

What Meh:
Seriously, the little man is named Gomez. By following a guide, anyone with patience gets 100% out of it. It is recommended to play with a controller that correctly serves the vibration in both triggers since these are used for rooms with anti-cubes. There is an anti-cube number 33 but discovering it generates a glitch that blocks the collector achievements and ends the game with all the collectibles",9,10
metacritic,Phaldyn,fez,"Fun experience; compelling story; decent physics; good looking retro graphics; cool and unique interface.  The codes and stuff are rather brutal, but there's a lot of support online to mitigate the most enigmatic of them.  Some levels rather hard to suss out how to complete; also, the interconnections between levels get really hard to navigate as the game progresses.  In spite of these gripes, the overall quality of the finished product is amazing.  Really too bad there won't be a sequel.

Politically speaking, I recognize the desire to lavish negativity on Mr. Phil, but at this point he's long since been trolled out of the industry.  This review is for anyone considering whether to plop down the two or three dollars to pick up a copy: it's fun and cool, a huge and absorbing **** least it was for me.  The negative reviews here are largely attacks on the creator, and it's safe to trust the critic reviews if you're just wondering whether it's worth a go.  The game-play and overall feeling of the universe are very different from Paper Mario (oft cited by those wishing to downplay Fez's innovations).

Is Fish a bad guy?  I don't know.  He seems to have said quite a number of inane and hypocritical things.  Is Fez an awesome game?  Hell yes.  Does the former have bearing on the latter?  Not much.  It's like telling someone that Being and Time was not a monumental work because Heidegger was a member of the **** party.  Sartre never would have happened without Heidegger, nor Derrida.  Fez, a monument in the history of gaming?!  Sure, I'll tick that check box.",9,10

metacritic,Stevesitz,fez,"An amazing puzzle/platformer that has so much more to it than meets the eye!  Simple to grasp and dive into with game play and sound track that keeps you playing.  This is the kind of game that really is for about everyone; play through once and just solve the simple puzzles, or play again and actually dive into the language of the game and find yourself decoding hieroglyphics on the walls.  Fez is very satisfying and never gets the feeling of becoming old.  I was quite sad to figure out that this game would not be getting a sequel and that the creator ended up being a huge tool.  The only thing that got this game a below perfect rating is the fact that it doesn't offer any kind of co-op and the fact that developer Phil Fish insulted so many fans, and really all gamers, after it's release.",9,10
metacritic,Remiel_Pollard,fez,"If this game was made for the sake of 'artistic expression', then we already have that with good gameplay in EVE Online. Glad I didn't spend money on this crap. I only regret exposing my PC's internals to potential depression due to installing terribad software.",0,10
metacritic,PulsatingBrain,fez,"I got this game in a Humble Bundle and so came to it a fair bit later on than it's release. I'd read about it generally being a kind of nostalgic and finely crafted game. In response to this I would just say that I don't remember any classic platformers having zero consequence for failure, and the music sounds just like a random haze, totally unlike the finely crafted 16 and 32 bit stuff of 20 years ago.

I was pretty underwhelmed by Fez, but can't really be too sad, having just gotten it in a bundle.",4,10
metacritic,mnt9,fez,Great game but many of the puzzles are extremely cryptic and require many guides on the internet to figure out. Worth playing for the graphics/sound/level design.

metacritic,Plasmaneedle,fez,Fez is a breath of fresh air in this console generation. It's innovative game world is brilliant and fun to navigate.

metacritic,Suuuper_Bored,fez,"Ah yes, Fez the as seen in Indie Game: The Movie. It had lots of hype for a platformer, so you know it's not going to live up to it.

Anyway, Fez **** IMO.",1,10
metacritic,gameface,fez,"Put aside all the politics of Phil Fish and the arguing over save bugs, if you're coming to Fez fresh now you're in for a treat. This is a game of two halves, the first about exploring a bizarre and vibrant world where your focus is not on combat but finding your way through. Once you've finished the game once it really begins to shine. The second play-through is all about unravelling some amazing and devious puzzles that will constantly surprise you. Fez is not just puzzle platformer it's more like an intricate layered puzzle box that just goes deeper and deeper.",10,10
metacritic,Grenna,fez,[SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.],10,10
metacritic,jayakers,fez,"I thoroughly enjoy Fez. After the first 'introductory' period... navigating easier levels... seemingly the second half of the game's difficulty is significantly increased. The difficulty spike does feel somewhat harsh as there are puzzles that are a fair amount tougher to solve and perhaps may put some players off... so much that they don't care for completing the game.

The look, sound but overall ""feel"" (a subjective term, I know) of the game is one that I miss from most games today... in the world of shooters we video game players live in. Disasterpeace's soundtrack fits the game perfectly... accompanying the sense of exploration, confusion and adventure that a player feels, traveling through the world Polytron has created.

The 2D/3D shift mechanic is quite an accomplishment and actually quite lovely to figure out. An enormous game with plenty of time to enjoy it. (8.67/10  rounded up to 9)",9,10
metacritic,RocketChump,fez,"Fez is a perfect game. Underneath the layers of exploration and beautiful scenery is a story about growing up, about life, about adventure and about looking beyond our 2 dimensional lives at the bigger picture. While there is no permanent death in the game, you will be challenged in both reflex and wits. There is a reason this game took so long to come out, it wasn't released until it was perfect. Fez will make you laugh, it will make you smile, it may even make you cry, to me it was and always will be a perfect game. Thank you Polytron.",10,10
metacritic,explodr,fez,"Easily one of the best games I've played on the XBOX 360, let alone the Arcade. Fez is an intuitive puzzle platformer that challenges players to think, which is also why you'll see so many bad ratings for it. Because people that gave this game a bad review are stupid.",2,10
metacritic,SoniColinK,fez,"What makes FEZ so wonderful isn't just  the art style, the music, the cute Adipose-Like protagonist Gomez, or even the mind boggling perspective switching. FEZ succeeds so triumphantly because all of these aspects coalesce into game that is fun, inventive, and, probably most importantly, interesting. While arguments can be made as to its originality, even the borrowed aspects of the game, like the desirable and well executed faux-8-bit art style, all feed into the experience that makes the most of simplicity. I won't make promises that this game is truly revolutionary or that it will be the best game you've ever played, but I rate it a 10 because it does something that no game has done for me since my young childhood; it intrigued me. While I am usually dominated by an achievement hunting approach to games, I found myself going out of my way to solve puzzles that weren't pertinent to my present goals. I got off my couch and downloaded a QR scanner on my iPad to see what the game was hiding from me. And, every step of the way, I felt like I was learning the game. If you can think in three dimensions (and what modern gamer can't?) then learning to navigate this title doesn't take very long. However, you can still constantly be learning new tricks to move about more quickly, discover the treasure maps that will unlock secrets you may have been stuck on for hours, feel like a genius when you can finally read the Tetromino puzzles, or even how to use the daunting map system! There wasn't a moment of the game that I didn't feel like I was growing as a participant.

Another incredibly important and enjoyable aspect of FEZ is its respect for gaming. The game is full of nods, nostalgia and throwbacks that never dominate the game, but may just make you smile, even if it's as simple as your Dot companion saying, ""Hey, Listen!"" Similarly, though the platforming may look like any old Super Mario bros installment, it still feels like its own. I'm not claiming that FEZ has reinvented platform jumping, but it has certainly done well in making this game its own.

The aesthetic of the game is also very noteworthy.Unlike Sonic The Hedgehog 4, it doesn't take the glory days of side-scrolling and slap a 3D texture on it, nor does it try to be an 8-bit game with a limited color palette and weak animation. The art style screams ""retro"" in sight and sound, but it is so much more than that. The use of the 8-bit style not only increases the game's accessibility to newcomers and nay-sayers, but it also permits FEZ the freedom from the weighty expectations of a more graphically intense title. In doing so, it allows itself a more open and imaginative feel. The narrative never gets more complex than, ""Hey, this just happened. Go fix it."" And in a lot of ways, that's great. Your concern is the gameplay and having as much fun as you can learning the game. So, gathering a lot of cubes is silly. You're wearing a fez and playing MC Escher's wildest dreams, so who cares?

All in all, this game is fantastic. As an FPS player, I never thought a side scroller could invigorate me as much as FEZ has. Even after I spent $500 on Halo 4 and beat its campaign on solo Legendary, I was never as truly engages as I was hopping around the delightful squares and curious cliff sides as the ever so adorable Gomez. Don't load up the game thinking your world will change from a $10 indie title, because it won't! Like Portal and Braid before it, FEZ simply takes ideas you know, love, and have probably mastered, and turns it on its side with a single mechanic that really is a game changer in every sense of the phrase. Pairing that with a beautiful setting and a soulful construction, FEZ is not a game you should pass up.

This game feels right, it plays right, it looks right, and you can really tell that Polytron cares to make a great game; I can confidently say that they have. Pick up that controller, don that multi-dimensional headgear, and try not to smile. I dare you.",10,10
metacritic,KevowOfRice,fez,"Love the gameplay and features, the sounds and graphics make it look old school and reminds you of the good 'ole times. But the lack of co-op or multiplayer makes you feel lonely and the player feels slightly sluggish moving around, especially on vines.",7,10
metacritic,ManicHispanic,fez,"This is simply great!! The mood and atmosphere are tranquil and peaceful while the world is vividly colorful and beautiful.

It really puts a smile on my face when you flip perspectives and three ladders or platforms that are miles apart from one perspective perfectly lineup from another. Buy this game!!

metacritic,ActRaiser,fez,"It's a 2d platformer with a 3d twist, you rotate the level around which makes other areas reachable etc. I really cannot do it justice in words, all I can say is that it is beautiful and enchanting and needs to be played. The music and atmosphere is perfect and it really immerses you in it's cute pixelated world. It's a bit like Cave Story, only much better! It's the first game since my c64 days where I have had a pen and paper to hand to decipher in-game codes / languages etc. There is also a part where you scan a barcode using an iphone / android phone and it gives you a code, I wont say any more as I don't want to ruin any surprises but this game is the first game in years to make you feel fully immersed in it's world, so far so that you have pages of scrawls and puzzles to figure out on paper while playing. You are never sure what will be coming next and feels like a step up from standard video games where you repeat the same thing over and over.

This is the best game I've played so far this year, just fun, innovative and back to it's retro roots. If you don't like this game you have no soul.",10,10
metacritic,ArMoRofGOD,fez,"I haven't got to the end yet but have been to most of the ""worlds"" and here's my interpretation this far.  The worlds are all amazing looking.  Phil Fish is a very talented artist and his work on Fez is perfectly suited.  Id give the art a 9/10 since there is some repetitiveness and a lack of variety in color.  The gameplay is fun but it too gets repetitive.  I find myself unable to play the game for long sessions as it gets boring after an hour or so and I need to put it down due to the repetition.  However, the polish of the gameplay is evident as the puzzles work just as expected and what must have been a very hard challenge to code was done very well, it is fluid and error free.  The navigation of the game is probably my biggest problem with it.  You will feel lost at times, and the worst part is, you will end up going through the same place more than a few times trying to figure out where to go next, and the map is of very little help (its too simple to help).  Overall its nothing revolutionary but I think the creator got what he expected from the game, a peaceful adventure for players to relax, enjoy the scenery and do some fun puzzles.  But since the gameplay is lacking and the repetitiveness is evident I would not feel right giving it an 8 where so many other indie games deserve that score or higher so 7 it is, not a bad score and I would say its worth playing but I'm not sure if Id buy it again.",6,10
metacritic,CabeysOdyssey,fez,Simply put:   Fez is my vote for game of the year.  You need to play this game to understand the depth and genius of the design.  Its games like this that revive my faith in the industry and comes as a welcome change.,10,10
metacritic,StevenP,fez,"For anybody out there that actually believes Fez is just an indie platformer with a gimmick, a cool soundtrack, and retro graphics couldn't be more wrong.

Fez is crazy. Phil Fish is crazy. Video games are awesome.",10,10

metacritic,ERR0RMACR0,fez,"All of the mid to low user reviews are by people who obviously did not 'get' this game at all.  I mean wow, I'm shocked by what they are saying:  ""plainly in sight block collecting""?  This game is deep beyond belief, but it's obvious that most people just never figured anything out.  Discovering the secrets in this game and just the overall feel of the game puts it in my top 5 favorite games of all time.  No hand holding, truly difficult puzzle solving, this is a classic even if the COD generation doesn't understand.  What a shame that there are actually people who played this game and thought that there was only little blocks to collect and jumping from platform to platform.

Do yourself a favor and do not look at online guides to spoil the secrets--when you finally crack them it will be much more rewarding than just reading how things work and doing it.",10,10

metacritic,Hyperthx,fez,"Absolutely beautiful 2D platformer with a modern twist.  Pure ambience and abstraction melded into an dreamy, self contained world that seems to go on forever.

metacritic,TheAwesomer,fez,"Fez is one of the most breathtaking games I have played in a long time, the colours are amazing, the music breathtaking, and gameplay is great although the 3d turning has been done before, Fez does a great job with the mechanic. This game is a must buy.",10,10
metacritic,xx8bitgeekxx,fez,"As an indie dev myself along with full time QA Tester, this game is fantastic!!! There are many complaints about the game being too easy and dying has no punishment. I think this was a good call in that the world of FEZ was definitely set up to pull you into it. Simply reseting the character makes you at times have to restart areas over, but prevents from really taking you out of the game. Honestly, what difference would a punishment make other than more screens to go through?
The game did take 5 years to develop and does have issues with crashing, which at times can be annoying. Here's the thing guys, those doing the cert for xbox live only have a limited time with it. They're not going to find these in that time. Also,this game was also only made by ONE guy!
Overall I greatly enjoyed the world of Fez and my journey through it. It was a nice game after a long day to play through, with lots and lots of charm. My major complaint is that the music sometimes gets a little old, and randomly changes levels of volume. Other than that it lost points for the resets to the dashboard, but with knowing some of the background of this game, I throughly enjoyed it and felt it was well worth the $10",8,10
metacritic,ShaggyHermit,fez,"This game could be **** it ever worked. In the intro alone there was a fatal error that caused the game to crash and restart. I tried again, only to have it crash on me a second time.

It's a shame really as the game could be **** I could play it.",2,10
metacritic,Schmooblidon,fez,"It is such a shame that a lot of people are giving such bad reviews just because the developer had an opinion you disagreed with. It really shows the true face of the internet, an **** Do you feel invincible behind your screen? Do you enjoy hurting one another? You are the cancer of the internet, you do not deserve it. As for my review of this game, its god damn amazing. I'd like to address the negative points that are being told. People are claiming it to be just a simple flash game, with no challenge, no objective and just a gimmick holding it together. It is far from simple. There is a HUGE amount of challenge, you just haven't realised it. The intention of the game was to create a non-threatening environment to explore. You respawn when you fall for a reason, there are no enemies, no bosses for a reason. The game encourages you to explore at your own pace. It gives you a simple objective of collecting cubes, but its up to you to find the new clue, and to solve the puzzle that is Fez. The game is nothing short of fantastic. It had me writing sheets of symbols down to try and solve it, sheets of ridiculous theories that made just a tiny bit of sense in my brain. I kept searching and finding more clues, just this game did not hold my hand, it set me free into its world. The presentation is also great, the visuals are very clean and crisp, and the environments are beautiful. The music is astounding and definiately one of Disasterpeace's best albums to date. Its simply gorgeous. I haven't come across any bugs or crashs like a lot of people are complaining about, little hiccups here and there are the worst of my experiences. Please do not trust the negative reviewers, they are simply trying to hurt, destroy, our internet.",10,10
metacritic,Billy_Basso,fez,"One of my favorite games so far this year.. The fact that it required the internet -- the collective hive-mind of humanity -- over a week to solve the last puzzle is unprecedented. Solving some of the puzzles in this game without help is one of the most rewarding experiences gaming has to offer right now.

The art's beautiful. The sound track's awesome. The elements of the world make so much sense together, it's almost kind of magical.

The only problem I have with it is the inconsistent frame rate. Hopefully, when Phil Fish gets around to porting it this to PC, that will no longer be an issue.

Highly recommended.",10,10
metacritic,futaihikage,fez,"FEZ on the whole, presents an atypical approach to its world design by presenting a pixelated 2D world in 3D terms.  The concept of turning 2D to 3D isn't new; this concept can be seen in Paper Mario (by Nintendo) and Crush (by Sega).  What is new is the use of pixels instead of completely flat polygons.  This is a credit to Renaud BÃ¨dard's programming ability, even though he's new to the game programming realm, the world he coded for FEZ with those pixels is warm, cute and somewhat inviting; however, its not very engaging.  There's nothing that draws you personally into FEZ's world and you don't get the same sense of imminent danger that the game wants to present to you.

FEZ's story is that he has to find smaller bits of larger cubes in order to keep his world from disappearing.  But you don't get a sense of that at all in the game's world, from the initial explanation of the story at the beginning of the game nor at the end of the game.  None of the non-playable characters give you that sense either.  So, since there are no time limits, ""lives"", or much of a story, you end up with an experience that has only the following three elements left: The 2D world that's viewable in three dimensions, exploration and puzzles.

The 2D spin-able world looks nice.  The color palette has a nice range of colors, but your eyes will beg for more.  AT least mine were like that, I definitely desired to see more depth and variations in the color choices as I played the game.  The creators of this game wanted it to be some kind of love letter to old games in the past, so you're only getting a color palette that's a bit better than what the original Nintendo Entertainment System could display.  Moving around FEZ's world feels a bit slow due to how the main character moves and I did have one or two issues with the game play itself.  After playing for an hour or more, when I went to spin the world to get another perspective to see what I had to jump on next, this action seems to happened slower and slower with each passing minute I played over that hour.  When that started to happen, jumping became a minor issue as the movement would stutter.  Like many other users, I did experience the crash back to the Xbox's Home screen.  Fortunately, I felt that these didn't make the game unplayable, as you can quickly get back to where you left off if you restart your Xbox if these problems start occurring.  I'm hoping a future patch will clear these issues up.  The map isn't very helpful in finding where you are and where you've been, so I mostly skipped it in favor keeping track of places with that notebook I was using to keep puzzle hints.

As for the puzzles, which outside the 2D/3D thing, is the core of FEZ, there's not much I can say without giving away hints or cause spoilers to appear in this review.  The puzzles do range from the very easy, like pushing a block onto a switch to some more obtuse and abstract puzzles where being observant is the key to figuring out the answer, which allows you to get another cube piece.  I think Brain Lord for the SNES had harder puzzles to figure out.  But I can't really compare those two games since they are different experiences all around in navigating to the next puzzles with in the game world.

Finally to the exploration aspect of the game; which I thought was a bit tough to do.  Most puzzle platformers give you something to draw you into the experience.  Since many of these games like FEZ rely heavily on puzzles, most of them bring you into the experience by using sound effects or music.  Unfortunately for FEZ, the music is a selection of soft ambient tunes; they were so soft at times, it felt almost nonexistent to me.  The chiptune sounds aren't bad in the slightest, they are wonderfully composed pieces.  But having something with a bit more pep or using music to add to the tension would have gone a long way in making the game more enjoyable while you're wandering around collecting cubes and solving puzzles.

How to wrap up this review?  I think all in all, this is a wonderful tech demo and not a fully fleshed out game.  I didn't experience the mind numbing brilliance that many other reviewers had seen when they played FEZ.  However, it has a nice pixelated world spinning mechanic, some soft ambient music and puzzles that will keep you coming back, especially if you're a perfectionist.   I don't think this game was fully realized and it feels lacking in some aspects.  Buy this game if you're looking for a game you can slowly complete with you don't have anything else to play or on rainy days.  There's no pressure, from the main character or his world.  Think of MYST for PC in terms of puzzles and pressures to complete the game, mix in ambient chiptunes, a ""retro"" graphics engine and you have FEZ.",4,10
metacritic,kelanflyter,fez,"Fez is a game that could have been good... but it's not the case. Graphics are maybe 16bits, but lazy ones. Same thing for the soundtrack. Controls are unsensitives, and worst af all, the game concept is a bad copy of the Crush's one (Crush is a Sega game retailed on PSP and 3DS).
I love retro gaming, i'd be pleased if more of retro games were coming, but good ones, not like Fez.",4,10
metacritic,retrobeans,fez,"Fez is a charming and quirky platformer with nostalgia inducing 16-bit graphics and an awesome ambient chiptune soundtrack. The gameplay is simple 2D platforming with a ""Super Paper Marioesque"" 3D rotation gimmick, it's been implemented very well and the level design is fantastic. Whilst shallow on the surface there is an extra layer to the game with a decipherable language used to find secrets and read hidden messages. The map design is genius and allows you to track your progress of each area
perfectly. My only negative is the relative ease, Fez does not punish you for mistakes, whilst this does make the game more accessible I found it reduced the challenge and satisfaction from completing each area.

Still, this is one of the better games XBLA has to offer and definitely recommended.",8,10
metacritic,junker,fez,Unfortunately I'm seeing a lot of reviews saying this game is unoriginal but I find that to be quite hilarious. I've never played any other game like this and I LOVE the fact that they put out a retro style game in the sea of games being released now a days. I honestly think everyone should give this a try. If you're not a fan of puzzle/platform games it's not for you. Take it as it is and enjoy Fez!,9,10
metacritic,Broyax,spelunky,"Eh bé, voici un petit bonhomme au nez tout rouge (parce que c’est un clown ou parce qu’il est alcoolo ?) avec une casquette qui fait penser au petit plombier communiste de chez Nintendaube : comme lui, il saute partout sauf qu’il s’est pris pour Indiana Jones.

Hélas, beaucoup trop de marrons pour Tendaube qui n’en a point voulu (le marron, c’est caca) : pas de kart rigolol non plus, même pas de champignons magiques ! Heureusement (!) la réalisation en 16 couleurs de ce « jeu » (lol ?) en 2D est d’une fraîcheur très indé ! à savoir qu’elle est débectante (c’est repoussant de laideur). Tant pis si ça ressemble à un jeu de plate-formes pourrave de la fin des années 80, du moment que cela peut émerdeveiller le public rétron très friand du genre !

metacritic,ZackH25,spelunky,One of the most unique games I have ever played. It is a bit like Mario on steroids. Very smart the game changing every time you die so you either have to get good or you are doomed. The are a bunch of fun items and characters to mess around with. The best level for me was the forest level. Jetpack is OP and bombing rules is so much easier and so satisfying when it saves you crossing a floor full of spikes and spiders. One of the hardest rougelikes I have ever played and beaten.,8,10

metacritic,Thunderjohn,spelunky,"As a retro games fan, this one hits all the right notes. A friend of mine recommended it, and I can't thank him enough. Sure difficulty is a thing, but I like challenge a lot. It's a platform masterpiece, hard but rewarding. It's not for everyone though. Give it a try if you enjoy retro platformers such as Super Meat Boy etc.",10,10
metacritic,the_Slugman,spelunky,"One of the best games of all time. Intricate, insanely difficult, charming, and completely addictive. You'll have nightmares about the run where you got a jetpack and a shotgun on at 200m and then that stupid ****ing arrow trap launched you into a piranha plant. BULL****!!!

No platform/roguelike game has collected more of my hours (original and modern version combined) and kept me coming back more. No run will ever be the same, and nothing seems to be lacking (other than the loss of the ability to chuck arrows into walls [woe is me]). I absolutely cannot wait to see what Derek Yu comes up with next, as this was an absolute masterpiece.

I do wish there were more minibosses or goals to go along with the game (yes, I'm familiar with everything that's available in the game and have been to hell) – would be nice to have a better reason to explore outside of the beaten path.

Again, one of the best games of all time. Well done, sir.",9,10
metacritic,JadenF,spelunky,"Okay,Spelunky is an Action-Platformer,where if you are a casual gamer,you have a high chance to not like this **** game is cut up into 4 sections,with 4 areas inside of each ****,if you die,it's back to the beginning. This game is brutal,so brutal it took me over 600 runs to beat it my first **** game does fell very satisfying to complete though,and it has very good stylized and pretty graphics,and the music is awesome.This game also has co-op,and might be fun to play with a friend for a few laughs,and bursts of **** game has even a hidden hard mode,but I won't spoil the ""fun"" in finding **** I guess you could just look it **** game also has an Arena Mode,but playing with bots is very frantic,and might not interest you for very **** game is very fun,but only for the people who like  losing a bunch before finishing this game.Casuals will get very frustrated with the game's very tight and responsive controls.This game will test you,and if you are not ready,it will annihilate you,but every death feels as though it was your fault. If you like good music,responsive controls and a game that will destroy you,this is for you.",9,10
metacritic,PizzaMasta,spelunky,"This game is the type of games that will get bad reviews from some hasty people. Why? Because it is excruciatingly hard. Completing even the first level may seem like an overwhelming challenge at first, but one you'll overcome with patience and practice.Standing only at sixteen (actually twenty) levels before the ''final'' boss, four for each of the worlds, the game may seem like a pretty short and simple platformer, but here comes the twist. Every single time you die (and it will happen, A LOT), you respawn at the very first level of the Mines (1-1), but it is not the same 1-1 you just went through, it is randomly generated like every other level, meaning that in a thousand successful games you would never encounter the same layout twice. In addition to that, a plethore of different enemies. events and items will keep you hooked until you know the ins and outs of everything Spelunky and you can reliably (or almost) kill Olmec on most runs. The charming art style makes it a pleasure to look at, with every of the 16 characters being unique enough to warrant a little playtime. Couch co-op and deathmatch help extend the already infinite replayability of Spelunky and add a little more chaos and family ruining fun to your spelunking evenings too!

Aside from some minor nitpicks, such as bothering multiplayer bugs and the lack of updates compared to other versions of Spelnuky HD, this game is a brilliant masterpiece, and one proof that gameplay still is at the very core of the enjoyment ****, even when there is no story involved, at all. Go and try it, you will die at every trap, but I promise, you will soon be riding Olmec into Hell, collecting every diamond the nefarious ghost can grant you.",9,10
metacritic,monster_meal,spelunky,"The art style is amazing charming, the gameplay is tight and awesome.  This is truly the kind of game I'm pretty sure I used to dream about when I was a kid playing the NES.  It's different everytime, it rewards patience and caution, and when you start to make it to later levels you really get a sense that your skill has grown.  The multiplayer is mayhem, and it's absolutely fun working with your friends to survive the depths!",8,10
metacritic,drlowdon,spelunky,"A 2d platformer the aim of Spelunky is simply to make it to the bottom of each stage. Of course things are not quite that simple and the game will very quickly begin to throw all manner of enemies and challenges your way. Fortunately the controls are excellent meaning deaths always feel like they’re your fault rather than the fault of the game.

What will put some people off however is the level of difficulty. Much like platformers from the 8-bit era and earlier every time you die in Spelunky you have to start right from the beginning again. The fact that the levels are randomly generated each time does go some way to mitigating any frustration this may cause, particularly early on in proceedings, but many people will feel the game crosses the line from challenging into downright unfair as it progresses. Still I’d recommend to anyone to give Spelunky a try for themselves.",7,10
metacritic,cstrickland,spelunky,"I loved this game so much when I bought it, I feel it was worth buying. It's frustrating at times but it's addicting just trying to make it further and further, the addition of shortcuts/tunnels in this game were a great idea, sometimes it's hard to make it through levels and it would have **** having to start from the beginning.

Great game.",8,10
metacritic,FearBeard,spelunky,"the best rogue-like on the 360, the dungeon randomizes everytime you play, enemy encounteres are always varied and unique, and so many secrets to be found like going inside of a worm, castle, black market that you'll always find something new. this game is the crowning achievement of ""just one more time"" syndrom. ive spent 2hrs playing this game, saying ""just one more"" time after i die.",10,10

metacritic,BorisMagee4444,spelunky,"I have put countless hours into this game since release. Each time I play I learn something new, and there is an incredible amount of depth and nuance to the gameplay. While there are some systematic problems with the game (such as the randomized nature resulting in the very occasional cheap death), I have fallen in love with Spelunky. If you are a patient gamer who loves to get personal with every facet **** (and recieve great rewards for doing so), pick this game up. I did on release day, and haven't stopped playing since.",9,10
metacritic,Lhuth,spelunky,"Spelunky is singly the most frustrating game I have ever played, yet this somehow only adds to the sense of satisfaction when you finally edge a single level further than the time before. If you go into this game expecting the classic 2D platformer that you can breeze through and complete with ease, then you",9,10
metacritic,LazyChan,spelunky,"Spelunky is a fantastic and fun platformer. Be warn it is hard, and there will be plenty of dying. Old school gamers will feel right at home playing such a difficult game. Ninja Gaiden, Mega Man, Mario etc. were all very hard. But their gameplay revolve around trial and error. Spelunky revolves around learning the game mechanics. There is no trial and error because every stage is randomly generated and each playthrough is unique. You progressively get better and when you complete the game, it is an accomplishment. It is a deep intrinsic game and you are guaranteed to come back even after dying dozens of time. Every death is the player's fault and that is what makes the game so great. It is not ""cheap"" in the traditional sense. It is very hard but fair.

The controls are very responsive. It might kill you the first few times but after learning the core mechanics, you'll never fight against it. Multiplayer is great fun. Coop is just a mess of fun, with friends killing and sabotaging each other while trying to reach the end of a stage. Deathmatch is chaotic with bombs flying everywhere and plenty of wtf death. It's shallow but great for a quick laugh.

I wish there was online coop play, split screen multiplayer, and an online coop leaderboard. Why omit a leaderboard for cooperative play, I'll never know. Despite these cons, the game is still a blast. 1200 msp seems a bit steep but fans of the platforming genre own it to themselves to check out this game. For everyone else, give it a try before buying. I'm sure many of you will agree this game is a hidden gem among the xbla library.",9,10
metacritic,SilverMan,spelunky,"I exaggerated on my last review of this game. It is a great game, the game play is good, the visual is incredible, the history is simple, the enemies are awesome. But the game has some problems that is hard not to notice, such as: when in multiplayer, only the first player can buy things and the camera is focused on him; when you die, you start all over again; sometimes, 5 lives is not enough, some enemies and traps take more than 1 life of you, and there's nothing on the levels to regenerate a life; when you get hit by something, you stay too much time unconscious and in this little frame of time, someone or something can kill you.",6,10
metacritic,KongKK,spelunky,Excellent game that rewards and punishes appropriately. All your actions have risk / rewards and the sense of adventure feels so real. The controls may be tricky at the beginning but after awhile you will realise that they are ingenius. I'm not a fan of 2d platformers but this game is one hell of an exception.,9,10
metacritic,damienelp,spelunky,"I wasn't expecting a lot from this game when I first heard about it. Sure I love retro-gaming and this one looks like a refurbished game from the eigthies (which it actually is). First time I tried it, looks particularly hard, because I kept dying over and over again. Sometimes I could die in less that 15 seconds. Could be frustrating to some, but for me it was challenging. As in Super meat boy you have to retry many times before getting the hang of it, but when you reach a new randomize level, it's very rewarding. I have yet to finish the game but I won't give up until I do. I would recommend this game to everybody who is willing to put some effort in game. As far as I'm concerned, Spelunky is the best XBLA game since Super Meat Boy, hands down !",10,10
metacritic,buningchaos,spelunky,"Rad game, but I really wish you could keep your stuff when you died. The randomness is what sells the game for me. It seems like anything could pop up in the game. Easy deaths are never cheap, but make me feel like a moron.",8,10
metacritic,StinkMitts,spelunky,"Though Spelunky's price of 1200points may seem steep for what seems like a re-port of an old classic, but the game speaks for its self. The addition of the co-op mode is worth the 1200 alone. The other user reviews are correct, if you dont like this game it is probably to hard for you, and the frustration factor will turn you off. If you are a gamer like me, however, this is the kind of challenging game you strive for in this world of CoDs and Gears of Wars where with every death there is a close by checkpoint and almost no sense of real danger. There is no mindless killing set to a direct path in Spelunky, a trait that has been all but lost on the new age of gaming and is a breath of fresh air for the XBLA. There was a reason we all spent are allowance every week back in the cartridge days renting these games over and over again never to even come close to beating them. BECAUSE THE CHALLENGE IS THE FUN. After every time you leave a door to a deeper more difficult stage of the caves, you feel you have ACTUALLY accomplished something, very rare in the modern gaming age where everything is determined by achievements or trophies, which could not produce a MORE hollow feeling of accomplishment. I am a big FPS fan and love all graphical advancements in gaming as much as the next guy, but there is something to be said for a game that can port from 16bits and be this good! Give me a giant machine gun and endless enemies to kill and you dont have to be that creative to make the game entertaining. But with a ""simple"" game like Spelunky, i use quotations because the action and adventure are FAR from simple, you have to create an atmosphere in the game that MAKES it interesting. Trust me your 100th death on stage 1-5 wont cause you to drop the game, and THAT ladies and gentlemen, is a full bodied PERSONAL achievement, not just a ghost of a former accomplishment that xbox has deemed ""An Acheivement""! Those hundred deaths actually feel worth it! But i digress...
Controls are smooth as butter. Though it can get extremely frustrating at times, the game was not constructed to be easy. It is definitely aimed at true gamers who have been playing these types of games since the years of nes, snes, genesis, and other similar systems. The frustration is almost what generates the fun aspect of the adventure. What fun is a game with no sense of underlying danger?! In Spelunky you are never more than one or two misplaced jumps away from being sent all the way back to the beginning of the cave to start your adventure again, stripped of everything you may have earned on your way. This sounds like a detrimental aspect of the game, but the beauty of it is that every time you start again you are playing a a totally different game! The levels are all randomly generated every time you enter a door, so there is no grinding repetition of beating the same baddies 50 times over before you finally advance to a new area. This is  also where the seemingly overpowering cost of the game fades away. The replay value on spelunky is great, especially since your life is at stake 100% of the time, causing great deal of tension in each stage.
All in all:
Visual: very impressive for a 16 bit port. Colours are nice, bombs look great and the controls really, really complement the graphical style of the game as everything feels as smooth as it looks.
Gameplay: single player and co-op both offer a great experience, have yet to try the deathmatch mode but it looks promising. The tension created by always being seconds from death and a full restart keep the game very exciting and permits a great amount of replay value.
Replay Value: Every time you play it is a different experience as the game generates each stage independently and randomly with continuously more grave amounts of danger and pleasing amounts of treasure!
Sound: Music is great, sound effects fit the game style could use music more to create tension, but the game is difficult enough to give you that feeling on its own
Controls: Easy to learn because the game flows so smoothly, though it will take you time to master your adventurers skills to be a prosperous treasure hunter.
IN CONCLUSION: Don't let the price scare you off, Spelunky may look like a cheesy remake of an old-school adventure platformer, but it is far from that. It is a crisp, fun, challenging and, best yet, never ending romp through the creative caves on your quest for the ultimate treasures!

IF U ARE A *TRUE* GAMER AND CAN DEAL WITH THE DIFFICULTY LEVEL THAT GAMES USED TO BRING US... OR IF YOU HAVE AT LEAST ONE OTHER FRIEND TO HELP YOU ON YOUR QUEST FOR RICHES, GET THIS GAME!...                                         ...WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR, GET IT!",9,10
metacritic,admanwhitmer,spelunky,"risk, reward. these words describe many of the situations that you will encounter in this game. i only have one heart, should i leave safely, or risk trying to save the damsel... or should i try to rob the shopkeeper even though there is a good chance i will die. these situtations occur frequently and they will decide whether you venture far into the journey or be locked in the caves. this game also takes patience... lots of it... also it takes a good amount of skill. sometimes it may take hours of trying to accomplish your goal but that makes the moment of victory all the sweeter. spelunky is not for the feint of heart but if you are determined and patient this game can be a real gem, i highly recommend playing, it truly is another indie victory with the likes of super meat boy and limbo",10,10
metacritic,Hathor,spelunky,"People who don't like this game is because they think it's too difficult to them... it's a platform game, like the ones we saw in NES and SNES. Like said before, if you don't like ""hard"" games you will hate this one, but if you a real gamer, you will like it, or at least apreciate the work in it, if you don't play it to the end. Like FEZ and other retro games, it frustrate the players who like a ""modern"" and easy game. This game is a masterpiece of retro games, so if you like the style, buy it.",10,10
metacritic,Xborn74,spelunky,"Spelunky is a XBLA game costing 1200MS Points, based on an Indie game that was released for PC in 2008, and consists of a 2D platform game with old-style gameplay, as we saw in 8 and 16 bit consoles. The basic game is the prerogative of an explorer, after an Aztec artifact, which has to go through various underground levels and stages, to the exit of them.

The Graphics of the game are simple, but the XBLA version won a updated look, being cleaner and more polished, still maintaining the old-style look, but being attractive, with a more ""lively"" and colorful. Everything else, like Menus keeps the air retro game. The CG animation of the game use to tell the story and have a simple air, but more refined.

Audio: songs and voices are simple, but with a good audio, and effects, and voiceovers (in animation) are consistent with the actions and what you see, but still keeping the classic look we see in graphics.

Gameplay: here is concentrated the greatest attraction of the game - the game has a series of 14 levels, which should be circulated with controls typical of the old platform games, and using some objects to help walk the galleries and avoid hazards such as spikes, sags and enemies, ranging from the simplest like snakes to advanced ones, like ghosts.

You have objects like a rope (to climb up or down from a session), pumps (used to break the floor or walls) and a whip (to break objects or kill enemies), and other items that are being released with the progression in the game (such as jet packs).

The Levels has the objective to reach the exit using its limited and scarce resources, and in the meantime, picking up treasures and rescuing characters if you want. You can make your way using the items, or try to cross using pre-established paths, but keeping the retro look, nothing is as easy as it sounds.

If you die, you'll be returned to the initial stage of the game, and added to that, we have the fact that the levels are random generated, never a stage will be equal to each other and never the difficulty will be predetermined.

Summary: the game is a very good classic platform game, with a retro air, but it presents a difficulty that may disappoint many people, but to please players who like games more hardcore platform games - the price is a little salty, 800ms points would be better.",8,10
metacritic,DME,spelunky,"The cool thing about Spelunky is its randomly generated levels so that you have a different experience every time you play. The platforming itself is well done and the controls are very responsive. I have yet to die and blame it on the game.  But dying is so easy.  One careless mistake and it's game over.  You have to be constantly aware of your surroundings and plan your every move.  There's also a shop in random levels.  I initially liked the idea of how you could rob the shopkeeper and have him hunt you down for all future levels to come, but unfortunately this idea was executed terribly.  The shopkeeper acts as though you just slaughtered his whole family and bounces around the place like an idiot firing his shotgun the second he sees you.  There's also a time limit on each level, forcing you to act quickly and make hasty decisions.  The graphics are very nice and the audio compliments.  Lots of replay value.  If you have any interest whatsoever, I highly recommend downloading the demo on XBLA, as it offers a very deep experience for a trial.",8,10
metacritic,DeadMansHand,spelunky,"Got the game based on reviews. Liked the game itself, but found it a bit too difficult for my tastes. There is a fine line between challenging and frustrating.

If you do, it's a masterpiece, one of the best examples of a small-but-oh-so-fun arcadey experience which is infinitely replayable and deep. Other reviewers obviously don't know what they're in for. A couple of hints: i) after the tutorial, every level is randomly generated EVERY TIME you play it. You can't learn the levels like other games: you have to be actually good at PLAYING it, it requires skill and practice to get better and learn how to deal with issues. ii) It's goddamn unforgiving. Hand in hand with point i), this game will take you apart repeatedly until you learn to do things like: avoid running under spiders, drop things in front of arrow traps, save ropes and bombs more than money, GET THE CLIMBING GLOVES AS FAST AS YOU CAN, stay the damn hell out of a yeti's armreach... And so on. It's wonderfully deep and infinitely new and fresh. GET IT AND ENJOY IT, FOLKS. (The only issues I've noted are very, very rare bugs and... That's it.

You really have to learn to be careful or you will die by carelessness. You will die, die again, and then die some more, but with each death you learn a little more about the game, and how to survive. As for the controls, they're very responsive, and I've yet to die because of them. And the graphics are really great as well. It's a crisp HD look that suits the game. So all in all, it looks like a fun game that will take a long time to master. But oddly, I think that's ok.",9,10

The controls are great, the items useful and fun, and it has great variety based on the endless iterations of the various levels.

metacritic,Takeoff,spelunky-2,"This game had the potential to provide a rewarding, challenging and fun experience. Instead it loves throwing stun locks and one shot kills in your face. Punishing mechanics aren't necessarily a flaw, but the way they've been implemented here make the experience very frustrating. Some of the traps are also quite cheap, since some of them can trigger when they aren't fully on screen. 

The randomness is something that makes this game very unique even amongst other rogue-likes. Sometimes it results in you getting powerful items early on, other times it sends off screen objects hurdling towards you through no fault of your own.

The game definitely needed a bit more time in the oven to iron out any balancing issues. But based on what the developers have said, it seems like they don't see cheap deaths as problem. Its just ""a part of the game"". If there's one thing that's clear, the game really doesn't respect or care about your time",0,10

metacritic,Ofdoom,spelunky-2,"The software lacks any save, checkpoint or level codes (as were implemented on 1980s NES games that lacked the technology to store saves) as such you basically have to replay the same first few levels endlessly. I suspect the designers put some effort into the later levels but decided they do not want players to ever see them. This design is the equivalent of taking the script for ""A Few Good Men"" and instead making 19 seasons of NCIS and airing them in no particular order. Many TV viewers are happy to watch the same story over and over but they would not be happy if they went to a movie theatre and were shown a random sampling of NCIS episodes until they walked out.
Even Mega Man (released in 1987) allowed you to replay levels until you turned your system off, by Mega Man 2 codes were provided to restore progress. Mega Man has released many sequels and will continue to be enjoyed long after Spelunky is forgotten.
The online multiplayer has terrible latency, I assume this was done on purpose to make the game more difficult for the bizarre fans of this ""genre"".
The fans of this software certainly value feeling elite very highly and they would be very susceptible to a cult. This software contains interesting pieces that could have been used to make a game however the developers instead have made a challenge which could have been one possible game mode.",0,10

Superior to HD in every way except the music IMO but I turned that off in both games fairly early on.

There are so many secrets to be found and end game content to keep even the best players engaged for 100+ hours.

Yes, it's harder than HD. No, that's not a bad thing.

Early on I felt the game was unfair sometimes but with experience I have come to blame myself for the vast majority of my deaths.

Derek Yu and Blitworks have been pushing out updates since lauch to make it the best possible experience.

A masterpiece, in my opinion.",10,10

Probably the best rogue-like platformer ever made.",10,10
metacritic,RetroberryPi,spelunky-2,"A perfectsequel to an already perfect original.  Bigger, faster, more colourful, more imaginative, more stylish and MUCH more difficult than the original in every conceivable way. Even after more than 15,000 playthroughs of the original (killing King Yama more than 200 times in the process), I still feel like a complete Spelunky noob once again. And despite my high early death count, I'm absolutely loving it.

Spelunky 2 is a masterpiece; proof that Derek Yu's almost impossible quest to improve upon the original more than justified the extended delays to the game's highly-anticipated launch. Proceed with extreme caution though - as good as this game ultimately is, it will definitely frustrate the less-than-hardcore gamers out there. Spelunky 2 will undoubtedly be responsible for damage to hundreds of PS4 controllers (and potentially a few TVs too).

A god amongst roguelikes platformers, and the perfect swan song for the PS4. MIss it at your peril.",10,10
metacritic,Glic2003,spelunky-2,"It's good, certainly, but the first area is very similar to Spelunky, except much more difficult.  This makes the early game feel redundant and exhausting.

metacritic,FredrikM,spelunky-2,"A good sequel, but of course it doesn't reinvent anything. I hold the first Spelunky as one of the best games that I've played and anyone that enjoyed the first game will most definitely find a liking to Spelunky 2. I must admit that I am far from having finished the game yet, but have probably died 200 or 300 times already, with that being said there are a lot of things I have not explored yet. There are some new features and fun things going on and there is only one major flaw I can come to think of: When you get injured/hurt the stun sequence is far too long and since you don't have any invicibility frames a single accident far to often results in a quite unfair perma death, even if you had as much as 6 or 7 HP. Hopefully this will be patched.",8,10

metacritic,JimmieReview,spelunky-2,"Addictive game loop that is plauged with annoying quirks, rng and insane difficulty.

Why is there no way to adjust the difficulty level? If you really wanted to ""welcome newcomers"", this would have been the first thing to include already in the design phase. Feels like a lazy decision to not have.

This game also has lots of annoying quirks, things that surprise you - usually in a bad way. Like how the whip hits things behind you as well. Or how you can drop what you are holding if your standing close to an edge. Im sure some will call it ""attention to details"", but this - and other similar things - just makes the game feel inconsistent and weird.
The core game loop is great, but it is sorely missing a way to adjust the difficulty. This drags the score down a lot for me.

Something that also needs to be brought up is the RNG. The RNG is horrible in this game, sometimes giving you sections of the game where you are doomed to die no matter what you do.
Another thing is the limited visibility, where you drop down only to have something off screen jump at you when you land causing you to die immediately. This is clearly the result of RNG generated levels - no sane level designer would build it in this way. RNG should more be an option for an extension when you are done with the game, not as a replacement for proper level design.
Combine this with save points that are extremely far in between and your in for an infuriating time.
Such a shame - a great opportunity missed is kind of what this game is",5,10
metacritic,Kakashi2,spelunky-2,"First off, I love the original Spelunky. I spent a lot of time with that game and it is a true classic to me. Having said that I've soured on Spelunky 2. The game itself is a rouglike but there are some repeating elements that happen on every run (like fighting a boss on the 4th level). The problem is the gameplay loop results in doing the same exact tasks followed rng/randomgess making the player do the same tasks, encounter something new and die, and then spend time doing the same tasks again to try to progress. The complexity of making it to the secret area is more frustrating than fun. The liquid dynamics look great but can create some levels that seem a little unfair. Oh and a big thing is taming animals takes too much time. So runs can also feel like they are wasting time followed by a death that's hard to predict.",5,10

metacritic,Zapro11,spelunky-2,"Easily the best platformer ever, the original had a great concept but levels felt empty and weren't very detailed or complex, they were clearly the result of an algorithm. Furthermore the game felt very barebones and it was lacking when it comes to content, however the sequel improves so much on the formula of the original that these issues are non existent in this game. Levels feel designed and man made, they don't feel like the result of an algorithm even though they are, this is extremely impressive and thanks to this there are an infinite amount of unique and fun levels. Furthermore the game is also extremely varied and has a huge amount of content, it switches biome/world every 4 levels and has more of them than the original, there is also a huge amount of enemy types so you definitely wont get bored. The game is also challenging, like old school platformers which is a definite plus in my book. It has a very nice progression system too. Its mechanics are very well made and very polished. Furthermore the controls are very tight and responsive. The art style is great, much better than the originals imo. This game is perfect. The price is too cheap for what you get.

metacritic,alza2,cave-story-plus,"It doesn't feel good to play. The character is ""floaty"".

It's frustrating and not fair. specially bosses. Usually, the save points are not too far but far enough that you have to do some not enjoyable platforming and kill some enemies before you fight the boss again. Dialogues cannot be skipped, so you have to listen again before the fight.

I gave up at Monster X. You get stuck on the wheels and cannot move after having lost huge amount of life. with projectiles everywhere you cannot see anything. Even if you manage to avoid the wheels.

I realized I didn't have much fun playing it. If the game is so punishing it should at least feel good playing and have a good story. So far the story can be summarized in few lines.

I absolutely loved the story, the soundtrack, the gameplay, the difficulty, basically everything. Many label it as a Metroidvania, which I would say it's not (it's actually quite linear). One man (under the name Pixel) created this game (it took him 5 years to do it) and this has got me curious about other single-person creations, like Axiom Verge, Iconoclasts, etc. You can technically still play it for free on PC (it has always been available for free), but then you're missing out on a bunch of cool extras.

Also there are multiple OSTs to pick from with each giving the game a unique vibe! Though,  the Steam version can probably mod that stuff in.

However some of the sad moments I didn't like so I felt more of the need to finish it.  I love how even though the game is a metroidvania, it's more linear than the usual ones. I also like how the level up system works.  It rewards you for being good at the game.  With the controls, I honestly felt like it could've been a gameboy advance game.

metacritic,sarisa,cave-story-plus,"I really don't understand high notes for this game. The worst for me is that just hi scores motivated me to buy this game. It was mistake.

Great music? Maybe I got different version of this game? It's just set of very dull 8bit clicks. It's awful. Please, just compare to Octopath Traveler to see what does it really mean good music in video game before using that term. Truth to be told, if not by music, perhaps it would score 5 or even 6/10.

In terms of story it's very immature (in terms of ""script"", not 18+stuff of course). Not that I have something to this crazy story. It's just constant feeling like if author made all of this without deeper idea.

Graphics is OK - given what sort of game it is.

The best would be to compare this game to other of the like. Axiom Verge is very good comparison to Cave Story+: also made by one person, also 8bit metroidvania. But Axiom is just far, far, far better in all aspects: story (especially story), gameplay & music.

In terms of ""metroidvania"" Cave Story+ is rather average representative of genre, that didn't live up to my expectations.",4,10

I’ve played about 50 games on the switch and this was one of few that I was completely drawn into right away, and played every day until I beat it.  Gameplay reminds me of megaman games for the NES, but with a better story and some rpg elements. Oh, and there are multiple endings, and you can see them all in the same run!

Controls are a bit floaty, and although a lot of the enemies are cool, the level designs aren't particularly interesting, in my opinion. Overall, I felt a lot more frustrated than satisfied with this game.",5,10
metacritic,XV_,cave-story-plus,"There are some one-person-made games that have attained a lot of praise but to me, the most noteworthy might be Cave Story, it has an irresistible charm in every aspect imaginable, and when you hit the credits cutscene you'll be prompted to start a new game+ right away.

Cave Story has stellar and commendable gameplay, it blends platforming and shooting beautifully, always giving you balanced challenge and rewarding jumps. It's structured like a Metroidvania type of game borrowing a little the shooting and platforming aspects from Metroid and a similar narrative structure from Castlevania, although it is its own thing. Story-wise, I was hooked immediately with the art direction and music, the script is great and has an unbelievable and seamless tone shift between whimsical, comedic and often darker moments, its simply brilliant.

Speaking of its length, its a relatively short experience, it took me roughly 5.30 hours to complete but having several endings and combinations, it is a positive thing, which makes it more replayable. The music is also incredible, and it hits the right notes to set the mood in each area, and sometimes it cuts abruptly to make a moment more dramatic.

This edition comes with a little soundtrack cd and an instruction manual with some cool artwork and hints in it, it also has a co-op local mode which I couldn't try, and you can shift freely between original graphics or remastered, is it also possible to change the style of music in 4 variations; original, remastered, rock instrumental (?) and a one that sounds more chiptune than the others, it's not necessary but it makes your replays more enjoyable.

There's not a big issue within this game, some bosses are way too easy and the last boss can be a little frustrating but that's all, it doesn't ruin your experience at all, maybe the jumping physics are a little hard to grasp at the beginning but nothing too bothersome.

Overall I'll recommend this game to anyone who owns a Switch and especially those Metroidvania fans, it has a balanced challenge and interesting story that is kind of hard to put the control down.",9,10

Cave Story+ has some very crisp pixel art, fantastic music, weird but adorable characters, and a vague story.  The gameplay consists of precise platforming and shooting enemies with various weapons you will find throughout your journey that has an interesting mechanic of collecting experience to level up your weapon.  The game is linear in the sense that you won't have to discover areas and instead move through one level to another.  The bosses are interesting and fun, but won't offer much of a challenge.  There are multiple endings you can go for, but just be warned that if you want the best ending, be prepared to work for it.  My criticisms are that the length is incredibly short and you could probably beat it in one sitting, and that the $30 price tag is a bit much for a digital purchase, so I recommend picking up the physical version.

The original of this game was developed by Daisuke Amaya and was able to download for free on PC.

If you've never played cave story you missed a great game.

I still find the game very enjoyable. CV+ looks stunningly gorgeous on  Nintendo Switch's screen. The game box comes with a miniCD music + a manual. I think Nicalis did a good job with the packaging. The art for the cover is awesome. The manual looks beautiful. The miniCD is a nice addition to the whole package. Of course, you can buy this game at a much cheaper price at Steam. But the nice box makes it well worth the $30 price tag *it is $40 for us here in Canada*.

I should point out that the whole original game was made by a single man

A must have for Cave Story original and Metroidvania fans.",9,10
metacritic,SimonH,cave-story-plus,"great game for the Switch. cool story, nice art style, good challenge, great music, etc. it's all there. Get the physical version though, digital is just not worth 30 bucks for a game that you can play for free online. My only criticism is the how the game kinda ""tricks"" you to **** up one of the requirements for the best ending, but to be fair, I think it is recommended that you get the normal ending first.

note - do not play endgame while tripping balls. you die a lot and you will get frustrated, which isn't recommended while tripping.",9,10

metacritic,KAIRST,five-nights-at-freddys,"Five Nights at Freddy's (FNaF 1) is a psychological horror game that quickly became a phenomenon in the indie gaming world. Created by Scott Cawthon, the game features simple mechanics but is extremely effective at creating a tense and terrifying atmosphere.

In the game, you play as a night security guard named Mike Schmidt, who must monitor Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, a place similar to Chuck E. Cheese. However, at night, the animatronics, usually friendly during the day, become aggressive and dangerous. The goal is to survive until morning, using security cameras, doors, and lights to protect yourself from the animatronics, all while managing the limited power supply.

The main strength of FNaF 1 lies in how Cawthon uses the fear of anticipation. The game doesn't rely on grotesque monsters but instead builds an atmosphere of increasing tension, where every movement and sound could signal something about to happen. The jumpscares, while effective, aren’t the only source of fear, making the game more immersive and nerve-wracking.

In terms of gameplay, FNaF 1 features simple mechanics but is challenging. Power management is a key aspect, as you need to balance the use of cameras, lights, and doors without depleting your energy, which can be fatal. The difficulty increases as the nights progress, especially in the later ones, and the presence of an intriguing backstory filled with mysteries adds an extra layer of interest.

Despite its simple graphics and mechanics, Five Nights at Freddy's is a game that knows how to leave an impact. The story is not directly explained but is hinted at through recordings and environmental details, which sparks the player’s curiosity. While the game does have some repetitive elements, it is highly effective in its goal of providing a terrifying experience.

In summary, FNaF 1 is a brilliant example of how a low-budget game can create a memorable experience. It is a must-play for horror fans, expertly manipulating tension and scares to leave a lasting impression.",8,10
metacritic,Luke11,five-nights-at-freddys,"This Game is the Start of one of the best Mascot Horror Franchises ever. You can instantly understand what you need to do, the difficulty gets higher the more you play it, and the Atmosphere is nicely made. If you want to play a Five Nights at Freddy´s game and not get confused by the Lore, play this game",10,10
metacritic,ToyFreddyGamer,five-nights-at-freddys,"Aunque no lo parezca, FNAF 1 es uno de los juegos de terror que mas MIEDO da, en 2014, los juegos de terror se basaban en donde tu te encontrabas sorpresivamente con el MOUNSTRO, en FNAF el mounstro va hacia ti sorpresivamente, las alucinaciones, los easter eggs, el terror claustrofobico y los jumpscares son exquisitos. la jugabilidad de fnaf es muy buena y revolucionaria, el unico problema del juego es que se hace muy REPETITIVO con solo 4 animatronicos.

metacritic,SuperbPlayer,five-nights-at-freddys,"While not ""perfect"" it's a well-balanced game for classic horror games and the first of the franchise of what's to come. The RNG and management of power, doors, lights, and cameras are all more stressful strategy elements than horror, it can still scare you. It's luck-based and also lots of skill required for later nights (i.e.: Nights 6 & 7). Overall as a stand-alone game, it's alright. The only thing keeping this review this solid is the lore behind the game and easter eggs. So if you want a game with a spooky, strategy, and a tad luck-based game: this is it; With fun lore for the future of what's to come.",7,10
metacritic,Bagubuns,five-nights-at-freddys,"While judging this game on its own merits gets less and less interesting with time, I have to give it a lot of credit for its sheer influence, on both my formative teenage years and culture as a whole. This game offers the least out of any other game in the series, and it ends up being the most monotonous, but the idea of micromanaging your battery and the location of animatronics on the map creates a satisfying flow when you nail it down. While its tropes may be a bit tired in the modern day and it didn't age the best, I can't be too harsh on it.",6,10

metacritic,SlippinJimmy_,five-nights-at-freddys,"I know it started it all but its just not that great. I used to be a big Fnaf fan. I still am , but not as much as back then. And this game while it still has some good things , i dont think its that good. Firstly the positives. I still think the animatronics from this game looks the scariest out of all Fnaf games (Even 4. Nightmares arent really that scary , not gonna lie). They just look the most realistic out of all of them. And the jumpscares are the best from the whole series aswell. The game also has a great and earie ambiance. It makes you feel like the place has truly been abandoned. And all the secret lore stuff on the cameras is really smart and cool. But thats all the positives is got. After a while is just realized that many Fnaf **** just boring. And this one is no different. Infact this one might be the most boring. For the first 3 nights the games is just really slow and really easy. Nights 4 and 5 aswell are actually pretty easy. Even Night 6. Becuse the startegy is just simple and boring. Look at Foxy on the cameras ,look at Freddy on the cameras , check the doors and repeat. Hell , apparently you dont even have to look at Foxy becuse just having the cameras open slow him down (i just learned that while writing this review). But yeah , the game is not fun really but i still appriciate it for making this series.",5,10

It's not too scary, but theres a level of uneasiness that is found in this game that isn't found in many games like it.",7,10
metacritic,FPM_tato,five-nights-at-freddys,"Five nights at Freddy’s or FNAF is a fantastic little experience that is plenty fun for a first go. The developer clearly has a knack for making robotic designs and had a lot of ideas for this game. The idea of a sit and survive horror game, while modernly being known as lazy, at the time of this release was an interesting experience. During the first play through is when you’ll have the most interesting and fun experience with this game. Learning the mechanics of the game and the fear of the unknown characters around you is a shocking experience that is unique to this almost tower defense like experience. In terms of gameplay mechanics it’s simple and robust. In terms of story however, is a very complex web of horrors that you truly have to dive into the learn the horrors behind the surface level that infests this game. Both of these elements that make this game a great game, also makes it one that is easy to overlook. The mechanics after you learn the, gameplay wise eventually become tedious. Due to the nature of sit and survive mechanics, at a point it becomes monotonous. Keeping the animatronics out can only be scary for so long and eventually ends up being the biggest down side to this game and the few that come after this game from a sheer replayability standpoint. However the story, as complex and confusing as it is remains as a golden light for this franchise and continues to be what makes FNAF interesting, all stemming from this game right here. Overall, I’d give this game a 5/5 for story and a 3/5 for gameplay. I would recommend this game to someone who has not played nor watched much of this game.",8,10
metacritic,PinnvoPhowns,five-nights-at-freddys,Great game with good story. This was a good game that changed horror for the better or worse (depending how you look at it). But this did nothing wrong and the downfall of Mascot Horror should be blamed on different game. Good game overall.,8,10

metacritic,DarkCncer97,five-nights-at-freddys,"Five Nights at Freeddy's como juego fue algo fresco e inovador.

En la epoca (2014) estaba bastante de moda y ya algo sobrexplotados los juegos tipo Slendermans de coger cierta cantidad de notas mientras un ser te persigue en busca de provocarte un game over... vino Five Nigths at Freddy's a dar un aire fresco a la industria de los juegos de terror que ya existian

El juego trata de que somos un guarda de seguridad que fuimos contratados para vigilar por toda la noche en una pizzeria con unos animatronicos hasta que lleguen las 6AM

El tema esque estos animatronicos llamados: Freddy, Chica, Bonnie y Foxy y una especie de aluncinacion llamada Golden Freddy y estos animatronicos buscaran la manera de entrar a tu oficina para asesinarte y darte un game over

La ambientacion es en lo que mas destaca a mi parecer, hay planos de los animatronicos simplemente terrorificos como el de Bonnie en la sala de repuestos o los 3 animatronicos mirandote fijamente en su estadio y eso combinado a la claustrofobia que provoca el lugar y las risas y sonidos de pasos dan como resultado un muy buena ambientacion

Pero hay unos pequeños problemas en este **** juego en si a las pocas noches se vuelve algo repetitivo por las mecanicas que ya tienen de por si y se vuelve tedioso y aburrido al pasar del tiempo

otro problema son los ya famosos screamer, algunos son decentes mientras que otros no dan nada de miedo ni si quiera ni te das un susto como es el de Foxy o el del Golden Freddy

metacritic,Diogo_Vale,five-nights-at-freddys,"Its amazing, i just gave a 9 because it lacks on story events(I know scott did not know he would make a bunch of games but anyways)",9,10
metacritic,Thaymu,five-nights-at-freddys,"I've played FNaF right after FNaF 2. Apart from it's legendary status, I was expecting some form of a decline in quality because of it's older age. Eventually, I was very pleasantly surprised.

- Gameplay: 7/10
What makes this gameplay more engaging than FNaF 2s? My theory is that, because of the power system, which is actually way more challenging now, the game has to be played with caution. You can't just spam endless patterns because you will simply run out of power before you reach 6AM. overall, it's simple interface together with it's simple mouse controls make this game very pleasant to play. FNaF requires fast reflexes together with intelligent gameplay. I have to admit that the game however is not very difficult for the first 3-4 nights. I don't know if this is a result of the countless hours gameplay that I watched before playing it, or because of the difficulty of the game itself. The option of an extra night + 20/20/20/20 makes it much more fun in my opinion

- Atmosphere: 9/10
FNaF is the definition of chilling. The fact that the kitchen cam is completely blacked-out (which was done to give the player some chance for imagination) is a small but fun detail. It's a dark and grimy office, in which you cannot move. This results in even more of a scaring factor, because it's in most peoples instinct to run away from things that threaten them. The fact that they now have to now face their fears makes it very confronting.

- Jump-scares: 7/10
The jump-scares are overall way better than in FNaF 2s. They are more unpredictable and they have more animation. They do lose their scare after a while, but together with it's atmosphere, it still makes you want to avoid they at all cost.

- Sounddesign: 7/10
The sounddesign is pretty simple but effective. Hearing the animatronics walk, the kitchen noise, the slight noise of the fan, and the overall jump-scare sounds are well made, but they once again lose their fright after a little while

- Lore: 6/10
The lore in FNaF is pretty simple in comparison to the following games. we hear about future events, like the bite of '87 which makes for some cool teasers. Also part of the lore being written on the wall is a nice addition.

- Innovation: 8/10
Scott created a whole series from this game as an independent game developer. This game haas influenced a lot of other games after it, of which it's still one of the best.

- Replay-ability: 9/10
You can play this game for hours and hours. With the addition of the extra night and the 20/20/20/20 mode, its fun but it will also last you a little while before completely finishing the game. Even if you do finish it, it can always be replayed later because of it's RNG-factor

- Price: 9/10
This game is such a steal for only €3,99!

CONCLUSION: The first FNAF is equal to FNAF 2 but at the same time totally different. The gameplay is enjoyable, even tho it's pretty simplistic. This horror game is a base for many others to build upon. If you have some spare money, I would really encourage you to buy this.",8,10
metacritic,FederiXGamer,five-nights-at-freddys,It is for me one of the best horror games the mechanics are very simple but as each game progresses it gives you the feeling that you must become faster this is not a jumpscares simulator,10,10
metacritic,antmaster208,five-nights-at-freddys,"a classic gem. Fnaf is different from most horror games, instead of free roaming, you (a minimum wage security guard) is confined to a office with animatronics coming after you. The atmosphere feels uncomfortable, audio feels immersive and jumpscares really get to you. Unfortunately, most of the sequels fall through with lacking in few areas, but this one feel perfect!",10,10

metacritic,sansbattle1111,five-nights-at-freddys,"Five Nights at Freddy's, developed by Scott Cawthon, has become a sensation in the gaming world, known for its intense jump scares and chilling atmosphere. This indie horror game has amassed a dedicated following and has become a staple in the genre. While it undeniably offers a nerve-wracking experience that keeps players on the edge of their seats, there are some areas where the game falls short, preventing it from reaching its full potential. In this review, we'll delve into the game's strengths, weaknesses, and overall impact on the horror gaming landscape.

One of the standout features of Five Nights at Freddy's is its ability to create an atmosphere of dread and tension. From the moment you enter the dimly lit security office, the game establishes a sense of claustrophobia and impending doom. The flickering lights, the ominous ambience, and the unsettling animatronic characters lurking in the shadows all contribute to an eerie and foreboding environment. The tension builds up gradually as you desperately try to survive the night, anxiously monitoring the animatronics' movements through the security cameras.

The gameplay mechanics in Five Nights at Freddy's are relatively straightforward but effective. As a security guard, your primary objective is to survive five consecutive nights while keeping an eye on the animatronics, which come to life during the night. You must carefully manage your limited resources, such as power for lights and doors, to ward off the animatronics and avoid a gruesome fate. Balancing your actions and conserving power becomes crucial as each night progresses, adding a layer of strategy to the gameplay.

However, some players may find the repetitive nature of the gameplay frustrating. Each night follows a similar pattern, requiring you to monitor the cameras and react accordingly to survive until 6 AM. While the initial nights offer a thrilling experience filled with tension and jump scares, the gameplay loop can become monotonous and predictable over time. More varied challenges or additional gameplay elements could have provided a refreshing break from the repetition and added depth to the overall experience.

Five Nights at Freddy's effectively utilizes its visual and audio design to enhance the horror experience. The animatronic characters, with their uncanny appearances and unsettling movements, create a feeling of unease and discomfort. The low-resolution graphics add to the game's charm, reminiscent of classic horror titles. The audio design plays a significant role in building tension, with ambient sounds and the animatronics' distinct noises contributing to the overall atmosphere. The creaking footsteps and the menacing laughter of Freddy Fazbear himself are sure to send shivers down your spine.

While Five Nights at Freddy's introduces an intriguing and mysterious plot, the game's storytelling falls short in terms of execution and integration. The narrative is mainly conveyed through newspaper clippings, phone messages, and hidden easter eggs, which can be challenging to discover without external sources. This reliance on external material for a complete understanding of the story creates a disjointed experience within the game itself. While the fragmented storytelling approach may appeal to some players who enjoy piecing together the lore, a more coherent narrative integration within the game would have improved the overall engagement and immersion.

Despite its flaws, Five Nights at Freddy's has had a significant impact on the horror gaming landscape. It has captivated players with its intense jump scares, unique premise, and iconic animatronic characters. The game's success has spawned numerous sequels, spin-offs, and a dedicated fan base, solidifying its status as a genre-defining title. Five Nights at Freddy's has inspired a wave of similar horror games, further emphasizing its influence and cultural significance.

Five Nights at Freddy's delivers a tense and iconic horror experience that has left a lasting mark on the gaming industry. Its ability to create an atmosphere of dread and its memorable jump scares have garnered it a dedicated following. However, the game falls short in terms of gameplay variety, interactivity, and narrative integration. While the repetitive gameplay loop and reliance on external material may deter some players, those who appreciate the game's strengths and iconic status will find a chilling and intense adventure in Five Nights at Freddy's.",7,10

metacritic,Alexandros1996,hades,"Sassy dialogues with the gods, fast-paced hack and slash, beautiful otherworldly art. Hades lets the player explore the many layers of hell via Zagreus, the son of the Greek God of Death. Godly powers, relationship building with quirky characters, and magnificent visuals make this roguelite a truly enjoyable experience. Love the little variations in each run, they make it truly deep and never boring!!",9,10
metacritic,donmopa,hades,"Hades is definitely one of those games that's hard to put down. With its fast-paced combat, rich story, and the allure of trying to escape the underworld, it keeps players coming back for more. The roguelike mechanics, where each run offers something new (whether it's power-ups, enemies, or dialogue), make it incredibly replayable. Plus, the characters and their development make you want to see how the story unfolds as you progress. The way it mixes challenge and narrative is a big part of what makes it so ""addictive.""",9,10
metacritic,something420,hades,"This game excels in many areas, starting with its stunning visuals. The art style is captivating, making every moment a feast for the eyes. Gameplay is another standout feature. The sheer variety of tools at the player’s disposal is impressive, and everything feels well-balanced. There are countless wacky builds to experiment with, and while some are more effective than others, none feel outright bad based on my experience. The boss fights are, for the most part, both enjoyable and challenging, adding to the thrill. The soundtrack is another highlight, complementing the gameplay perfectly. As a rogue-lite, the game also offers immense replay value, keeping players coming back for more. 

However, not everything about the game is perfect. My biggest gripe is with Elysium. Everything about this section is infuriating—the weapon-wielding enemies you have to kill twice, the suicide bomber carts, the massive carts that relentlessly chase you, and especially Theseus. If Elysium were removed entirely, the game would instantly be 25% better. On a lighter note, Asterius could really stand to take corners less sharply when charging. Another drawback is how the game feels when played with a mouse and keyboard. While it’s definitely playable this way, I’d strongly recommend using a controller for a smoother experience. Lastly, unlocking certain elements in the game can sometimes be a tedious process, as it heavily relies on RNG, which can test your patience. 

In conclusion, this game is fantastic for anyone who enjoys rogue-lites, action games, Greek mythology, or a combination of the three. It’s a well-crafted experience that shines despite a few frustrating elements. 

P.S. A special shout-out to the game's portrayal of the gods. Their bipolar nature is hilariously accurate to the mythology. One moment they’re cheering you on and showering you with boons, and the next, they’re trying to kill you because you favored another god. Then, as if nothing happened, they’re back to supporting you. Whether you find this fickle behavior annoying or praise it for its faithfulness to the source material, it’s undeniably memorable.",8,10

metacritic,jack441,hades,"The best rogue-like I've ever played. The game-play loop is fantastic, the action is fast paced and satisfying and the build variety is great. It also has a solid permanent progression unlocks, unlike some other games of the genre. The heat system (optional increasing difficulty) is also very innovative.
My only, minor, complaints are that enemy variety does not change even on high heat levels (except the main bosses ofc), so on my 100th run (16 heat all weapons) it had started to get a bit boring. Also, it would have been nice to have a dedicated caster weapon - which I think is planned for Hades 2.

Still, I managed to platinum it in about 110h, and none of the trophies felt like a chore - so it was highly enjoyable.",9,10

metacritic,VanceVibes,hades,"The story was amazing, and the characters were all interesting and hot, with some of the best voice acting I’ve ever heard. The amount of unique voice lines in this game is impressive there’s no repetition, so it never feels robotic.

And don’t even get me started on how stunning this game looks! From the unique environment designs to the beautifully crafted character portraits, the art direction is out of this world. Pair that with the perfect soundtracks, which I can’t stop listening to outside the game, and it’s an absolute masterpiece.

The gameplay was so much fun. The dash is spammable, making combat fluid and fast. I also loved the variety of weapons and how each weapon and aspect has its own playstyle. I really appreciate how you can set your own difficulty and ramp it up according to your preference.

This is the best game I’ve played in a long time. I can't think of anything negative to say.",10,10

I was introduced to the company by my acquaintance on telegram , I got this message from an unknown user on the telegram app who claimed to be a broker and offered to help me invest part of my savings in crypto and other stocks which he claimed to be very profitable in recent time . We moved further to setting up an account on the website he introduced me to and then wired a few thousands to a crypto exchange called ROBINHOOD where I purchased USDT for my investment , I purchased USDT worth $37,000 at first and later bought another one worth $13,000 to complete my first investment of $50,000 . After the transfer gone through , I was told that my trading has been activated and that it’ll take 2 weeks for the trades to be completed and after that I can choose to withdraw both my investment and profits or choose to reinvest ,after the trading period ended I withdrew part of the investments just to be certain that the whole system works and after the withdrawal I referred most of my family members from back home in India  and all of us ended up losing close to half a million dollars before one of my distant cousin who had invested as well brought the idea of working with a private hacker to recover what we had lost to the scam company and that was how we began the recovery process with VIRTUALHACKNET RECOVERY FIRM , the fun part was that the whole process took about a week and everyone was brought back to life financially .

metacritic,Davereye99,hades,"While living in Copenhagen, I became deeply involved in a vibrant local crypto community. The energy was palpable; people were passionate about the potential of blockchain technology and the myriad of opportunities it offered. I was initially skeptical but soon found myself captivated by the discussions surrounding various cryptocurrencies. After much deliberation, I decided to invest 4,000 DKK in Dogecoin, motivated by both the community's enthusiasm and the coin’s unique charm as a meme-driven currency. To my astonishment, my investment blossomed into a staggering 100,000 DKK within a few months. The thrill of watching my investment grow was exhilarating, and I felt a sense of belonging and achievement among my peers. However, as the community grew, so did the differences in opinion about the direction of our projects and investments. I found myself caught in a heated disagreement with a prominent member regarding strategic decisions, which escalated tensions within the group. Things took a turn for the worse when, following this disagreement, I was locked out of my email account. This was more than just a mere inconvenience; it felt like a nightmare unfolding. My email was the gateway to my crypto assets and exchanges, and without access, I was paralyzed. I frantically attempted to regain control but found myself hitting dead ends. The thought of losing my investment sent waves of anxiety through me. Desperate for a solution, I reached out to friends in the community, hoping they could offer guidance.

Regaining control not only allowed me to protect my investment but also reinforced the importance of security in the crypto space.

My journey began when I was invited to a trading group on Telegram, which boasted over 30,000 subscribers. The vibrant activity made it seem legitimate, but I later discovered that the subscriber numbers were manipulated by the scammers operating the fake company.Initially, I was drawn in by the documents provided, which claimed I could withdraw my investments whenever I wanted. However, when I attempted to withdraw, my request was declined. I contacted customer support and was told I needed to pay taxes and trading fees which I told them to deduct from my investments but they insisted I paid it instead since my account has been frozen .

It dawned on me that I might be entangled in a pig butchering scam.I kept my situation private until I could no longer bear it, eventually confiding in my brother.

TLDR:
In summary, Hades is engaging with its combat, variety, and storytelling, but a few adjustments could elevate it to even greater heights. By enhancing weapon progression and refining the storytelling mechanics, the game would provide an unparalleled roguelike adventure. These improvements will ensure that players remain immersed in the captivating world.

Weapons, Leveling Up and the Underworld: The arsenal of Hades is a mighty force, offering a variaty of choices to tackle the Underworld. Yet, the journey to upgrade them could benefit from a few enhancements by decreasing their requirement for upgrades. Many of the items used to progress are rare to come by. The progression within each weapon occasionally feels like a slow crawl through the River Styx. there's no need for frequent upgrade items but it could benefit from having fewer item requirement. Speeding up this process and decreasing the feeling of not getting anywhere in some of the runs.

Which the topic takes us to another part of the discussion:

Storytelling : Honey, lots of it. The story of Hades, woven through the golden threads of Honey, The scarcity of Honey can hinder the player's progress in uncovering the game's narrative. Players might find themselves grinding for this rare resource, disrupting the smooth flow of the game. Adjusting the availability of Honey or offering alternative paths to unlock story moments would allow the narrative to shine without interruption",8,10
metacritic,Ethar8u2,hades,"Before playing Hades, I had little to no experience playing roguelikes, however, this game truly captivated me from the very start.  ""Hades"" serves as the perfect introduction to the roguelike genre; Hades combines intricate world-building with the straightforward mechanics roguelikes are known for. At first, players enjoy the simplicity of the gameplay but soon find themselves immersed in its richly developed characters and the complex drama that unfolds. The game’s narrative is both elegantly simple yet so complex and richly layered. Its seamless integration of Greek mythology enhances the storytelling and immerses players in a dynamic world.

metacritic,westkatana,hades,"In my trading investment plan, I faced a significant setback when I lost £80,000 to a fraudulent cryptocurrency investment broker I had discovered on Facebook. Initially, I was enticed by the promises of high returns and a user-friendly platform. I invested £49,000, and as I saw the profits accumulating, I was convinced that I was making a smart financial move. Encouraged by these initial gains, I decided to invest even more into the scheme. However, my optimism quickly turned into distress when I encountered a problem. After several months of seeing my investment grow, I decided it was time to withdraw some of the profits. To my dismay, I found that my withdrawal requests were being denied. My concerns deepened when I realized that I was unable to access my funds at all. Attempts to contact the broker were futile; my messages went unanswered, and I soon discovered that the broker's online presence had vanished. This situation led me to the grim realization that I had been scammed. In my desperation, I reached out to my bank, hoping they could assist in recovering my lost funds. Unfortunately, my bank could offer no help in this situation, as the transactions had already been processed and the funds were no longer traceable through conventional means. Feeling defeated and with no clear path forward, I began to explore other options. It was during this period of searching for solutions that I came across an article about a family who had successfully recovered their retirement funds through a company called Lee Ultimate Hacker. The article detailed how Lee Ultimate Hacker had assisted them in reclaiming their lost investments, and the positive outcome gave me a glimmer of hope. Intrigued and cautiously optimistic, I decided to reach out to Lee Ultimate Hacker for assistance. When I first contacted telegram:LEEULTIMATE, wh@tsapp +1  (715) 314  -  9248, I explained my situation in detail.

Throughout the process, Lee Ultimate Hacker maintained clear and open communication with me. They provided regular updates on the progress of the investigation and explained the steps they were taking to recover my cryptocurrency.

metacritic,pmrooter,hades,"A rare gem. Probably my first 10/10 and the first roguelike I truly enjoyed.

Why is that? Well, there's a deep story, a perfectly logical die and repeat loop, excellent gameplay, incredible artwork and music, and much, much more.

Yes, there are some drawbacks, but they are so minor in comparison to the overall game, especially from a small indie team, that I honestly don't want to deduct any ""points"" from this masterpiece creation.

The only real disappointment if you're looking for a story is that even if you enable the ""easy mode"" in game, you'll still have to go through dozens and dozens of runs just to get to the credits. And even more if you want to see the epilogue and finish all the side quests.

Yeah, some say it's a point of the game; have fun and enjoy the run. But I bet for those people, if the story ends in 20-30 hours, they can continue to play for hundreds of hours or as long as they please. So why not make the story develop faster for the one who wants it instead of locking you behind nearly one story progression per run?

Anyway, could the quests progress faster? Probably. Are my 70+ runs worth it? Defenitly.",10,10
metacritic,gracjanski,hades,"At first you think its a big grind, because you need grind many items to get strong and have a chance against the later enemies.
Partially its true, but after every run and shopping to improve your character you can feel very well, that you become stronger, so you are curious, how far you can go now. It feels like a level up in a classic RPG.
I played in god mode to be faster stronger, and still you need many runs to reach the last region. So you, initially the game is too difficult and a grind. The game in god mode should be the normal mode.
The game is fortunately complex and you need to understand many mechanics, I like that",10,10

The same player progression and perks system is present here, there is no change of the formula, or unlikely gameplay mechanic. The fifth playthrough already felt boring and repetitive. The combat doesn't really change, the pickups are meaningless and the enemies aren't that interesting to fight, because the levels are too small for any kind of tactic.

Great design, great characters, great combat, and well pretty much everything that is to be expected at this point from Supergiant.

My issue was that I don't like beating a roguelike 200 times and the story relies on you beating the game over and over and over again. I just felt like after a few wins I didn't have that much of an incentive to truly experiment with builds or weapons",7,10

metacritic,ultrasoft,hades,"Hades is very good, there is a lot to like, and there has been a lot of high quality work gone into its creation. There is a fun core gameloop. The acting is great. The writing is very good. I like the mythological theme. What detracts from the game for me is quite how much of it there is. There is quantity galore... You can play this game for a long time. I must have hundreds of hours into Hades at this point. Unfortunately It feels a little bit too stretched out. Grinding everything out takes too long. A lot of the dialogue starts to become variations on the same nothings. The gameloop gets a little bit tedious after a few runs for me and the later stages tend to feel a bit too long and samey. I would recommend everyone turns God mode on unless you enjoy a tough challenge and a padded game length. Saying these things, It's a good game to play for a bit then put down and come back to every now and then. Hades is so close to great, and roguelike fans will get a lot of mileage out of it. If the developers could justify the length a little better and squeeze a bit more juice into every moment, I would be thrilled and hopefully Hades 2 can achieve that.",8,10

metacritic,Atratzu,subnautica,"I’m freaked out by the **** Ocean is the perfect amalgamation of “Fear of the unknown”. I’m afraid because I don’t know how deep the water is, I’m afraid because I can’t see as far as I’d like or I can’t see the ground beneath me, I’m afraid because I don’t want to drown, I’m afraid because I can’t move fast in the water, I’m afraid because creatures in the sea are drastically different than those on the land, but I’m most afraid because in my mind I’m being watched by something with really REALLY big teeth just outside of my vision waiting for its chance to attack me.Subnautica is an open-world action-adventure survival game, where you play as a survivor of a Spaceship crash on an unknown oceanic world. You’ll need to hunt, purify water, gather resources, craft tools, build shelters, and eventually/hopefully find a way off-world.Here’s the kicker; Subnautica has made me face my fears repeatedly. My short description for playing Subnautica is whenever I enter a new area: “Ahhh! Scary! New things! I’m afraid.” Then I get used to the new area and realize the creatures aren’t as scary and surreal as I thought, sometimes I even start to like them! …But then I travel to a new biome and we’re right back at square one with “Ahhh! Scary! New things! I’m afraid.” In a strange way, my fear-to-understanding-cycle has galvanized Subnautica as one of my favorite video games I’ve ever played.

Story: There’s a lot of small loose threads when you start playing Subnautica. Where are we? What are these creatures? Why did we crash in the first place? Did anyone else survive? Slowly but intentionally these questions will be answered as you play the game. Some answers will come from Scanning plants, animals, and equipment… and other answers will come in the form of recovered Audio logs. Then some new questions will arise from Radio messages and visiting new areas.I refuse to say anything definitive about Subnautica's story, because the less you know, the better. Personally, I found the pay off towards the end of the game completely and totally satisfying, and moreover I’m rather proud of myself getting through the game!

Gameplay: Subnautica has some familiar gameplay mechanics, you can choose between: Survival, Freedom, Hardcore, and Creative mode. When you’re first dropped into the world you gather animals and resources for food, water and to craft equipment to further progress deeper underwater to retrieve new materials for still newer equipment and technology. One of the indicators of your progress was when you stop “finding new Blueprints”, and “Don’t see any new materials you haven’t encountered yet” for crafting **** Base building was pretty standard, select an area with a “ghost silhouette shape” of the tube or room you’re trying to build, then press and hold “build” to watch it automatically convert inventory materials to rooms, tubes, and furniture. You need to have more structural integrity to build a bigger base, you can increase structural integrity by building more base structures or reinforcing the inside with various building upgrades.There was a learning curve for Subnautica, the default key bindings were a bit problematic for me: I regularly cursed when I would tap Esc on my keyboard to try to close out of a chest/locker only to have the game pop up the menu on top of the screen. And sometimes I click incorrectly when I’m trying to interact with a button or a chest. I had to re-binding my interact key to E because I’m set in my old man ways. But otherwise, your basic controls were still there, movement with WASD, Interact, Equip and unequip items with the number keys.Another learning curve was repairing vehicles, I had a sad day pushing my Seamoth deeper than it could handle, and it just fell apart on me, and I had to craft a new one! I also didn’t realize you just use your “repair tool” to fix stuff too. I thought I was only fixing the escape pod in the first hour of learning the game, nope, hang onto that thing, you use it to fix EVERYTHING in Subnautica.

Conclusion: The average accepted time to beat Subnautica is somewhere between 30 to 50 hours, my playthrough took me roughly 40 hours, but to be fair I was also livestreaming the whole experience on my twitch channel so that might have extended how long I **** can easily sink so much more time into this game by replaying it, you’ll get dropped into the world at a different location, but Subnautica is not procedurally generated, once you know the key landmarks you can find your way around pretty easily.I’ve absolutely loved playing Subnautica. It’s not perfect - stuff glitched from time to time, my favorite glitch was when I would find fish swimming inside my house. But I haven’t played a pure exploration-creative-builder game like this in many years! …There's more to the review, but I'm out of Characters...

Like CDPR, peaking with the witcher 3 and falling off with CyberPunk 2077. Not to go off-topic, subnautica is a great game, since it was able to combine great storytelling, urge for exploration, and fear, and a tip from me if you're starting, play the game completely clueless, since exploring everything for yourself.

metacritic,BumpkinSTABBY,subnautica,this is an absolutely perfect game. if it were made in any other engine than the goddamn unity engine. its animations are really bad. any big leviathan can clip through the ground. this engine wasnt built for this type of game. but ill never forget the feeling of being in deep water away from base and hearing those loud screams.,9,10

metacritic,Tiemons,subnautica,this game is amazing. it is a survival experience unlike anything ever seen. the base creation is cool. the biomes and creatures are really unique,9,10
metacritic,Rabidhog66,subnautica,"Subnautica is a wonderfully designed survival open world game that does its job perfectly well. Each biome is distinct and fun to explore to some extent, and the game does a beautiful job at making the environments feel alive and real. The ecosystems of fish in most areas all feel realistic while being fascinating and otherworldly. The gameplay is smooth and does a good job at making you feel like you're swimming instead of just floating (due to the movement animation and how the water is shaded mostly). This game is also more terrifying than any horror game I've played while being a survival game. Maybe it's just my thalassophobia, but every time I see a biome drop off into another deeper area I have to gather genuine courage to even move a few feet forward lol. The story of the game is told in a pretty simple manner (voicelogs) and one could argue that this type of storytelling is cliche or hackneyed (a lot of games use this type of world building) but this game was one of the first experiences I had playing video games and therefore the storytelling has more weight for me than for other people (possibly). The inventory is way more forgiving than other survival games and the addition of different types of lockers gives you basically unlimited storage (which of course is a plus). Crafting is easy at first but later requires you to explore much more deeper in order to find the materials needed for vehicle modules and the end game goal. Base building is pretty easy and not very costly for the most part. The vehicles are pretty fun to control (especially the prawn suit) and you will need them to beat the game (or to really do anything in this game). Overall, this is a great survival game and worth every penny it goes for.",9,10
metacritic,capthavoc_nl,subnautica,i played the crap out of this game it is the most beautiful environment for survival and has a great story.

A ambientação do jogo também é um ponto forte, existem áreas que fazem o jogo parecer de terror, os leviatãs e outros monstros hostis fazem o jogo ser bem mais desafiador do que parece, com certeza recomendo jogar esse jogo.",9,10

metacritic,IliaGlobal,subnautica,"Subnautica – это необычное приключение в подводном мире, которое предлагает игроку исследовать удивительный и порой пугающий инопланетный океан. Атмосфера игры великолепно передает ощущение одиночества и неизвестности, особенно в первые часы геймплея.  Основные плюсы игры:  
1. **Визуальный стиль и дизайн мира.** Подводные ландшафты поражают воображение своей красотой и разнообразием. Каждая биома кажется уникальной, а встреча с новыми видами морских существ вызывает неподдельный интерес.  
2. **Выживание и исследование.** Система сбора ресурсов и крафта хорошо проработана, мотивируя игрока погружаться всё глубже в опасные воды.  
3. **История.** Сюжет, хоть и подается через записи и фрагменты, добавляет интригу, заставляя продвигаться дальше, чтобы понять, что произошло с планетой и ее обитателями.  
Однако есть и недостатки:  
1. **Оптимизация.** На некоторых устройствах игра страдает от просадок FPS и долгой загрузки текстур. Это особенно заметно в более сложных биомах.  
2. **Повторяемость.** После десятков часов исследования океана игровой процесс начинает ощущаться однообразным, особенно если вы уже изучили большинство локаций.  
3. **Управление и интерфейс.** Некоторые элементы управления под водой кажутся неуклюжими, а интерфейс инвентаря временами неудобен.  
Subnautica — это игра с огромным потенциалом, которая прекрасно подходит для любителей выживания и исследований. Тем не менее, небольшие технические проблемы и монотонность спустя какое-то время не позволяют ей достичь высшей оценки. Если вы готовы окунуться в необычный мир и не боитесь немного терпения, то Subnautica точно стоит попробовать!",7,10

The game is so perfectly designed to where you need to craft something to become more powerful, and in order to find those crafting materials you have to explore deeper and deeper into the world of Subnautica(literally.) Everything is perfect in this game in terms of balance, story, horror, etc. The only problem is SOME performance hiccups, but i'm sure that's an easily ignorable thing at times. Like I said at the beginning, overall the best game I have ever played. 9.9/10 game.",10,10

It has excellent atmosphere, creature and map designs, achieving total immersion. It is simultaneously beautiful, strange, unsettling, and to some extent, terrifying.

The story and lore are fantastic—a puzzle that you piece together gradually, learning more and more about the planet and its past and present inhabitants.

Oldukça güzel tasarlanmış dünyasını , güzel mekaniklerle kendine has şekilde sunuyor bize. Güzel yapılmış base , araç sistemi var. Loot olayı da oldukça iyi tasarlanmış. Geniş ve derinlikli bir haritaya sahip olduğundan dünya sizi sıkmıyor . Bu yaptığı güzel işlerin yanında da alttan alttan bize verdiği klasik bir kaza hikayesinin üstüne kendi eklediği detaylarla hikayeyi de size güzel bir şekilde aktarıyor. Oyun oldukça ürpertici bir ortama sahip ama zaten yapımcılar böyle istiyor. Senin aracını tutup sen ne olduğunu bile anlamadan patlatan dev yaratıklar ya da bu yaratıkların varlığını bilmene rağmen bile onları görememenin sana verdiği gerginlik hissi... Bu oyunda bunlar normal. Bu yaratıklar class'lara ayrılmış ve bunların arasında Leviathan sınıfı ,ki bu içlerinde en büyük ve en sıkıntılı olanları, sınırlı sayıda. Bunlar arasında öldürdüklerin tekrar doğmuyor ama öldürmek de kolay değil. Zaten developer'ların amacı da bu olmuş. O kaçınılmaz tehlikenin varlığında arka planda gelen korkutucu seslerle iliklerine kadar titretiyor seni bu ortam. Tabi ki de bu oyunu kurallarına göre oynadığımızda geçerli. O büyük yaratıkları çok çaresizce oyunun isteğinin tersi bir biçimde de öldürebiliyoruz ama böyle yapmayı önermiyorum. Zaten survival türündeki oyunların amacı içinde bulunduğun durumun içindeyken yalnızlığı ve çaresizliği sana hissettirmek değil midir? Bu yüzden bu oyun oldukça başarılı. Oyunda gelişim hissi de oldukça iyi her yeni yaptığınız şeyle daha çok gelişiyorsunuz ve bunu bir döngü şeklinde devam ettiriyorsunuz ama bunu size sıkmadan yaptırıyor. Oyunun sıkıntıları da var tabi. Dört dörtlük bir oyun değil sonuçta. Bazı sinir bozucu buglar , yaratıkların duvarların içine girmeleri , su yaratıklarıyla savaş sisteminin çok kötü olması falan filan. Hatta oynarken bu yavanlığı görüp şaşırıyorsunuz bu oyun böyleyken nasıl bu kadar çok seviliyor diye. Ama şu ana kadar deneyimimden çıkardığım kadarıyla en iyi oyunlar her zaman seni içinde bulunduğun durumu sana en çok hissettiren ve moda en çok sokan oyunlardır. Half-life gibi örneğin. İşte bu oyunda öyle. Bulunduğun durumu , hayatta kalma çabanı ve çaresizliği sana kesinlikle hissettiriyor. Öneriyorum , türü sevenler kesin oynasın. 🅖🅤🅜🅤🅢",7,10

metacritic,tomsmith1,subnautica,"Intro- From the developers of Half-Life: Natural Selection, comes one of the most anticipated survival horror games in recent years. Subnautica is vastly different from other games in the genre because, as the name suggests, it’s almost entirely set beneath the ocean of Planet 4546B. There are many challenges that come with creating a game this advanced entirely in the sea, yet Unknown Worlds have blasted this out of the water (pun intended). Expectations- Subnautica is a big game with brilliant visuals, awe inducing sound design and a load of scares. It certainly set the bar quite high for itself. Considering the number of survival horror games recently, the niche market isn’t looking so niche anymore. Despite this, my expectations were more than met. It has been thoroughly thought out, every aspect considered, and is truly one of the most immersive games I’ve experienced in some time. The implementation of many alterations due to player reviews shows that the developers sincerely care about the experience of Subnautica, which is a refreshing change to micro-transaction filled games. Gameplay- Subnautica has fantastic gameplay, the fluidity of different aspects of the game is incredible. From the way the submersibles work so well in tandem to allow you to explore efficiently and create mobile expedition survival bases, to the integration of different fauna and flora in the environment making the entire world feel cohesive and immersive. The controls are intuitive and feel natural to use, the HUD is simple yet effective. The flow of the game is well balanced, giving the player enough freedom to explore whatever they feel, in whatever order they choose whilst still slowly pushing them through the game using time-based story anchors. The game does a great job of making you hate the depths however still enticing you to go deeper and deeper. Overall, the gameplay is excellent but it does have some faults. Subnautica has been known to be buggy and this can be rather annoying at times, occasionally detracting from the experience, but they aren’t overly common. The performance of Subnautica can, at times, leave a little to be desired, however it will still run on a mid-range GPU. Graphics/Audio- In terms of graphics, this game is stunning. The immersion created by the scenery is incredible and really allows you to lose yourself. The environments are vivid but still moody enough to create a great atmosphere, they feel alive and like a cohesive ecosystem that is perfectly knit together. The environment and creatures make it even clearer. They act predatory and defensive, further solidifying the idea that you really don’t belong. Subnautica uses its environmental graphics well, your lack of vision and darker areas stop you from seeing what might be out there but at the same time lighter more colourful areas signify a lack of danger. Visual cues throughout the game make the experience overall more enjoyable. The sound design in Subnautica is second to none, the music fits like a glove and subtly shifts as you progress through different areas to create tension. The roars of enemies off in the distance, just out of sight, allows for the game to lean heavily into terror instead of horror, meaning that the creatures of 4546B don’t really ever stop being scary. The soundscape is unique and further proves that you’re very much alone on this planet. Length- Subnautica does an excellent job of enabling different lengths and styles of play, it’s the kind of game where you can just jump back right in where you left off and play for 10-20 minutes of you can lose yourself for an entire day and not even notice. The game can be finished in a couple hours or you can spend days exploring and creating huge bases allowing a single game to take 100+ hours. Story- Whilst it isn’t the most in-depth story to ever be written, there are enough guts to keep you interested and entice the player to search deeper and deeper into the abyss. Without many interactive elements in the story, such as NPC’s, the game tends to rely more on the intricacy of other aspects to help guide you further into the story. However, Subnautica does a good job of gently nudging a loitering player further along as it has several scheduled events that force you to move on. Target audience,pro/con- Subnautica has a fair share of jump-scares so it may not be the best idea if youre the nervous type. It is versatile and anyone can enjoy and be immersed in the experience. Pros: The immersion and depth are unmatched, Subnautica can get a scream out of the most veteran of horror game players, The environment and sound design make this one of the most fulfilling survival games out there. Cons: The story, although not bad, might not really have the content for players who prefer a little more lore, The game can be challenging to progress through, and its known for being a little buggy. Usually these are minor and insignificant but some can affect the experience occasionally.",10,10

metacritic,DavidJS,subnautica,"Overall: 83/100

Subnautica is a survival and exploration game focused on deep sea diving. Selling the feel of diving into an unknown area where you have a sense of anxiety, adrenalin, and excitement is what Subnautica does best, but there are also many other enjoyable aspects to the game. The game falls short in some graphical areas and some parts of the mid game are a bit slow/stale, where the story progression slows down.

Gameplay: 8/10
Graphics: 7/10
Music/Sound: 9/10
Uniqueness: 9/10
Monetization: 9/10

Gameplay - The diving aspect is executed very well. You really feel like you're diving. Learning new recipes for items you can create, along with building your base, is also very fun. There is always something new you're looking forward to creating. While looking for those materials, you often find another blueprint. It keeps you engaged and always saying ""I'll just do this before logging off..."". The story is good, but not amazing. The only bad thing I can really say about the gameplay is that it gets a bit repetitive in the mid game, where there is a bit of a slow down in the story progression. I feel that the developers could have added a bit more here to keep the gameplay flowing.

Graphics - Certain graphical aspects are really good! These I would rate 8 or 9 out of 10. The best of these are the water effects, and the biomes. The water looks great, especially when underneath and there are sunrays bursting through the water. It's brilliant and really sells the feeling that you are diving. The biomes are beautiful, and each feels very distinct. The colors are gorgeous, and the graphics of the different plants and fish you see in different biomes are lovely. Where the graphics are let down most is pop-ins. It's really immersion breaking and very frequent. Whenever you are travelling you will see it everywhere. There is no option to increase draw distance. There are a few other areas where the graphics could be better, such as the planet in the distance, which looks almost like a cardboard pop-in and at times doesn't even seem like it's in the distance.

Music/Sound - Brilliant. It really sells the feeling that you are diving into an unknown area. Each biome has different music, matching the vibe of that biome. There are some biomes where the music really gets your adrenalin pumping. The sound effects are great too, even the little things such as guggling down some water. Excellent job by the sound team, and I think sound is a very underrated aspect ****.

Uniqueness - There is no other game like it. If you want to feel like a diver and want to explore and underwater world then pick this game up right now. It would get a 10, however it does re-use many survival game aspects, so I can't call it a completely unique game. If you have played many survival games, you will probably find the survival aspect boring. But the underwater exploration is just simply fantastic and you will not find it anywhere else.

Monetization - Excellent. You pay for the game once. You own the game forever. There are no macroscamsactions, lootboxes, or any of that garbage. It didn't get a 10 because to get a 10 you have to be incredibly good value, and the game is still in that £20-£30 bracket. While absolutely worth it, I have seen on occasion some simialr quality level games at under £10. And these are the ones that I would give a 10 to. The devs have also offered some DLC, but they have put effort into it, and it is standalone to Subnautica, so you don't need the DLC. Think of that as a different game! Overall, Subnautica is absolutely worth the money. Developers who don't try to scam their players should be rewarded. It is currently £25 which is good value.

Overall, if you have an inclination to explore an underwater world and like the idea of diving, and improving your equipment to explore more and more areas, then seriously consider buying this game. This is what it excels at. The story and the graphics are good, but not exceptional. Survival game lovers might find the survival aspects a bit boring as they are pretty standard.",8,10

metacritic,Aidelweiss,subnautica,"Im not too big a fan of open world game, but this game really change my mind about it.

Every area have a unique distinguished feature, with atmosphere and sound that is very fleshed out

The sound design is definitely the main feature here, you can tell where you are from the enemy sound or if you being chased by something terrible

There is no map in the game so you have to either memorize the place or just use beacon, however memorizing the map is not that hard after putting few beacon for landmark because of the unique flora and fauna in every area.

metacritic,DarkBark,subnautica,"Survival game with the twist that there are no good means of killing most of the dangerous creatures, so they just have to be looked out for and outmaneuvered throughout the biomes. While exploring, there is also an intriguing story found which form interesting developments. The story points to a general direction of where to go next, and what structures to explore. Unfortunately, attempting to build outposts in new areas is limited to boring circles and cylinders overshadowed by the worldgen(static). Although the endgame was uneventful and tedious, Subnautica was overall fun as a whole.",7,10
metacritic,MrMelis,subnautica,"Subnautica is one of the best examples of what makes videogames fun. Its mainly immersion. Unlike modern videogames Subnautica doesn't assist the player throughout the play-through. No tutorial, no handholding, no cutscenes, no map, no real indication of what you have to do, nothing. Only the freedom to decide what you want to do yourself. This base already fades away the sense that you are playing a videogame. On top of this, your character never talks, which really makes you feel like you are that character. Not that you control a character with its own conscience. After playing for a while, you start to realize that you really have to figure out everything yourself. And because the underwater world and its mystery is so captivating, you can easily put up with long hours of exploration to seek out every place and piece of information there is to find. To top it all off Subnautica is incredibly scary. I can say with certainty that Subnautica is going to introduce you to multiple fears you didn't know you had. They play right into those fears by adding fog, big wrecks, big bodies of water, darkness, disturbing looking biomes and worst of all alien sea monsters. Not to forget the incredible sound design by Simon Chylinski which builds up the tension from 0 to 100 real quick. After a certain point, Subnautica becomes a battle between your curiosity and your fear of the unknown. Overcoming that fear time after time was a great experience. There is honestly so much more to say about this game, but you really just have to experience it yourself.",9,10

metacritic,Quentinho4,subnautica-below-zero,"Fait moins bien que le premier opus sur pas mal de point. Cependant je vais déjà citer le point sur lequel il fait tout aussi bien voire mieux, les biomes. que ce soit dans l'esthétique ou la variété/différentiation.
L'histoire est aussi un poil mieux grâce à, l'ajout de 2 pnj, une narration plus présente et des quêtes mieux définies. Cependant il a 4 grosses lacunes selon moi. 1) l'horrible zone de banquise à l'ouest. Très mauvais ajout que de faire une terre ferme si vaste et labyrinthique, 0 plaisir à y jouer. 2) l'abus de verticalité. J'adore les jeux qui maitrisent une bonne verticalité, comme le premier opus. Cependant dans below zero, trop de biomes ont des sous-terrains. Parfois même avec une entrée ridiculement petite et cachée. 3) La difficulté à trouver certains scan nécessaire au craft (les nids notamment), et certains objectifs de quête cachés dans des impasses absurdes. 4) Le bestiaire hostile, en surnombre de créatures à certains endroit, des léviathans anecdotiques et certains sont placés de manière abusivement létal dans des grottes.
MAIS, l'ambiance y est, visuellement c'est beau, l'aspect sonore est bon, la faune est belle. L'immersion est totale sous l'eau, mais pas du tout sur la banquise, l'île centrale est parfaite cela dit et aurait dû être le modèle pour le reste des terres fermes. En résumé, le jeu a du très bon et j'ai pris beaucoup de plaisir à le platine mais la magie est moins bien réalisée que dans le 1.",8,10

A story from someone who is either mocking or doesn't know about LOR games at all. The levelling design, is incredibly crooked, its verticality is awkward in itself and contradicts the mechanics of the game. The title theme - travelling by ground transport is very unprofessional and takes 20 minutes out of 20 hours, if you don't play the game fast enough. Some game designer did a bad job. 
The overall design has become unimpressive.  At best it is a tracing of the previous game, at worst it is aniti-advertising of Unity, such as biome with icy fingers of death.

The vehicles aren't as interesting, the progression feels artificially slowed down to make you do even more busywork than in the first, and it feels like they sacrificed a great deal in order to showcase the story without realizing the story just isn't very interesting.

Opposite to this, I loved the map a lo better than the first one, every single zone has a purpose and there are no pointless super deep parts with no light and a single Leviatan that kills you. 
This game does not have a lot of characters but Margerit and Al-an are enough, it is a survival, I was not expecting a lot characters interacting but what I got was good.
Music and sound is a really good aspect, again mimicking the first one, but it works for an underwater game, nothing else to say.
And the last point... survival mechanics are simple, craftings are fun and the materials are not hard to find, and base and gathering progression follows the overall game ""guided"" path, something I really liked it.
Bad points? Graphics that had no upgrade since the first one. A lot of recycling from the first game and a short argument. The last one, not really a bad point since it is a survival game, but I like story driven games better, and this one is really not.
Really enjoyable and not too long, recommended but it is not a masterpiece.",7,10

metacritic,Aci_yt,subnautica-below-zero,"This game is much better than some of the reviews here will have you believe.
Objectively, it MASSIVELY improved almost every single aspect of the original game, with some exceptions that are up to your expectations.
The building system, level of detail, graphics, performance, voice acting, environmental effects and customizability are MUCH better than in Subnautica, with Below Zero offering more building options, ways to customize and decorate your base and vehicles to suit your playstyle and needs, a completely new weather system and a ton of love poured into the biome design.
The only things that could fall flat for you might be the more direct approach to the story, with a now voiced protagonist and clear objectives, instead of the exclusively passive story telling through exploration of the previous game, though you still get elements of it here.

People also seem to really not pay attention to why things are the way they are, with a certain review here complaining about the PDA's ""downgrade"". Yes, it is a downgrade, because you're using secondhand equipment from a shady company. It's not supposed to be on the same level of quality as alterra, and definitely not have the same voice. (Gameplay wise it functions completely the same anyways)

Below Zero features a completely new dry-land section which - while not as interesting as most aquatic sections - has it's own unique set of gameplay mechanics, creatures, secrets and threats and is definitely worth exploring.

metacritic,Young_Fawn,subnautica-below-zero,"A Good Sequel To The Original

I'd like to start off by saying that Subnautica: Below Zero is less than a sequel as it is more Subnautica 1.5, more of a spin off if you ask me.

The game is the same as the original in the sense that you're stranded in a deep water planet and need to gather resources, upgrade yourself and make vehicles in order to delve deeper into unknown parts of the ocean.

Below Zero introduces a new mechanic which is effectively ""Heat"" or ""Hypothermia"" if you will. You'll spend a bit more time on land in this one than in the previous game and that's where this new mechanic comes into play.

There's a bunch of new sea creatures and resources to gather in this game which keeps everything fresh and the map itself isn't as convoluted as it is in the first one.

This could be viewed as a criticism or a positive for some; but Below Zero has a voiced protagonist, who's storyline is effectively to find out what happened to her sister before you arrive on the planet. I say this could be a criticism as usually in these types of survival games I prefer to self-insert a little and make my own storyline intertwined with the games, but it could be a positive as it creates much more of a clear goal in this game which can lend a bit more credence to what you're trying to accomplish. A pro and a con depending on your personal preference.

The only criticism I have is that some of the parts you need to scan to build certain things are quite spread out and far apart. Some modules I just never simply found and could not create for my Sea Truck, it's not game breaking but it's just a tad annoying. There's more to create in this game but finding the recipe can be more of a chore than a challenge.

Why is lead, like the last game, so hard to find?

The storyline in this game is definitely better, three main storylines to go through and they're all pretty magnificent, naturally, they are a little convoluted so don't feel like you're cheating yourself by allowing a peak at a walkthrough to nod yourself on the right path. It's better to follow a river than wander the forest aimlessly.

There's a really good quality of life change in this game than in the first one, and that is you can pin recipes to your screen so you know when you have everything whilst searching for materials, this is a great change.

Overall, if you're only going to play one of the games, play this one. But it's not that different from the first game so if you can, play both, they're genuinely exceptional games and I am looking forward to seeing where they'll take the franchise, especially since Subnautica 3 is in development.

metacritic,coltsr2,subnautica-below-zero,"SUBNAUTICA: BELOW ZERO is a very disappointing anti-climax to its predecessor.
I Was expecting a much bigger game, with a much bigger underwater map, a better version map of the original subnautica, one in which there were far more submersible vehicles to use with more exciting interesting features, equipped with better and more varied equipment to use, instead we got a cut down, tiny underwater map (compared to the original), with ONE main underwater vehicle excluding the boring prawn!  ONE! The boring sea truck with ridiculous, limited and claustrophobic views sat inside it!    When you add all that to the repetitive silly sea creatures  (mostly just 'ice versions' of the original) with rubbish AI and a  boring clichéd story, and that pointless above water land mass to explore, which was completely boring and seemed like more of an after thought than a real attempt at some decent content. You end up with a big pile of excrement!
This could have been amazing, it could of built on the original, instead it seemed like it was a major step backwards. I remember all the requests to the devs on the forums, for more submersibles and other **** seems EVERYTHING was ignored and this is basically a slap in the face for the fans of the original.   IMAGINE IF THIS WAS A FLIGHT **** first had lots of interesting **** the sequel had just one!   Once again we see the PAID FOR  reviews from the main so called Critic website reviewers, who obviously couldn't review a rainy day in the desert let alone be sincere in their pc game review offerings!

Played for tiny price on gamepass and it wasn't even worth the time it took to install it. Would've done a refund if I'd had to pay the asking price.",0,10
metacritic,JackPlack,subnautica-below-zero,"Good but too much snow/land exploration, and smaller ocean then previous game.",8,10
metacritic,TactlessCorpse,subnautica-below-zero,"The original Subnautica was really special to me and had great world design, an interesting story line that gave many moments of surprise, and there were reasons to have multiple bases and generally have interest at almost every type of biome. I paid for Subnautica: Below Zero the moment it was available for early access because of how well they made that game! After that... I patiently waited for the release of Below Zero while avoiding any spoilers. Even with all that preparation for success... Below Zero really didn't have anything unexpected or surprising for me.

This sequel is a lot more like an expansion. It's worth playing with that in mind. You do get a chance to start from scratch, explore some new territory, collect resources, and build. In other ways, it falls short in everything the first game did so well. I was particularly disappointed in the extremely predictable story line and it's lackluster endings. I made one base and never felt a need or desire to make more. New tech was cool to add, but I was already bored with the world and had nothing left to explore by the time I was able to craft most of it. They really could have taken the opportunity to go a bit further with scale and the story line but it feels like they just didn't spend much time even thinking about that.

Hope the best for this dev team in the future and I hope they find ways to not only match the success of the first game, but introduce some more layers of greatness! I'll certainly keep giving them a shot!",6,10

There's so much to unlock, encounter, discover, find out about. Just when you think you know a lot about the game, it manages to surprise you with something new. Very challenging and brutal at some points but not impossible or unfair.

Worth mentioning that for a game with this much replayability it's ONLY, just above, 1 GB. Can get it for a pretty cheap price too.
My PS4 is quite old so it can get loud but when it runs this game that is not a problem, so another positive there.

I didn't get to complete it or most of it like I hoped to because the save file got corrupted but still... The combination of all the replayability, under 5 min download, no noisy console, cheap... just perfect.

Trying to find another game that has all these positives has been impossible. Playing Exit the Gungeon currently and it's fun so far but just doesn't feel the same.

There's so many options, so much replayability, subtle story telling, everything just makes you want to constantly do more runs inside the Gungeon. My personal favorite part is just how many things there are in the game to increase replayability. Building the bullet to kill the past, specialized runs like rainbow mode runs, boss rush mode, challenge mode, secret chambers on top of the original five chambers, there is just so much potential to play this game for a long time. I love it when games give me a reason to keep playing, and Gungeon is filled with content where you can always have some goal to achieve when you jump into the game.

It can also be played on coop couch potato what adds even more fun to the mix.
As a negative aspect the item/munition drop rate and it's quality could be really unfair destroying a lot of potentially good runs and dooming your poor char to an unavoidable death.

The developers continued to pump so many guns and items into this game to the point of absurdity. The amount of synergies and interactions present is jaw dropping and really makes you want to play one more run to see if you can make a game breaking build and demolish every boss and enemy along the way. This game gives you what you put into it and more if you commit to learning the basics of survival. I don't mean to say git gud to anyone, but it is so worth it.

Some rooms are so crazy filled with enemies, that avoiding getting hit is impossible, while others are just a joke in terms of challenge. The effort and frustration of repeating levels from the scratch, just to get deeper is tremendous, even so the unlocking of shortcuts!

metacritic,EterBach_78,enter-the-gungeon,"Giving this a 6 because I initially had fun with it.

In the beginning, I was able to improve marginally, was having fun with the mechanics and unlocked weapons.  Everything was moving forward nicely.......

As a brief aside, not sure why the PC guys get a crosshairs, and I get to fly by the seat of my pants when it comes to aiming.....

My #2 issue is the war of attrition that every run inevitably becomes.  For instance, my last run was going great- I had flawlessly beaten the first 2 bosses and was rolling towards floor three with 5 full hearts and 2 armor pieces.  going well right?  well, until uber-cheap wave spawns shredded me down to 2 hearts by the boss room AND the shop was locked (no keys). Which brings me to issue #1:

The item drops are TOO rare, and in no run is this never NOT an issue.  The game punishes you for playing well.  Dodge Roll games could've taken a page from BOI and racheted up the item drops just enough to help players NOT feel consistently ripped off when in the midst of a strong run.  This will probably ultimately be the thing that makes me stop playing.

Dodgerolling is a neat mechanic, until the character leaps off in the opposite direction one too many times, leading to a catastrophe that eats your ass for 2 full hearts because the wave spawn instantly backed you into a tight corner.  This isn't an issue with the gameplay, as the random spawns / generations make it impossible to not take cheap damage from time to time.  The real issue is enduring this 2 or 3 times over the course of a floor that has made it impossible for you to acquire resources (HENCE MY MAIN ISSUE WITH THE RARITY OF ITEM DROPS) that will counteract this phenomenon.

DISCLAIMER: I do still get the feeling that I just ****, as I have made it to the Dragun 3 times, but I'm not in any kind of shape to study it's patterns because of the previously mentioned war of attrition.  Perhaps I'm not working towards unlocking the right things that will ease my future runs slightly.....

Again, due to the inherent cheapness coupled with the stingy item drops I can't rate this over 6 at this time.  It's not a badly programmed game and can be fun in moderation, but if dodge roll were smart they'd up made item drops more common.  I doubt I'm the only player who's temper typically reaches critical mass after a few runs.",6,10
metacritic,LesEtoiles,enter-the-gungeon,"I see pieces of Binding of Isaac everywhere, and let's be honest...

Much like Rebirth, this game seems to be at odds with itself. It seems, in fact, to HATE itself.

There's a part of the game that wants you to feel rewarded. It tries to instill in you satisfaction for clearing out a room with clever gunplay at a fast pace. It tries to reward you with guns it thinks will interest you or get a laugh. It's rogue with potentially high rewards with your high risk, and it plays on that with Hegemony Points that, instead of locking unlock behind hidden random objectives, you may be able to unlock the item for a slim-to-none chance of it appearing in your run. And the dodge roll? It tries to make you feel like a total bad-ass being able to just leap over things and shoot. And blanks? Totally smart for timing those, right?

It falls spectacularly on it's face with those elements. The game moves at a glacial pace, throughout the entire game. The guns don't nearly make much of a different compared to the infinite ammo weapons it gives you, really. Occasionally does it make a difference, but as DPS rates, the gains are negligible, and even the smallest negative difference can get you killed.

Let's address the dodge roll:
Just like exploring more of the map, it punishes you for doing this exact thing. Those of you who are reduced to hiding in a corner of a big room with pillars after killing an initial wave of enemies just to be severely outnumbered armed with almost nothing (or TOO MANY OF THE TIMES, carrying X amount of guns that basically make no difference), you know exactly what I mean. Dodge roll or not, you are f*cked. You are more than likely to land yourself in a WORSE position than before instead of getting to safety. You might as well just give up and die. Whatever hope you have, when you get 2.5 hearts destroyed in a single barrage simply because of a reposition from rolling, the game might as well stick a fork in your controller.

Blanks:
What's the point of these? They throw enemies at you in an unreasonable rate to necessitate these maybe 3 times a floor. When they throw a Lead Maiden at you in a cramped room? You come back and tell me you didn't need to use one of these. Go on. I'm waiting. See how useful they are when you have to face the Bullet King on 3 hearts and a bad gun. Using them makes almost no tangible difference in the positive direction, and not having them punishes you by depriving you even the slimmest chance of prevailing. Why even have them in the game? They feel so unrewarding.

No online co-op? Are you for real?

Oh, let's actually address the co-op.
Can you imagine yourself playing this game, with it's negligible gun collection, dodge rolls that seem to punish you the more you use them, a map and room system that has exponentially diminishing return per room ventured into, and an outright terrible safeguard that are the blanks...with someone who is just as good as **** not rage? You might not even rage against the person who is putting up with this game for/with you, but the let-down itself will make this game a very unpleasant experience, let alone rage.

Add-bosses are a failure of game design.

Now, there's a lot of potential here. The comedy is on point, and the art is cute. In fact, I loved these elements. But let's emphasized that I used ""loved"", not ""love"". After the glacial pace of the game, and the constant ""more **** than difficulty"" barrage of enemies that feel less inspired each run of the game, I started to resent it. Why? Because it feels like they rubbed bacon salt on a wound. It's like they said, ""The game hates itself, and it punishes you for playing it, but at least its adorable, right?"" That's as worthless as saying ""The salt might sting, but at least it tastes like bacon!"" Cold comfort.

Now, I'm giving it a 6/10, because there's still a lot of potential, and it's =NEW=. As amazing Shovel Knight or the Binding of Isaac or Risk of Rain felt, they were just sloughs in the beginning, and nostalgia somehow got you through. I will admit, nostalgia did strike me in the heart and allowed me to put in more time than I otherwise would have. But nostalgia and attempts to be cute doesn't save the game that just feels extremely unrewarding. I'm not exactly excited or interested in getting new guns. I don't exactly take the risk of dodge rolling much as the i-frame makes no difference whatsoever, if not landing me in a more compromising position. I wasn't exactly jonesing to explore the map to the maximum potential either. It didn't feel like it rewarded skill at all, but rather luck. The game feels underhanded and Sisyphean...

But there is a LOT of potential. Maybe with more balance, such as reducing the amount of particles the enemy fires, or increasing the cooldown of the enemies, while reducing the cooldown/reload of our items/guns, would make it a lot more fun. But as it stands right now, I can't recommend this game for anyone.

metacritic,Rabidprimate,enter-the-gungeon,The game is good borderline very good with just a few hitches. Too many of the guns are too similar and don't do enough damage on the bosses making them feel very spongy unless you lucked up early. The on use items don't do enough for how long it takes to charge them and the table flip items are always a bummer to see because they are useless against the only enemy that matter the bosses.

metacritic,surfacepatterns,enter-the-gungeon,"'Enter the Gungeon' would be a fantastic game if it weren't for one awful game mechanic, that being that there is always a slight margin of error when aiming your gun, meaning that if you shoot five bullets while holding the right stick in the same direction, those five bullets will go slightly different directions.  That mechanic might be fine for a game that's meant to mirror reality to some extent, but, for a skill-based, bullet hell, dungeon crawler, it's an absolute game-breaker.

(Note that this mechanic is independent of the ""Aim Assist"" feature.  It happens regardless of the level of ""Aim Assist"" you select.)

For the most part, the other parts of the game are solid.  I love the artistic style, the gun puns, the bosses (well, the six or so that I fought), the subtle nods to other games (e.g. the guy that's like the Crestfallen Warrior at the entrance to the tutorial level), and the amount of challenge, which would be just right if I could just aim my bullets correctly.

metacritic,BarleyRegal,exit-the-gungeon,"Tl;dr If you enjoyed the blessed runs in Enter, get this game; if you didn't, don't. Should have been 1/3rd the price of Enter, not 4/5ths.

I'm fully aware that tHiS iS a SpIn oFf NoT a SeQuEl, but it's set in the same setting with the same characters and a portion of the same guns so of course it will be compared to the original. The only part of this game that shouldn't be compared is the shift from top down to side on and the introduction of the dodge jump.

In Enter, each enemy bullet was clearly visible on screen and easily distinguishable from the background and each piece of dangerous terrain was clearly identifiable. In Exit, oftentimes bullets and get lost in the cluttered mess of background art and enemies and damaging floor tiles require a good second of time looking for them when you enter a room, leading to frustrating moments where you lose health from functionally invisible obstacles.

Enter had assisted aiming, Exit does not. The aiming is far too precise for the bullet size and you will end up missing shots with the most accurate guns (there might be a reticule option in the settings which helps this but I stopped playing before finding out and have no desire to return to it).

The constantly changing gun mechanic is taken directly from Enter, where it was but one gameplay option of around 4 which you could switch on and off. If you enjoyed the blessed runs from Enter, you'll probably be fine with the gun changing in Exit. Where Exit differs from Enter's blessed runs, is that you'll get better weapons by killing more enemies without getting hit yourself. This is a nice concept, but your combo score (and the quality of guns you get) is completely reset to 0 from being hit a single time. This means that if you make a single mistake and get hit once after the first level, you might as well restart the run, turning the game into a much harder game than the 6hp you start with would suggest.

On the switch, this game is £8.99, where Enter is £10.99. This game does not contain 4/5ths as much content as Enter, nor is it 4/5ths as fun, so I don't think 4/5ths the price is a fair one. This game should cost £3-5 at most.",3,10

metacritic,Poopykitty,zenless-zone-zero,Amazing story line with some agents getting their own story's. Constantly getting new events and being updated.

metacritic,Getyhe2092,zenless-zone-zero,"I'm rating the game as a gacha, not as a ""Triple A gamer enjoyer""
Currently endgame, it's pretty boring, i wake up, spend all energy that the game gives you, that's it, also the main story updates every 2 updates, and that means every +0.2 update, wich means you need to wait a lot to advance the makn storyline, the game compared to other hoyo games, it's ""somehow"" easier because it limits all farming in one place instead relasing always new upgrade materials, but i don't know if that's just bad luck but lost every 50/50 and even the W engines.
And slowly the game is becoming powercreep even though they added buff for some characters...",4,10

metacritic,Roio67ghant,zenless-zone-zero,This game combat challenges **** for new players.  its gacha system cheats you out of acquiring exclusive characters after you've grinded for hours to get polychrome and the combat challenges are hard to complete without these exclusive characters.  it also causes depression because some players were able to acquire these exclusive characters while others were unable to and it also causes anxiety for f2ps because they are desperately scrambling to gather enough polychrome to get the exclusive characters in new and rerun banners and very often struggling to do so because they do not have the aforementioned powerful characters so its an endless loop of despair.  The people who made this game are basically **** on new players and rewarding old players who got the game on time.  Hoyoverse is basically that one **** that gets you hooked on something then keeps it away from you making you into a desperate and helpless addict to what they offered while they revel in your misery.,1,10

Combat is a lot of fun, more so with a controller on PS5, but PC controls are fine too. You fall in love with each character for different reasons, they all have their own unique personalities & way of acting/talking, the story missions & cutscenes are amazing, the pace feels fast you don't feel like you're wasting time, you can teleport directly to most places, dailies are quick & easy to complete, they even shortened weeklies recently, very accessible game that's easy to get **** you love fun fast combat with loveable characters who have great designs, then check this game out !! I've earned plenty of S rank characters without having to pay for pulls, I use some of the A rank ones too. The brother sister duo running a video store set up is so cute & sending out agents on missions makes a lot more sense than just random people on a squad you switch between.

metacritic,Bagubuns,zenless-zone-zero,"Yet another Hoyoverse game that is style-over-substance. The presentation, again, is one of this company's strengths, but sometimes the characters are honestly TOO animated, and it makes some of the cutscenes feel a little childish for my taste. The combat actually feels a lot better than in Honkai Impact 3rd or Genshin Impact, but it's still too repetitive and simple. Even on challenge mode, there isn't anything challenging enough that mindlessly button mashing can't beat. The Gacha system is thankfully not as bad as it could be (the bar of being better than Genshin Impact's gacha system is SO low), but the very fact of it being a Gacha game at all ruins the game because of the reward incentive for slogging through the same repetitive gameplay loop. However, it's the story mode that really drops the ball. The pacing is really slow, and the game is dragged down by unfun puzzles and linear quests. Like, what the heck is this TV moving thing? Is it supposed to be their idea of fun? Wandering around the overworld is also pretty disappointing, given that this is a really stylistically interesting game with a seemingly bustling metropolitan area at your fingertips, but nothing of substance to really do. The defense of this game is that it's for those with less time to immerse into Genshin Impact or Honkai Star Rail or any of those games, and to its credit, the Hollow Zero Game mode is perfect for that, but the rest of the game feels like its wasting your time instead of providing bite-sized fun moments of gameplay for you to enjoy.",4,10

metacritic,Mia7a,zenless-zone-zero,"""Zenless Zone Zero"" offers a solid experience in terms of its core gameplay, but there are several aspects that hold it back. One of the main drawbacks is the monetization model—it’s a gacha game, which can be frustrating for players who don't want to spend money, as this can limit the ability to obtain certain characters or items. The game also implements an energy system, which restricts daily activities. This mechanic can be a significant hindrance, especially when you're eager to progress but have to wait for energy to recharge.Another negative aspect is the lack of investment in map-based activities. There’s so much potential for exploration, but the game doesn't capitalize on it as much as it could. Additionally, the mini-game events often feel dull and disconnected from the main storyline, making them less engaging.However, despite these issues, the game shines where it matters. The combat system is incredibly fun and dynamic, making every battle exciting. The existing stories and missions within the maps are enjoyable, and the characters are a blast to interact with—each bringing a unique personality to the table. While there are aspects of the game that could use improvement, the overall experience is still very good, with plenty of enjoyable content to keep you hooked.",8,10

metacritic,Caeruleus_CCXVI,zenless-zone-zero,"6.0/10Ive played this both on PC and Android as a Free to play player (FTP), Ive been playing since Launch for about 2 months/80 or so hours, I am Internot lvl52 and I have 2 full teams.~ I must say, the controls for this game are incredibly smooth on M/K, Controller and Phone. A very Mihoyo game, that is a general Action RPG with Action-Adventure/Hack and Slash feels much like Devil may cry or God of war. The first 10-20 hours of game play are really really easy to play through, you can just not step in the bad, and mash A essentially. However around the 20-30 hour mark and Internot lvl35-40/ Character level 45-50 the game spikes in difficulty and you have to start worrying about Team composition, quality and sets of gear. Then you remember that you are playing a Gotcha game made by Mihoyo and it all clicks. If you are patient, and do your basic research of what stats each character wants and give them appropriate gear, it all slowly comes together, even with being a FTP or low spender. This game is far more generous then Genshin was in its first 2 years, and about as generous as Star Rail has been this past year. For the story... its fine but it makes alot of the charecters endearing. These charecters have ALOT of personality, especially compared to much of Genshin Pre-Sumaru or Base Star Rail. I think the devs are slowly getting better at making charecters. I am currently playing both StarRail and ZZZ, and realized I can barely pay attention to 1 gotcha game, let alone 2, and thus I have dropped Genshin. I guess Mihoyo really has me by the balls. The game is fine, and good for filler time. I really think one you get through the story, that its just your basic working on charecters like a 2nd job. IF that is not your think, I would not recommend this. If you do, you might want to give it a try. If this wasnt a Gotcha game I would probably give it a 7.25/10... but man these games are really not ment to be played FTP, unless you really slow roll them haha.",6,10

This is an amazing game for what it does. Great combat, fun customization, interesting characters, a so-so story.

This is the first time I played a game like this and actually really attached myself to certain characters. Just really enjoyed their play style, how they moved, their voice lines or just how they are wrapped into the world/plot.

I don't understand the issues with the TV sections, i like them. It breaks things up a bit. It's like playing through puzzles and all interactive the whole time, it's not like you're there in silence. Maybe people who don't have as diverse of a taste of different genres may not have expected that but it's such a small part of the game.

There is so much to do but overall it will revolve around fighting or life sim stuff to get to know the characters and world. This world has me hooked and I'm really hoping skeptics give this a better chance.",9,10

三测50级，公测28级，我视频里说的三测的问题，公测几乎全都没改。且不是我一人觉得，公测后的环境说明我提的这些问题全都是大家都在意的。
本质就播片游戏，战斗反馈和交互完全不过关。所有即时演算都变成了播片。各种无效预输入，普攻优先级还出奇的高，甚至不是所有角色都有重击。一次格挡可以自动挡三下，连携技三四段连着二选一不能主动选择（像崩三就可以主动选）。全程都是呆着看播片，毫无动作体验。
战斗全靠夸张的特效和随意的震屏，卡肉也是做的意义不明，像是啥都想做，然后学得四不像。3A大作也是名不虚传，那些洗不是AAA的人也不知道在洗什么，抠掉平A还能造成伤害吗，所有操作都是以平A为基础，为平A服务，战技大招要靠平A叠层，闪避振刀也是为了给无脑平A留环境，没有立回，加上平A性能高，派生收益低，机制又被动，导致平A变最优解，没有交互性的东西还要假装自己要操作。
判断评价的标准也不是最佳连击数这种能依靠玩家技巧得到的评价，而是过关时间，只要角色数值越高，别说手脚了，把脑子砍掉时间也自然短。怪不攻击你的话你就只能在那A和搓招，触发协同了又会打断搓招。搓招也搓不出什么东西，游戏内连aaa都算连招的搓招表更是笑话，输入手段就这么几种，分支和派生少的可怜，再加上没有空战，地面技的丰富度完全支撑不起需求，配队方式和连招也限定住，几乎就只能用一种解法，配队可玩性和战斗丰富度太低。
各种人吹什么11号火刀还有双闪双反之类的操作，但是这些操作打到二三十级了总会自己试出来的，估计只有从头到尾只有闪避弹刀的人才会去大肆吹。底层交互垃圾了后面出再多角色也是无聊。又不是像鬼泣那样靠华丽连招打评分的，绝区零评分只看时间不看连招，数值够了抛开大脑都能满。
很多可利用机制也完全没利用，比如那个超大工程机器的大电锯，可以去特意蹭闪避，卡的好可以连着触发三四次，可以利用故意去蹭伤害来玩出很多花头，像弹幕游戏里“擦弹数”也是一个标准，但是绝区零实战还是数值，这些没用。
从崩三到原神到星铁到zzz，怪物设计一如既往的烂，几乎全是木桩等着让你打，攻击欲极低，瘫痪时间巨长，毫无博弈，就只能一直复现连招，然后又回到了连招的固定和匮乏的问题。偶尔有几只怪做的能看但也就那样。挑战模式和剧情模式更是几乎只有数值上的差距，一个动作游戏，不是靠手法而是靠数值来追上限，那这个游戏的上限也就肉眼可见的固定了。
不过公测的手柄震动适配和覆盖率大大提升（覆盖率高是最难得的，可能震动适配在市面上大概第三梯队的水平，但是覆盖率高让他有第二梯队的体验），超预期了，就是没做UI逻辑适配，过场动画的震动太夸张了，战斗的震动说实话真可以，手柄适配是突破了，这部分满意。
战斗走格子四六开，是想靠更无聊的走格子掩盖自己播片动作的事实吗。战斗比例能有四还是因为修脚刮痧导致的。除去战斗和养成之外的其他部分，明显都是顶级的技术力，但是这些都是用来“锦上添花”的，zzz的“锦”做的完全不过关，白瞎了这么高的技术力。不如去做番，但是剧情完全没16+的样子，而且做动画不如做游戏这种畜牧业容易。估计也是不可能了。
不过顶级技术力也只是相对，人物衣服依然随处可见人体彩绘的部分，而不是实体建模，8年一点长进都没，溢出屏幕的敷衍。
只要不把他看成是动作游戏，问题可能不至于这么大，但是他自己营销自己是动作游戏如果把它当做arpg也没法比，arpg最重要的两部分build和root，build方面经典圣遗物+命座+武器，配对基本基本没有深度可言，root方面作为抽卡手游更是被体力限制死了。
也许从低游戏性的二游角度来看待，综合实力不错，但是你米自己冰清玉洁，切割二游，那可由不得我从游戏性角度批判你了。
还有这宣发，先不说前瞻和对谈里的虚假宣传了。有道词典和天气预报都有你的广告广告随你打，商单随你发，但是别影响人们的日常生活行吗，哪里都有，还是最司马的弹窗形式，天天糊脸上，这宣发力度是我目前见过最恶心的游戏了。还有虚假宣传，你要是吹吹自己的特长就算了，偏偏要吹自己做的最烂的作为核心，还什么我们不会倾向做“夸张的特效和随意的震屏”，搬起石头砸自己的脚，自己把自己定位搞崩。
扣分项：
挂羊头卖狗肉（16+，动作性，爽）
怪物设计
走格子无聊
关卡设计
宣发影响日常生活；
加分项：
手柄震动反馈满意

metacritic,FehAaron,zenless-zone-zero,"Ok so, the game is kinda boring at the first chapter and scales up after chapter 2, people who complain that is just a ""mash-up the button gameplay"" is probably saying this because they played tutorial with Billy and think the whole gameplay is just that, and in fact it's not, there is a lot of character that need more thought behind what you are going to do and make and get better rewarded by that, specially characters like Soldier 11. Hoyo usually makes the game easy at the first months since people are starting the game out, but probably just like Star Rail, it'll definitely get harder and harder as time goes by.

Also, while it's not a problem to me, after a while we get lesser and lesser TV gameplay, and they told in the DevTalk that they will continue to avoid it

While the game does have it's flaws and I am very aware of that, I think the game is really overhated, people need to understand that just like some people prefer sonic, some people prefer mario, everyone has their preferences, If you don't like the game it does not mean that the game it's trash, it's just that your preference does not match what the game is offering, if you don't like the aesthetic, does not mean it's terrible and anyone will like it, it's that hard to accept that?",8,10

metacritic,dickjohnson777,zenless-zone-zero,"5 min of combat followed by 30min-1hr of boring walking around, talking, TV mazes. Nice looking models you can spend money on, but you can't even enjoy them on your own terms, you have to get past the wall of boring casual BS just to actually be your team. Then you get a few min to run around and button mash before being returned right back to a TV maze.

The biggest issue with the game is that it was marketed as a game who emphasize on combat. But in reality, it's a visual novel/puzzle game with a sprinkle of combat on top. People did not get what they were told they would get. So the game got pushed to a lot of players who are not interested in what they are offering. It's like going to a restaurant named XYZ tacos, and when you are done waiting in line and ready to take your order, you find out

Another main reason I hate about the game is that every time you're done a mission, you are force to go back to your shop and talk to your brother/sister then go to bed I go out the shop to talk to a NPC go back to shop to talk to brother/sister go to bed repeat.

Genshin came out years ago, and you can walk almost the whole world without a loading screen. And ZZZ needs a loading screen to go outside the small video store and another loading screen to go into the parking lot, it's dumb as hell…

New player experience is very important, and **** game doesn't hook you in during the honeymoon phase when you have way faster progression, and you unlock new things all the time and achievements and quests pop up all the time then it's going to experience a horrendous downfall during dry period.",1,10
metacritic,SlitherySerpent,zenless-zone-zero,"If this game was made before Genshin and Star Rail, it would of been perfect but seeing how everything in this is pretty much a copy/paste job. The combat areas are repetitive as well as the TV sequences, story is a so-so and can be skipped at least (this also shortens the utterly boring dialogue to a paragraph). Other than the comedy comic scenes and voice acting, it is really boring to watch.

ZZZ takes up a lot of space for something that limits a lot of areas from being accessed whether be in a fight or city exploring. Personally, there's nothing to be awe about. However, the characters are unique and has unique characteristics, but don't forget this is mihoyo and they've already done a good job with their predecessors.

The result of this game: very grindy/repetitive, definitely need lots of copium to deal with a huge part of this game, although it takes a second for loading screens (there is too much of it to properly enjoy the game), requires a bunch of transitioning, complex and confusing UI, poorly optimized on PC, enjoyable to an extent.",2,10

metacritic,DarthFronz85,zenless-zone-zero,"It's a well made, tightly playing action RPG as far as the combat is concerned and, so long as you can resist the allure of the Gacha mechanics, you have yourself a better-than-average free game. The characters and setting are clearly taking a lot of inspiration from the Persona series (Time of day cycles, missions you can do for people around a hub, shop Sim elements, and even a mission where you serve coffee in case the inspiration wasn't smacking you in the face hard enough). This is a good game to play when you want something that looks really nice and isn't too complicated.
The mechanics of combat are simple: Hammer attack until the enemy's stun Guage fills, then hammer your special to trigger a chain attack. Red flash from the enemy means dodge to get a slick slo mo counter and a yellow flash is an opportunity to swap to another party member on your squad to get a cool switch attack. Once you've gone buck wild a while, you can unleash a super attack. Simple and satisfying.
Having mentioned the gacha mechanics, the game has, so far, given me plenty of pulls and a lot of fun characters. The character design leans a little TOO heavy into weebs and furries for my personal taste (the human characters with shark tails are absolutely repulsive) but the overall design is what you'd expect from the JRPG crowd.
The cons: Menus. There are WAY to many menus in this game. There are several different menus in different areas where you claim rewards, all with more tabs to more menus. It's actually difficult to claim all the things you've earned because the game hides them all in separate menus.
Second, the currencies. I know this is a free to play model and this is how it goes, but holy cannot. You have a currency to pull normal players, a currency to pull exclusive players, a currency that can be used to purchase pulls for normal players, a currency that can be used to purchase pulls for exclusive players, a currency to buy Bangboo stuff, a currency to pull Bangboo, a slowly regenerating currency you can use to earn upgrade currencies for your characters. And again, I get what kind of game this is but the currency system is so unnecessary convoluted and the menus so dense and confusing that I genuinely had to stop and make sure I wasn't accidentally spending real money on currency rather than trading one in game currency for another. Even in a game where the idea is to get players to spend money to buy currency, I don't see why you can't just have a single premium currency to use for all your pulls. On the other hand, the team certainly aren't hiding the predatory aspects of the game; the vast number of unique currencies makes it painfully obvious to any but the most slow witted that this game is trying to use Sunk Cost Fallacy against the player.
Even if you want to sink money into the game, it's hard to know how. You have the City Fund, the battle pass, and a dozen premium currencies to choose from. As stated above for myself, who plans on spending nothing here, this is incredibly confusing. It's like the studio simultaneously wants to open all possible avenues for revenue AND ensure that players have the hardest possible time figuring out how to give away their cash. There are 36 ways into your wallet and each of them requires a detour for the detour to get there.
All in all, if you want a good looking game with a typical JRPG story and dumb-but-fun combat, you'll have a good time here. Oddly enough, ignoring the gacha elements actually leaves you with an above average game. If you actually want to spend money, good luck navigating those menus.",7,10

It's a game where the developers let you know from the first minute that that you will never be able to get anything you want from it and that you can forget about touching anything relevant unless you give them money.

The monetization is subhuman tier, there are bad gacha games out there but this one takes the crown, these ""people"" unironically released a game with a limited edition gacha with a character that is so unbelievably broken compared to the second in slot just to farm FOMO kids and filter non-p2w players, oh also this super limited character requires its limited equipment from the super limited equipment gacha, not even joking, how brain damaged you have to be to do this to your game? even the pathetic Tower of Fantasy wasn't this dumb! (even though they also did the limited gacha BIS character on release, maybe the idiots in charge of ZZZ took their idea)

The content you can do in the game is extremely limited by an archaic energy system, system that would make early Kongregate games laugh, and of course roadblocks, lots of roadblocks.

Overall it's a game you can play to have some 2-3 hours of fun but then you'll quit and forget it exists, it really gives a recyclable game vibe, it's weird because on some parts, for example the music, the animations and the puzzles are very well done but then the garbage monetization and FOMO fest takes over and slaps you in the face.

It's as if half of the game was made by actually competent developers and the other half by greedy clowns with no knowledge about the gaming community.",1,10
metacritic,Gamerrr123,zenless-zone-zero,ZZZ is a fun game that is relaxing and doesn't need lots of mantle power to play. I highly recommend if you like gacha games.,8,10
metacritic,Montiero,zenless-zone-zero,"Shockingly one dimensional. Combat is the only enjoyable gameplay but it makes up maybe 1/3 of all the gameplay. The rest is boring cutscenes and even more boring tv ""puzzles"". I can't believe how threadbare the game is. it's such a test of patience when you're stuck in yet another tv tile gameplay one after another after another and each time you get into combat, there's a loading out animation, loading screen, then an intro cutscene. EVERYTIME!!",4,10
metacritic,Drgameranting,zenless-zone-zero,"I don’t get why such simple scenes need constant loading. The combat is weak, and the battles are often interrupted by boring mini-games. Using sexy female characters to lure people into spending money on gacha is such an outdated tactic.",1,10
metacritic,nojunk9,zenless-zone-zero,"Beautiful game, women, animations, sounds, and art.  Horrible gameplay.

How your time is spent:
10% - combat, that is mostly a mess of mashing one button on your mouse
55% - watching and reading text
10% - trying to figure out what all the currency is used for and how
5% - navigating a linear corridor that has nice art but nothing to do there
10% - navigating the horrible TV mini-game designed for a 9 year old
5% - enjoying some parts of the story and animation
5% - looking at all the character details and trying to figure out what to equip, upgrade, etc. so you can do a tiny but more damage",2,10
metacritic,Alsethe2nd,zenless-zone-zero,"This game feels like the worlds longest tutorial.

With beautiful animations can badass character designs I can't blame anyone for wanting to try this game out, not to mention the alluring free tag. However this game is severely lacking in fun gameplay loops and drive.

It feel like there is nothing really to do in this game, the combat while smooth and visually impressive leaves a lot to be desired mechanically, basically containing 2 dodging mechanics 2 attack buttons and characters that feel like they play the same despite having completely different weapons.

Unlike over Hoyoverse games this one is lacking in the addictive nature and the common things that make you want to play it. The summoning animation is kind of long and boring. The daily rewards don't really matter because it means you'd have to play the game. Honestly if you want to get in to this game for the character animations and story (which personally like all mihoyo games I feel like the story is not good) then you might as well watch someone else play because those are the only real things in this game that shine.

The game is far from horrible, the game is far from good. Would only recommend when you need to kill time and have nothing better to do.",5,10
metacritic,Avenged13,zenless-zone-zero,"Pros ++ Combat is enjoyable, characters are cute and lighthearted. 
Im in love with the anime style.

I do not understand this design choice.
Things got really stale really fast when there is nothing to loot and nothing to explore.",7,10
metacritic,SgtSeagull47,zenless-zone-zero,"Fun combat, and the character design is great, each character really pops and the voice acting is pretty good too. It is a gacha game so beware of that, kinda dumb people rate it bad solely on that fact, you can tell tho they had no idea what they were getting into, it's hoyoverse of course it's a gacha ya Dumbos that's what they do, how about you do some research before diving in instead of going in blind and rating it bad just because it's a gacha. Don't pay any mind to those half brain dead reviews that rate it bad because it's a gacha, they need to get their bag up. It blows you can't run around as your agents tho and are stuck exploring as the MC. Only reason I didn't give it a ten, well that and the story is kinda lack luster, idek what the plot is and I've been playing for a few days straight now.",8,10
metacritic,TrueOptimist,zenless-zone-zero,"Really good combat, that feels great when you get the combos and counters going. The style is also really good, as the game just looks great when playing and in cut-scenes. Has a very Persona-like look to it. The character design is also what you would expect from a miHoYo game, very cool. Lots of dialog, but most of it is throwaway, it makes some of the game just drag. 

The action is where it's at and I just want more of that. However, at the end of the day, its not a cool open world like Genshin is. It's really just small battle arenas with waves of dudes when you break it down. Because of that, it probably does not have the legs like Genshin does.",8,10

metacritic,tetryonx,zenless-zone-zero,"Eh I don't know, I guess this game is not for me. I tried to enjoy it, but the combat, while visually impressive, is just too simplistic to be enjoyable. The story, at least initially, is not compelling. Perhaps it gets better but I just couldn't get into it. 
The tv movement ""puzzle"" gameplay is just... bad. Why does it exist as an seemingly important gameplay aspect? This feels like a 100-level CS project thrown into the middle ****. Perhaps it works better on mobile since the expectations bar is so low there? Somehow a core mechanic of this game is worse than throw away events for Genshin Impact.

The character designs are top-notch, as expected from mihoyo, constantly outdoing themselves in this regard. 
Although the game's world is interesting, visually appealing and well built, the story is relatively average, at least in the first several hours of gameplay; but it is something I have personally come to expect from games of this genre.

So far i can see i hvnt even touched more than the surface of content, and i like that the core of the characters is so simple. I think itll start to pop off once im done with the story (which is also a fun grounded character driven romp) and then itll start kicking my ass with me neeeding to balance character and team resources better.

Short overview of the patches

2.0 Inazuma update, weaker begining but the atmosphere of Japanese culture was done great, so in the end all was great
3.0 Sumeru update, great from the start, atmosphere is based in culture of India, Egypt, Mesopotamia
4.0 Fontaine update, great start, weak mid, great ending, atmosphere is based on French culture
5.0 Natlan update, weakest region yet released, the atmosphere is all over the place, more like mixed bag of Africa, Mayan, Modern day technologies, Western, Hawai.... still well done main story and exploring, but the atmosphere isnt united to draw you in.

metacritic,Frai,genshin-impact,"Considero que el juego a nivel de arte y música es maravilloso pero realmente, el nivel de grindeo y farmeo es abusivo. Colocan impedimentos para no poder farmear y limitaciones innecesarias que hacen que el juego sea más cuesta arriba. 

En el apartado gráfico el juego cumple con las expectativas a mi parecer, realizando buenos desenfoques de cámara también, en el sentido de dirección y como te van mostrando el mundo es tedioso en algunas regiones aunque en otras es mejor. 

El tiempo que se le debe de invertir al juego es muy excesivo haciendo que para un jugador novicio le cueste consumir el juego y desbloquear contenido importante para los jugadores.

La interfaz con el tiempo ha ido mejorando pero hay cosas que se tienen que pulir. Como decirte que es obligatorio usar arco en los dominios para no hacerte perder 20 o 30 minutos, para después darte cuenta que en el dominio toca hacer una parte en la que debes de usar un arco.

Referente al juego es un gachapon y como gachapon a diferencia de su competencia la relación compensación/tiempo invertido, no es grata para las mayorias de jugadores debido a que el juego exige personajes promocionales en muchas instancias, y a la mayoria de jugadores les cuesta conseguir un equipo bueno para completar los contenidos.

A nivel de combate visualmente es hermoso pero realmente no es muy llamativo no es la gran cosa, básicamente no es muy complejo como un Hack n Slash, un Street Fighter o un juego especializado en el combate técnico. 

Aunque han tratado de incluir mecanicas para innovar en la forma que se tiene de jugar, pero eso en parte es contraproducente ya que no todos los personajes pueden gozar de dichas mecanicas y solo benefician a muy pocos (promocionales, para que tengas que conseguirlos).

Los packs de compras no valen la pena realment, solo vale la pena comprar la bendición o el pase (si lo tienes lleno obviamente). Una persona F2P obviamente puede conseguir equipos META pero tiene que invertirle bastante tiempo, llevo 2 años en el juego y apenas tengo 2 equipo META bien armados ya que se necesita mucho tiempo e inversión para conseguir personajes decentes.

Algunas regiones son sosas y muchas areas del mapeado y de su historia no tiene sentido como el desierto de Sumeru, algunas zonas de Inazuma pero principalmente la peor Región y la más sosa es Sumeru ya que esta cargada de mucho texto que no te deja avanzar y explorar gustamente como pasa en otras regiones como: Mondstadt, Liyue y **** eventos la mayoría son buenos algunos mejores que otros pero sus eventos de combates el algunos casos no suelen ser divertidos pero al menos los eventos recompensan a los jugadores aunque podrían ser mejor en todos los sentidos.

En el apartado historico el juega peca mucha de la redundancia y de no ir al grano una novela gráfica como Ace Attorney tiene menos texto (la trilogia) comparandolo con las historias SECUNDARIAS de Sumeru con los aranara y EL DESIERTO, los guionistas no saben diferenciar lo PRINCIPAL con lo Secundario, lo secundario tiene que ser secundario y no tiene que ser tan sustancioso porque el jugador no siente que este haciendo una gran cosa.

Siguiendo con las misiones e historias, pues el juego peca mucho de obligarte a hacer misiones para simplemente desbloquear zonas del mapa o poder explorar el mapa, pudiendo hacerlo más rapido y menos tedioso para el jugador. Pero deciden por tener un equipo de novelistas frustrados que celebran tener más de 1 millón de diálogos en sus vídeo juegos que son redundantes y no aportan nada a la historia.Dicho todo esto le daré un 6 al vídeo juego. 

Si te gusta juégalo, lo disfrutaras al máximo todo lo que tiene pero realmente peca en muchos sentidos y no trata bien a sus jugadores. Aunque últimamente están haciendo bien las cosas pero realmente lo mal hecho, hecho esta y no podrá ser borrado.",6,10
metacritic,FuriousGamerX,genshin-impact,"Positives: Genshin Impact stands out for its stunning visuals, which truly bring the fantasy world of Teyvat to life. The game’s art style is vibrant and well-detailed, with various regions offering a mix of landscapes that keep exploration visually refreshing. Adding to the charm, the game’s soundtrack is often breathtaking, with orchestrated music that enhances the emotional and immersive experience, especially in boss fights and open-world exploration. Additionally, the co-op mode adds a layer of fun when playing with friends, offering moments of teamwork and shared adventure, especially in harder domains or events. Negatives: However, the game has some major drawbacks. The quests often feel repetitive and uninspired, and the main story does little to stand out among other RPGs, coming across as rather average. The world, though beautiful, can feel empty after prolonged play, as many areas lack meaningful interaction or diverse activities. The absence of a skip dialogue button can be frustrating, as a large portion of the gameplay is spent in long-winded conversations with NPCs, making it feel like the game forces you to sit through unnecessary dialogue. Another significant issue is the presence of sexualized content, which might make some players uncomfortable. The game also suffers from occasional bugs, which can disrupt the experience, and the NPCs often feel like mere copies of one another, lacking unique personality or visual differences. Puzzles throughout the game are largely repeated, making them feel monotonous over time, and grind-heavy mechanics are a constant theme, as players are required to repeatedly do the same daily tasks or events. The game pushes players into a repetitive cycle, which can feel tiresome, especially with certain activities only available on specific days or a weekly treasure limit that restricts progress. There are additional frustrations, such as the inability to heal your characters multiple times in quick succession, which can make certain battles more tedious than challenging. Final Verdict: Despite its artistic brilliance and some engaging multiplayer elements, Genshin Impact falls short in terms of story, variety, and gameplay balance. The frequent repetition, lack of meaningful interactions, and dialogue-heavy nature detract from the overall enjoyment. For these reasons, Genshin Impact scores 3/10, with points awarded for music, the world design, and co-op fun.",3,10
metacritic,wlsrnsk1243,genshin-impact,"At the time of its release, it was viewed negatively as ""a game that copies The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild,"" but it gained huge traction with better quality and various content than expected. However, behind the scenes, there was a hidden intention to attract users by pretending to be a common console game and making them use gacha (random pulls), which is ridiculously expensive. The characters were promoted with PV videos filled with colorful effects and exaggerated production that cannot be experienced in the actual game. Characters and weapons were sold at high prices, comparable to buying several AAA games with each update. To exploit the desire to equip beloved characters with good weapons, they sold weapons to them at much higher than characters prices. It's a very clever strategy. 

After spending $1,000 over three years, I realized there are many better games than this one, and I could have spent my money more wisely. Once I recognized my folly, the hidden shortcomings of this game began to become apparent. In villages and cities, many NPCs share the same face, and also many buildings that cannot be entered. NPCs with identical appearances(recycling 3D models) even play important roles in the main story, which significantly undermines immersion. Additionally, players are forced to listen to esoteric, lengthy explanations of proper nouns and settings unique to Chinese games, as the story cannot be skipped. 

Feedback and improvement on areas that users find uncomfortable are also very slow. If an issue is unfavorable to Hoyoverse, they tend to be unresponsive and engage in conflicts with users. This game is quite good and I have had enjoyable moments, but my affection for it has faded. It has been over four years since Genshin Impact was released, and despite the availability of many higher-quality games, users continue to spend a lot of money on Genshin Impact and pulls slot machine's lever. Meanwhile, if a AAA game is released for $70, it is considered expensive, leading players to either refrain from buying it or wait for a Steam sale. This reality is quite unfortunate. Genshin Impact's success is due to Hoyoverse's meticulous strategy and marketing, but I believe it's time to share the rewards with latecomers.",0,10
metacritic,KyokoTheSimp,genshin-impact,"I’ve started playing Genshin like 3 years ago and at first I was totally amazed by its fantastic graphics, cool characters and easy gameplay. I’m still playing it today, but now I can tell that there are quite a few negative aspects to it. The main way to get new playable characters is through a gacha system, but unfortunately it’s really difficult to get all the characters you want unless you invest really much time in the game or spend money on it. The main story is really long and detailed, so detailed that it’ll eventually get pretty annoying to focus on it without getting lost in other side quests. On top of all that the character designs are really superficial and idealized, maybe not as much as in other anime style games, but still the fantasy waifu/husbando image is really prominent. As I said it’s still a cool game and since it’s (mostly) free to play I would give it a try, just be careful not to get too caught up in it.",7,10

metacritic,Timyroof,genshin-impact,"Поиграл первый раз в 2020 году, уже тогда заскучал в ней, потом вернулся в 2022, и эта игра меня поработила, провёл в ней, наверное, сотни часов, прокачался до 56 ранга и жалею о потраченном времени.
Гача ужасная, фарм артефактов ещё хуже, бездна скучная, особенно раздражает таймер, без которого она была бы в разы лучше, сюжет Мондштата и Ли Юэ банальный, неинтересный, мне немного понравился сюжет Инадзумы и Разлома, но минусы игры это не перекрывает. Гача это, по сути, завуалированное казино, конечно ты радуешься, когда тебе везёт, но гораздо больше ты разочаровываешься, если не везёт.

В этой игре куча манипулятивных механик, заставляющих тебя играть, особенно ограниченные по времени баннеры.

Можно не сражаться с мобами, а просто стоять и заметить что многие из них образно говоря по полчаса стоят и ничего не делают, это ультраказуально, и ведь игра то одиночная (кооп почти бесполезный) можно было спокойно сделать нормальную смену сложности, которая повышала бы ИИ мобам и те бы не стояли как истуканы, но зачем делать игру лучше, если и так донатят.

This game doesn't have a skip button, so you'll be listening (or reading) for 90 percent of a certain story quest or whatever, it doesn't have a good balance of gameplay mixed in. Next, even if you autplay something, you are required to make choices that have zero impact and don't branch.Overall, just screw this game.

metacritic,Bagubuns,genshin-impact,"Genshin Impact is impressive when it comes to presentation. The music, scale, visuals, character designs, and much more are extremely engaging or immersive. However, the game's open world feels extremely shallow, especially given its influencer, Breath of the Wild. It's near impossible not to compare these games because to be frank, Genshin Impact's own identity is extremely limited. However, the things that it takes as its own, like the focus on story or the RPG elements, work against the game. Doing quests makes moving around the world feel tedious, since you will usually have a map marker located on your objective. The way Breath of the Wild handled quests was that it would hint to you where the quest may be located, but the marker would only indicate where the quest would originate, allowing you to actually use your eyes to study the environmental design and solve the puzzle. Genshin Impact's approach encourages linearity, and while there are still breadcrumb elements, the importance of the quests draws the player away from checking out those elements. The Gacha system is also one of the most expensive and predatory Gacha systems by far. I understand this game is literally the most expensive video game of all time, but scum is scum. I have to praise it for its better elements like the fleshed out elemental system, or the multiplayer, but that does not change what the game is at its core.

MAYBE ONE DAY THAT MIGHT TELL...",1,10
metacritic,JeffX24,genshin-impact,"After playing this game for 3 years I wouldn't recommend playing it. 
I start with the story. The story itself is interesting, but you will miss out portions of the story or the lore because most of them are only playable in the current update. If a next update comes up, you either have to hurry and finish the story or you will miss out the content. The devs punishes player for not playing and for a newcomer it is not worth it.
The other issue is the wishing system. There is a standard banner, a weapon banner and a limited banner, which features limited characters. Each of them are 5 stars. The problem with the wishing system is that the character or weapon isn't even guaranteed. You have to atleast make 80-90 wishes for a 5 star weapon or character and if you are unlucky, you get a charcter or weapon from the standard banner. If you fail once on the limited banner, you have to make an additonal 80-90 wishes to get your guaranteed character. On the weapon banner you have to fail twice to guarantee your weapon. The limited banner last for a month and either you grind for the wishes or they encourage you to spent money on them.
Now I will talk about the gameplay. The gameplay is nice, but only, if you have the characters, weapons and good artifacts. If one of them (especially artefacts) is missing, the experience isn't as good as it should be. The artifacts have random stats and even if you have some good ones, you have to level up the stats too and it is NOT guaranteed which stat will level up. It is just frustrating to see how often it messes up your artifact and the game itself runs with an energy mechanic, which prevents you from playing, unless you pay for it.
Then there is the issue with the devs themselves. They earn millions of dollars and they give less in return. A good example is the third anniversary, where they only gave 3 wishes for our ""loyal support"". This was really a slap on the face for the players and they didn't changed it. They ignore complaints and act if everything is fine, but they will only lose more players. To all of you who are reading this, please don't play this game. You only support this company and they will never learn from their mistakes.
All in all, Genshin Impact is a Gacha game with the worst lootbox system and unbearable gameplay, if you don't have the right things. Just enjoy other games. This isn't just worth the time and money.",0,10

the main strong points being, the archon questline, world building, puzzles and exploration;
and the main weak points being lots of dialogue in some of the mundane quests feeling like filler, a very limited library of character animations, playable character building feeling very grindy and annoying at some points.
To me, Genshin as a whole clicked after archon quest finale in Inazuma, its 3rd region.

metacritic,Terros21,genshin-impact,"Я дал игре еще шанс. В конце концов некоторые моменты все же улучшились. Но тут я прошел свежайший сюжет Фонтейна, прошел персональный сюжет Фурины. Разработчики приложили много усилий чтобы нас растрогать и в целом весьма успешно. После я получил себе Фурину, открыл всю ее биографию. В последней главе биографии оказалось что Фурина в промежутке между этими слезодавительными сюжетками пошла на алко-вечеринку, там написалась и полезла на стол. Это моментально обнулило всю позитивизацию персонажа. Я не против спорных персонажей, но в том случае когда эти персонажи подаются спорными в основном повествовании, а не спрятаны в самом конце чтобы разочарование пришло после того как ты потратил игровые/денежные ресурсы и свое время.Например Венти подавался как неловкий алкоголик сразу же и получая его вы знали чего вы хотели и на что вы тратитесь. Подача Фурины это по сути подача красивой конфеты, а то что это не так и вся эта красивая обертка содержит ""так себе"" содержимое вы узнаете уже при приличных инвестициях ресурсов и времени. К тому же получите обман ожиданий. При этом абсолютно непонятно для чего этот момент был вообще добавлен. Он буквально ломает всю историю. Для чего нам сопереживать Фурине если ей отлично помогает любой алкоголь и толпа случайных людей вокруг? Как по мне так просто горилла писавшая это развелась с женой, пошла на алко-вечеринку, делала там кринж и почувствовала себя свободной, счастливой и не одинокой. Ну и после решила поделиться с нами.

From the moment I stepped into its beautifully crafted world, I felt something rare – a deep connection not just to the story or gameplay, but to the characters **** cast is what truly elevates this game to a masterpiece. Each character is rich with personality, backstory, and charm – it’s impossible not to get attached. They’re more than just units or fighters; they feel like real companions.

metacritic,Dark_Aethron,wuthering-waves,"The game isn't bad up till it comes to challenges, tests, and world bosses. Including many events. It's so un-ballenced that enemies can hit you one time and kill you. The cool down on item use is **** & needs to be taken off. The co-op isn't co-op. Frankly their reasoning lacks any validation of any kind. The co-op is completely waist of time. I will not pay for anything as long as it lack co-op. There should never be as many restrictions and limitations if they got on the co-op. You can't do events together, you can't collect chess when you kill bosses or enemies, you can't share loot in any kind of way shape or form, you can't help each other in challenges or tests. Even if you could you can't collect from it. Then they got it to where you literally have to pay some sort of gyms or whatever just to collect from bosses you complete on your own game. You should always be able to collect from enemies and bosses that you kill regardless if you're in your own game or co-op. The grind is repetitive excessive and extremely Petty. The cost of things is extremely high and the ability to get the money to be able to afford the stuff to craft synthesize etc is so grindy that I feel like I'm just getting nowhere. I'm level 60 and I was fighting an enemy that was only level 40 and it kicked my ass. It was a test challenge. You fight the same creature and another location as a boss but yet this test challenge can hit you one time being a level 40 and kill you. It wiped all three of my characters out with one single hit. Then you got to do World scaling if you want to be able to have any kind of chance of beating them but you can only do it every 12 hours. They make this a pay to win game for the most part. Even then many of the items in which you would want or need you can't even purchase. You have no ability to sell anything that you're not using. You can't convert currency to other currencies. The character development itself is horrible because you can't improve stats that you would want to prove or need to improve. They got you equipping Spirit energy where they should be allowing you to even equip armor. The spirit energy should be synthesized or equippable things into the armor itself to enhance the armor and give it specially facts. Then you can only summon one monster that you have equipped it in lead slot I said it being it was like three which one you want to summon. I like that you can summon or transform but they needed to make it to where you could actually have access to all the ones that you have equipped. Then you don't even have a hot bar for the health items so you get literally push the start screen in order to go to the backpack and select a health item in which has a cooldown timer. I can understand some things may need to cool down timer but not when it comes to health items or any of that stuff. I feel at this point they just were trying to do a fast game product for money purposes. All the predecessor games like this one has had pretty much the same similar reviews and many people have complained about the same thing and yet developers have not learned and created a game to correct these things. I bet you if I had the time the money and the programmers I can produce a game 100 times better than this one. The fact that I'm able to create a tabletop game that people would rather play than this says something in itself. Because I absolutely created a tabletop game that people would choose over this any old day. And I'm not a rich person I don't have a lot of power influence or resources but if I can create a tabletop game that puts this to shame and any other game that this company has ever made put it to shame what's that tell you? My game literally catches the attention of all types of people from young to old from different backgrounds from a different affiliations etc. I've had people love characters so much that when they died in the story mode they actually cried and some people got so upset that they refused to continue playing unless there was a way to bring them back. If I can literally develop a game that's a tabletop that does all this then that tells you I'm a definitely better developer than any of these people making these games and that tells you if I were given the resources and stuff I'd be able to create something that would overlap over top of new out perform any games these money grubbing unintelligent lazy pathetic wannabe creative designers. I challenge them to actually create a game better than what I have created and I even challenge them to actually participate in a couple of my sessions and find out for themselves. Remember being that I am a legal mind and I have legal resources this game that I created is absolutely protected and a number of different ways. So I absolutely would tell people that don't waste your time definitely don't waste your money this game is kind of a pathetic loser's attempt at trying to get money.",0,10
metacritic,Zytex,wuthering-waves,"It was a great game when it started, but it's clearly improving. Beautiful visuals, great combat and movement mechanics. The story is getting better and the storytelling itself is unparalleled, not just in this genre. The rewards are not bad either, and the KuroGames pays more attention to players than others.",10,10
metacritic,Lannuser,wuthering-waves,"Among gacha games, this is probably one of the best. Unlike other games, the powercreep is barely existent, with 1.x units still being meta as of writing this. 

However, the game also has a lot of flaws. Echo (artifact/relic)farming is atrocious. The rates are incredibly bad, almost all echoes you get will be unusable, and if you do get a good echo, it'll just roll into bad substats like defense & HP.

QA testing is also pretty bad. The game is filled with typos, even in weapon & character screens, and especially in 1.0 world quests. The English voice acting is also non-existent for any world quests, and the voicework overall is really bad for 1.0 quests.

The map-design is also bland and uninspired in the first area, leaving most of the map feeling the same. In contrast, Rinacita is a massive improvement in every aspect.

The fact some events are marketed as permanent is also misleading, as the good rewards are only available for a limited time, making them unattainable for new or returning players. This results in those players having little reason to ever complete these permanent events. 

While this game is marketed as a step-up from Genshin, it fails to deliver on this promise. It's a marginal improvement, riddled with the same predatory tactics and bad game-design aspects as its competitors.",8,10

metacritic,equinox00,wuthering-waves,"After playing this game for two months, I have to say that it’s one of the most overhyped game in its genre. It feels completely soulless because the devs lack a clear vision. They keep changing the concept, seemingly unsure of their own ideas, so they just copy whatever is popular instead of committing to something original. The storytelling is not good, a lot of awkward transitions, bloated dialogue, and fake choices that change nothing because the story is completely linear. But hey, just throw in a cutscene, and people will call it ""peak."" The character stories are even worse, feeling more like advertisements than actual narratives. Thankfully, the skip button exists, so I don’t have to suffer through them. Environmental storytelling is almost nonexistent because the world only exists as a backdrop. The cities are poorly designed, making little sense, and most areas feel like nothing more than chest farms with no real depth. Combat is actually solid, but the rest of the game is so lacking that I just log in, claim rewards, and wait for the next major patch, hoping for something worthwhile. As for the gacha and grinding system, there’s no point in even discussing it. Everyone already knows how bad it is. Overall, the game has potential, but too many fundamental flaws hold it back from being a good game.",3,10
metacritic,pablve,wuthering-waves,"I have invested time and effort into this game, but unfortunately, the experience has been frustrating. The reward system seems designed to cause more frustration than satisfaction. I've repeatedly faced situations where, even after multiple attempts, I fail to get what I'm looking for. And when I finally obtain something, it's in the wrong context!While the game is visually appealing and has potential, these mechanics generate a feeling of imbalance and unfairness that discourages progress. It feels more like playing at a casino than progressing in a well-designed game. I believe the developers should reconsider their RNG (random number generator) mechanics or implement a pity system for players who spend a lot of time trying to move forward.I hope they improve these aspects in future updates because the game has a good concept, but in its current state, I wouldn't recommend it.",2,10

The new regions, characters, events, rewards… Everything is perfect. The game is very fun and enjoyable. As a former Genshin player, if you like Genshin Impact you should try this game. The initial story is a bit mediocre but after that, it keeps getting better and better. Also the devs listen very well to the community so that is a bonus.",10,10
metacritic,Shirobot,wuthering-waves,"Wuthering Waves gets a lot of praise from its community for being better than Genshin Impact. In some ways, it is -- in many other ways, it isn't. The combat is significantly better and more challenging than Genshin Impact and travel in the game is very fast and free. But what really takes away from this game is how painfully it wants to be Genshin Impact and fails to do so on a number of other levels rather than just simply be its own thing. 

In nearly every facet of the game's design, the developers have shamelessly copied the design of their competitor. Since the developer is Chinese, it's not wholly unexpected since innovation is not something the Chinese do particularly well, but while Genshin was able to steal a lot of design from Japanese action games like BotW and set itself apart as an inspired clone with a degree of quality, Wuthering Waves has a second-rate feel to it. The community is also beyond obnoxious and constantly gaslight themselves into thinking they're playing this masterpiece when it's really just another slop waifu gacha with a completely absent degree of charm and very little originality.

The end-game is a boring lift and shift of Genshin's abyssal spire (which most Genshin players don't even enjoy doing anymore) with the same tendency to provide buffs that incentivize pulling the current banner character. 

The gacha system also masquerades as generous, but when players realize that almost every character in the game is worthless without their signature weapon, the illusion of f2p-friendliness also quickly fades.

It might be a fun distraction for a while, but if you've played Genshin Impact before, you'll quickly realize you're playing it all again with a different coat of paint and that's simply not good enough to warrant your time or money.

More Genshin clones are due to land this year and perhaps one of them will be good enough to dethrone Hoyoverse's market leader status, but Wuthering Waves isn't it. What is certain is that other games which attempt a strategy similar to WuWa's of copying Genshin wherever possible instead of bringing a fresh spin to a genre which is now tired and outmoded are also bound to languish in mediocrity much in the same way.",3,10

If you played & liked Genshin Impact, you'll love this, it has everything Genshin has but better, it does everything Genshin does, but better. Combat is a lot more fun & fluid, the navigation is great, you can run, grapple, climb/wall run & jump to get around 10x faster. This is definitely the open world gacha to play in 2025, Genshin feels 10 years older compared to it. 

If there's one thing Genshin/StarRail/ZZZ does better it's storylines & characters, you can actually follow stuff & learn about things in HoYoVerse. In WUWA it's like most people are just cardboard cutouts with pretty faces, you never really get to know anyone, despite the million cut scenes & dialogue, it feels thrown together with no heart.

metacritic,HaloBlues,wuthering-waves,"Ugh, it's so frustrating to have to rate this low. This has so much potential. There's so much fun to be had here, and so much I know I'll love once it's all worked out - the combat is fun and varied, the parkour around the open world is great, most of the character designs are interesting, I'm already intrigued by some of the characters, the puzzles are enjoyable, the currency and drop rates are incredibly generous compared to other gacha games I'm used to, the animations are fluid and well-done, and I can just... see that this could be a game I love. However, this was nowhere near ready for release. There are countless issues that should absolutely not have remained in the game through editing and quality-checking and testing. I've been playing this for two days, and so far a non-comprehensive list of issues are: 1) Frame rate, lag, and mind-blowingly unoptimised gameplay. You'll be lucky to get anything lower than 200 ping most of the time, and even moving the camera around will cause it to completely drop into a few frames per second for, like, a whole minute until it gets its **** together again. I saw people saying that it helps to have Genshin Impact running in the background, which I thought was bizarre because why would another big open-world game running at the same time make this one faster, but after trying it I can attest that oddly this does help. Not substantially, mind you, it's still agonisingly laggy, but there's a noticeable difference. This makes it borderilne unplayable for a lot of people, and even I, as a pretty patient player, am finding it hard to wade through it, especially when I'm constantly having to retry timed challenges over and over because the lag makes them impossible to do half the time. 2) The subtitles just cut off after three lines per text box, and there's no way to scroll down to read the rest of the line. If you're playing with anything other than the English dub, you're out of luck, because you're going to miss out on a chunk of information every time it happens. 3) Voice lines also just randomly cut off halfway through speaking. 4) So, so many typos, duplicated words, etc. 5) The voice acting is... spotty. This wouldn't be so bad if the single worst-acted character wasn't basically the one you spend the most time with for the first chunk of the game. Yangyang's voice acting is robotic, flat, slow, amateur, whatever criticism you want to level at it, and you won't be able to escape her for hours. It leaves a bad first impression. Other characters are genuinely well-acted, particularly Mortefi and Scar from the ones I've met so far, but... zoinks. They also hired a predominantly English cast and then for some reason made them all do American accents, so a bunch of their accents keep slipping into English, particularly Yangyang and Chixia. 6) Instances of subtitles not matching what a character is saying, or characters' dialogue getting mixed up. For example, I just experienced Mortefi saying a line, my dialogue option was to say his exact same line back to him, then Mortefi was shown saying what my character was supposed to say, and then resumed his normal dialogue afterwards. Anyway - it's, obviously, a blatant copy of Genshin, and the protagonist is very 'Trailblazer from Star Rail', but there are other successful games out there that do the same thing (e.g. Tower of Fantasy), so that's not necessarily the issue. Hoyo doesn't seem to care. I really hope this all gets fixed and patched sooner rather than later. I can tell I'll love the combat, once I can experience it at anything higher than, y'know, 5FPS. Definitely don't recommend until these things are worked on.",2,10

Graphics are better, combat is much more fun and has good skill expression to it, Storytelling (cinematics, camera angles, animation) are very good as well. In a sense many of us would wish it wasn't gacha but while it is gacha atleast it doesn't ""scam"" you that much due to better banner system.

ou alors c'est des niveaux trolls ou ""automatiques"" et c'est comme ça pour 90% des niveaux.",8,10
metacritic,kideayduwi,super-mario-maker-2,"it is an amazing game that i would recommend to any and everybody, you can spend hours making your own courses and worlds with the large amount of things that you can use to make your level/course however you like.this game has a story mode with premade levels by nintendo which alone would justify the price of this game but you are able to play levels and worlds made by other people. The main focus of the game, where you make courses is great and the feeling that you get when you see how many people played and liked your courses is amazing. So far i have spent around 85 hours on this game and even though it is not perfect, it is the closest thing to it. The online is decent and it is enjoyable to race other people on courses but at times it does start to lag a little bit. you can choose from many different environments and themes from across the mario series/franchies and even choose among the different game styles from the series, such as: super mario bros 1, super mario bros 3, super mario world, super mario bros u deluxe and super mario 3d world.",10,10

metacritic,PhilippeAlves,super-mario-maker-2,"Apesar de ter gostado bastante deste segundo jogo por ter mecânicas novas a sensação ainda é a de um jogo incompleto, por alguns motivos, Primeiro que o modo offline dele é bem curto e fácil de concluir, segundo que ele passa a mesma sensação do seu antecessor, que falta algo, falta mecânicas, falta personagens pra ser inseridos no mapa, inimigos, mais visuais de fases e backgrounds, o modo world editor é um ponto forte, mas carece de mais opções personalizáveis, a sensação é que eles ja fizeram o Mario Maker na intenção de fazer um segundo e este na intenção de um terceiro, um jogo fragmentado.

metacritic,mariofloresmx,super-mario-maker-2,This game made me think there was no further way to improve a 2D Mario platformer as most of the 2D Mario Style art and mechanics are already into this game giving players the ability to create our own levels thus the fun factor is endless.

metacritic,Maks1235,super-mario-maker-2,"A masterpiece that only could be created by Nintendo. This game is incredible and only builds on what the Wii U revolutionised for this series of games. Including for the first time a story mode, which is wonderful and has good lore while also being filled to the brim with easter eggs and fun new items and level design. The final scene is cute and heart-warming. The versus mode is the only complaint, with it being absolute ****. I didn't play it much so it didn't really affect me but it was annoying at times. The editor and brand new world editor give you so many tools to create levels the possibilities are endless. This game is an infinitely replayable game, since people make new levels every day. This game also introduces Super Worlds, with the user being able to build and customise your own Mario themed worlds.  No wonder this is my most played game on the switch with 180 hours. 9.3/10 Would highly recommend.",9,10
metacritic,reviewMaster432,super-mario-maker-2,"The game is burdened by a host of limitations that ultimately hold back its creative potential. One of the most glaring issues is how small and short the playable areas remain, which significantly restricts the scale and ambition of levels. Why not have 3 possible subareas and bigger ones? There's also a lack of an infinite timer option which is one of the most requested features during MM1. On top of that, level themes are frustratingly rigid, as liquids like lava, water, and poison are locked to only two themes for some reason. This prevents creative combinations like lava forests, lava grassy plains, poison deserts, or haunted house lava levels. It's impossible to make such combinations, which completely goes against this game's supposed ""experimentation"" philosophy. Nintendo tried to add more variation with the new night themes but failed miserably. They all look exactly the same which is really strange given that a level theme's main purpose is to give visual variety. And the music is really bad too, which honestly has made many people not want to use them. They all have their own unique effects like sandstorms, low gravity, the level turning upside down, etc, which is again a horrible way to implement such things and removes experimentation. A lava underground level with darkness isn't possible, so is a submerged airship with a sandstorm during the night, a waterless forest with low gravity, or a castle filled with poison, with a slippery floor, at night, nothing of this is possible, at all. Now, do you see how unfathomably much missed potential this game has? It'd be much better to have the night themes as additional aesthetic variations with no preloaded effects and let the player freely choose the effect(s) as a level setting instead. Paired with liquid freedom, this would open up countless possibilities and combinations, yet Nintendo decided to not let the player experiment, not even an inch, which is extremely sad and counteractive to what the game is supposed to be. Moving on, it's also strange that there barely are any new enemies in the game, and a lot of the requested ones like firebros and Porkupuffers are locked behind 3D World for some bizarre reason. The world maker, which was added in one of the content updates, feels very restricted as well and is limited to the Super Mario World style. We can go on and on with the game's unnecessary limitations. All these constraints combine to create an experience that feels unnecessarily restrictive. Instead of being a playground for creativity, the game ends up feeling far too constrained and underwhelming.",3,10
metacritic,donki222,super-mario-maker-2,"Sadly the game's many unnecessary limitations bring it down quite harshly.  There's no way to mix level themes with liquids as they're locked in their respective 2 themes. So no lava underground, water castle, poison desert, lava sky, etc. The night themes all have the same exact background except the airship, and they all have similar tinny music, overall making them very unattractive to use. No infinite timer, only 1 subarea, only 4 doors per area, areas are still too small and short in scale, there's no way to draw semisolid tiles individually, there are barely any new enemies even after the 2 updates, world maker is very limited and only includes one style, a lot of the course parts feel uncannily rudimentary like the skewers, angry sun, twisters, 3D world is separate and even more limited than the other game styles, etc. The game even removes some of the course parts placing freedom from the first game. You can no longer place things in the starting area, a lot of objects can no longer overlap, a lot of quirks with some of the mechanics are completely removed, etc. It’s extremely difficult to find good levels in the online section, most is just hot garbage, “refreshing” levels or speed runs. Overall the game feels too limited, and this only hurts the game. Level editors shouldn't have such a giant pool of restrictions as it completely hurts experimentation and creativity.",1,10

metacritic,Retrobert,super-mario-maker-2,"With the success of the first Mario Maker, a sequel was highly anticipated—and Super Mario Maker 2 definitely delivers. This installment brings back everything you loved from the first game, plus a whole lot more. One of the standout features is the added Story Mode, which is a pleasant surprise for players who aren’t as interested in user-created levels due to the inconsistent quality. Thankfully, Nintendo provides a variety of expertly crafted levels, making for an enjoyable and well-rounded experience. The inclusion of new power-ups, like the 8-bit Link, feels surprisingly natural and fits seamlessly into the Mario universe.However, the game isn’t without its flaws. Multiplayer mode can sometimes be nearly unplayable due to lag, which is a major disappointment. Endless Mode is a great concept, but the quality of levels is hit-or-miss, and more often than not, you end up with lackluster creations. If Nintendo curated this mode to feature levels based on completion percentages, it would be a significant improvement. The game also includes several suits and unlockables for your avatar, adding an achievement system that works well. For instance, you can unlock items by clearing 100 courses on normal difficulty or by winning three consecutive matches in Versus mode. While the core gameplay remains the classic Mario we all know and love, the level design possibilities and creativity in this game are limitless. Overall, Nintendo knocked it out of the park with Super Mario Maker 2.",9,10

metacritic,MetalMariofan64,super-mario-maker-2,Story is ok. Creativity is not bad. I can take inspiration for creating videogames. This is a good example for a game developer!,7,10
metacritic,UrbanOtaku,super-mario-maker-2,"The amount of creativity this game births, conceives, adopts, [other synonyms for 'create'] is unmatched, and it comes with a bow on top; that bow being the mustachioed man himself.

Mario Maker 1 was already a great sandbox game, so adding more items and gimmicks to it was the logical next step, and that step took them to the land of gold.
The addition of extra background themes was a great step, and it gives levels more flair. In MM1 the level themes were fine, but the lack of diversity just made levels feel like ""platform challenges or cool tech showcases"" rather than graspable places Mario would visit. Now, who knows where your level could be? A jungle full of acid, a windy desert, high in the clouds? The list isn't infinite, but the new options feel so welcome.

But that's all cosmetically; howis the gameplay?
As many people have quoted throughout the history of our species: ""fun"".

The new items feel ""spicy"" enough to justify its difference from it's Wii U father, yet tend to stay calm enough as to not overwhelm the maker or players with complicated items.

Slopes feel so good in levels and HEAVILY alleviate the problem with the New SMB style in MM1; you can make fresh hills rather than blocky awkward steps.

The addition of Swinging Claws has given creators a new tool for platforming, as you can suspend enemies and items in the air and make them fall if you walk under one; Spinies are my go to option to put on the claws in a platformer.
While it was an update item in ver. 2.0, it's hard to imagine this game without Spike Balls. They follow real laws of gravity, so you can have fun making hilly levels that take advantage of the ball slowing down and speeding up on slopes.
Twisters and Snake Blocks, albeit underwhelming when the public first saw them, are cute obstacles and feel like a natural and justified inclusion in this game despite their few uses.
Fish Bones are a unique enemy introduced; on land, at least. They'll be destroyed if they touch literally anything, yet can still harm the player. To take advantage of this unique property, I like to put them on parachutes.
And lastly,the ON/OFF Switch. Wow, this is impressive. So much uses have been seen for it; a jump sensor, a way to make rhythm game levels, kaizo platforming... it's such a perfect fit for the game and fits the spirit of the game like a glove.

The courses you find online are very polar; they're either extravagant or awful, if you found an inbetween, then wow good for you. You tend to get recommended a certain ratio of recent uploads/at least 1 heart given, and it works okay. 
The ONE SOLE issue I have with viewing online courses, as well as this game as a whole, is that like YouTube you can ""Boo"" or dislike a course, but no one will see that Boo. Being able to see a Boo to Yeah ratio would have been so good for level browsing and would've made you aware of bad levels way faster.

Other than that one gripe, this game is phenomenal; and again, so much creativity has blossomed from it. People have made entire 2-digit calculators in this game, that's impressive.

So what are you waiting for? Let's-a go get making!",9,10

The ability to build Mario levels and worlds using a plethora of tools provided by Nintendo themselves is a great idea, however, there are some disappointing things in this game. The tools provided are good but a lot of things are missing. Anything that's off screen doesn't load properly, leading to level creators having to do workarounds. I wish Nintendo provided better support in that area. Another thing that's weird is the 3D World theme. It just feels unnecessary because it's missing a lot of cool things from 3D World and has some bizarre things such as the car. Now, onto the things I like. I love seeing the older Mario themes in widescreen. It just feels awesome to see Super Mario World in such a format. Another thing I love is the Super Worlds. People can build their own worlds, complete with custom overworld maps. I just think that's neat. Overall, Mario Maker 2 is a good, but flawed game that strives to create a fun creative tool for budding level designers and brand new stages for people that are looking for that next Mario fix.",7,10
metacritic,ND-Bringer,super-mario-maker-2,"The ultimate Super Mario Bros level maker is now available on the go! I swear the only reason I didn't play it at first was because I lacked the inspiration to create new levels. Back on the Wii U, players weren't allowed to simply have all the building items in arms reach. Players had to wait nine real life days in order to unlock these items. So if you wanted to build the level of your dreams, you would have to play a game of back and forth with the date and time settings. But now, ultimate power is now at your fingertips! Though I personally prefer not to use the touch screen on my Switch.

I'd say the best addition of this game is the world map maker, currently it's only limited to having Super Mario World theming. But the fact that I have the ability to place alive icons, alternate routes, toad houses to go with my stages it takes me back to the days of my childhood, drawing my own Mario levels for fun. Their's even a solo mode if you want to search for inspiration and challenge Nintendo staff levels. Life is good!

One of the most important elements of video game design is freedom. The more options you give your players, the more enjoyable the game becomes. So this sequel is a big step in the right direction. However I will say the best way to enjoy this game, is to have other people try out your levels. Whether they be local or online, the true joy that comes from creating levels is seeing the people enjoy themselves while playing them.",8,10

Un sous-genre du Metroidvania, mais là où il se démarque, c'est par la manière de bloquer un joueur. Non pas forcément par le manque d'un item ou pouvoir mais par le manque de connaissances. On peut citer comme exemple de ce genre de jeu, Outer wilds, Fez ou encore Tunic. On dit d'ailleurs de Tunic que c'est un jeu qui en cache un deuxième. Et bien dans Animal Well, on peut presque parler de 4 jeux en un. J'ai longuement hésité à lui attribuer un 10/10, notamment grâce à la richesse de secrets que regorge le jeu. Mais les résultats des secrets n'ont pas le même effet de claque/choc que peuvent le faire ceux d'outer wilds. Et les secrets d'Animal Well sont parfois ""absurdes"" et relèvent de la fouille millimétrée de la map. Rendant pour moi la note à 9/10 (Ce qui est fantastique).

Sometimes the backtracking was a real chore but not too time consuming as traversal is rather quick. The game design was well done with interesting puzzles and platforming involved. Almost the entire game has no music at all; not sure if this is a good thing but I would have preferred some sort of ambient BGM. I liked the dark, creepy atmosphere. The developers were probably trying to be innovative, but I still think the game would have been more interesting with some combat, bosses and music. My play through was 10.5 hours so it's not a big game but that's perfectly fine.

metacritic,piglordofallham,animal-well,"Appearance of depth is sometimes conflated with complexity, or more aptly, conflated with quality, since the longevity of a product is often on the line in terms of relevancy and shares some of that longevity with overall sales.  So its easy to make the argument that, ""As long as people are talking about it- its probably gonna sell.""  This doesn't work for every product on the market, but for Videogames (in particular no-name publishers or creators or small-time Indie studios) this word-of-mouth advertising is absolutely integral to their products success.  Which brings us to: ""Animal Well.""

Animal well is a small indie game made by a small team about a seemingly small world with a moderate amount of platforming mixed with an absolutely absurd amount of puzzles, some so cryptic that its not surprising if you never even knew they existed (a point I will come back to).  Though often thrown into the ""metroid-vania"" vein, I would disagree with that genre label entirely, this is more ""Fantasy World Dizzy"" meets the ""Kings Quest"" series, even down to the main sprite consisting of a small bean running on tiny little feet.  Adorable as this may be, it is a perplexing design given every other NPC or creature you run into is an actual animal (done with sprite work of course).  Unfortunately (or fortunately) Metroid never had any instances of failing a tiny jump or a series of switches meant to hit in a specific order in a specific series or with specific progression items only to outright respawn you at your local Telephone save game room.  So I safely say that just because its ""2D"" and has a large interconnected map or a warp room, doesn't make it a Metroid clone of any kind.

I would in fact like to draw players to the fact that maybe.. just maybe- Animal Well is actually its own thing.  For once, I would imagine people would agree, especially if they were just as confounded by some of the post-game surprises as I was.  Not only does Animal Well feature two (three?) Credit roll fake-outs, but it is also has some of the most esoteric, mysterious and downright ""how-could-anyone-have-figured-this-out"" secrets in a Videogame in recent memory.  There are clues on walls, behind walls, in rooms, in the shape of rooms, only accessible with items, most are literal easter eggs to collect, some are animals to set loose, some are animals so spook, some are bosses, some aren't, then you have actual secrets buried behind those secrets that took a team of people over 2 weeks to find and even then.. they still haven't actually found everything.  So absolutely flabberghasted by the rate at which people found secrets, Billy Basso (one of the creators) was ostensibly in shock, so much so that he actually had hidden a recording of himself for players who found some of his most hidden work in the game itself.

Of course, all of this aside, I don't think Animal Well quite deserves a lot of its (at times) ridiculous and overzealous praise.  For one, many of the puzzles are extremely rudimentary ""trial-and-error"" escape room challenges.  The other massive issue I had is that after solving many of these challenges, you are forced (if you want to see more content) to traipse back through.. every room.  This can sometimes involve re-doing puzzle challenges, even if you've unlocked portions of rooms that were already solved or warp areas to go back to, you are still reduced to going back through every nook and cranny just to find things you missed.  Billy, I don't care how many secrets you have in your game, I should not have to solve a complex algorithm of numbers and memorize movement patterns just to gain the ability to move around everywhere without having to toggle through 12 different items just to get around a room I've been to twenty separate times.  That's ridiculous.

The item swapping is asinine and tends to take up more of your time then necessary when most games have already solved having multiple abilities with item wheels or simplified mapping to various buttons.  Your basic jumping arc is difficult to gauge maybe, and I'm being generous, here 40% of the time.  Which makes it unreliable and finicky, as you often seem to be close enough to what you're jumping to, but won't always quite make it.  I also felt like the movement was rather slippery and imprecise.  Frisbee riding multiple times is totally possible- its just an absolute pain.  I also tore my actual hair out trying to properly play the flute, since I found it weirdly picky about what was being input from 8-directions whenever I used it for some puzzles.  All the amazing, mind-blowing stuff is buried beneath layers of what ""could"" have been a very good, tight three to four hour action plat-former with some cool puzzles sprinkled in.  However, the excessive mind-numbing, bizarre and very impractical advanced puzzle solutions would challenge Bill Gates, much less a team of Bill Gates clones working around the clock.  As clever as it is, its wasting your time in the end.",7,10

Animal Well is the type of game that begs you to achieve 100% completion. Secrets and puzzles are perfectly laid out, always rewarding your curiosity in any direction you go. The strange creatures you cross paths with on your adventure give the world such a unique feel, always getting you to wonder just what led this place to be the way it is.

metacritic,tanitar,animal-well,"By far the best metroidvania I've ever played, better than SOTN, Hollow Knight ,and Super metroid to name a few. The pure sense of exploration, puzzle solving and uneasiness give the game an atmosphere that blows a majority of games I have played out of the water. The way the items and world weave together and the plentiful secrets make this game a mile wide and a mile deep. My only complaint was that the game took only 13 hours unguided to complete gathering all eggs and all major items. Although that might be for the better since the game does a good job of being a complete package and I don't know how they could have continued it past the other deeper secrets in the game.",10,10
metacritic,srf5132,animal-well,"Animal Well is a competent metroidvania that overstays its welcome and relies too heavily on cryptic puzzles for my taste, especially in the ""end game"".

The game starts out as a pretty standard metroidvania.  You wander around, find items that make it possible to explore more areas, rinse and repeat.  This section is genuinely quite fun.  The items are quite novel, and there were many interesting combinations of uses to find.  During this phase of the game you will find a number of secret ""eggs"", which are the games main collectible.  In true metroidvania fashion, many of these eggs will not be possible to get until you unlock more movement items, requiring you to backtrack to the item.  This backtracking is par for the course for metroidvania fans, but it is more annoying than usual in this game for a couple of reasons.  First, the movement of your character and the environment is very slow, even fully upgraded, making backtracking a sludge.  Second, some items are locked behind finishing the game the first time, making for a lot of frustrating moments, where I couldn't understand how to get some item, only to look it up out of frustration, realizing that I needed to finish the game first.  This is contrary to usual metroidvania logic, where you are compelled to finish whatever you want to before entering the final area, so it would've been nice if this change was communicated more clearly.

After the first ending is when the game gets decidedly more annoying.  The new items you get from beating the game require you to effectively go through every single room in the game again to find all of the ""eggs"".  I personally found many of these to be very hard to find, and often come down to missing one tile on the screen or, very often, using the flute in the room.  You _could_ certainly do all of this without looking up a guide, but be prepared to go into every room and use every item in it in every conceivable location, because otherwise you almost certainly will miss things.  This section was annoying and I lost my enjoyment of the game at this stage.   I think that all in all the first part of the game, with maybe half as many eggs would've been about the right length for me.

Once you've finished the egg collectathon, strap in, because now there's a whole other tier of secrets to find.  ""Bunnies"".  This is where the game goes from puzzles that are frustrating and boring to ones that are so cryptic they are essentially only possible with help from the internet.  I don't like these sorts of things in games because they drive artificial hype from people finding things out on the internet and sharing ideas, but actually solving the puzzle doesn't feel very rewarding, since for almost all of them you aren't actually able to solve it yourself.   Now, this wouldn't be so bad on its own, but those super puzzles bleed into the rest of the game so that I ended up spending a lot of time trying to solve these cryptic super puzzles, only to realize that they were not really meant to be solvable and weren't for the eggs  I was now in the business of collecting.

So, on a whole, there is a decent metroidvania here, but I would recommend just putting it down after the first set of credits, as everything that comes after that is just too frustrating and tedious to enjoy.",6,10
metacritic,Peaceduke,animal-well,Absolutely masterfully crafted mysterious puzzle metroidvania. Surprise hit if the year and the best game so far. What a treat for Metroidvania fans!,9,10
metacritic,RealityShock,animal-well,"If you're some miserable basic gamer who only enjoys playing CoD then this game will not be for you. There was a lot of hype for this game based on Dunkey promoting it with videos so inevitably, people who don't enjoy this kind of game are going to buy it not knowing what they're getting into.

The game is great, it's a fun metroid-vania-like game with lots of puzzles but it's not a hand-holding game so it you don't have the brain or patience to figure things out for yourself then this will likely just frustrate you enough to leave a bad review.

There are multiply layers to this game - the first level which gets you to the first ending will take 5-7 hours, the second level could take considerably longer depending on how much you try to solve yourself. The third layer is/was a community effort and would not have been solvable on your own, just lending to the amount of secrets and hidden things in this game. 

I wouldn't call this a 10/10 game, likely the people who are were involved in the initial solving of the third level and those kind of experiences can't really be replicated once they're found. The game has nice ambient music, classic/retro feel with 8-bit graphics and well-thought out puzzles. The number of times I tried to exploit some of the mechanics of the items you have only to find that the developer had accounted for that made me laugh. It's obvious that this was a labor of love. That being said, there's no combat like one would expect in a classic metroid-vania and while it did not need it to be a fun and engaging game, it's hard not to compare it to games like Hollow Knight or Classic Metroid and Castlevania titles.

As far as graphics go, there are few 2D Pixel games like this. Every enemy just pops out of the screen and is so visible. The beautiful environments with beautiful lighting, all in 2D pixels btw, are so mesmerizing and never get old throughout the game. There is a decent variety of different environments, all with their own tile sets, lighting, and atmosphere. The enemies and animals you find always seem to match where you are.
There are a good amount of secrets in the game, but you will probably need a guide if you want to find some of them (the medals, and what to do with them as an example). 

Now a game could have great graphics and a large amount of bonus content and still be ass. This isn't that. Each puzzle feels fresh, and the more tools you get, the more ways you can solve it. Some tools feel like outright cheating at certain points. As many have pointed out, there is no combat, at all. The tools you get are solely utility. However, the boss fights still feel pretty organic and are fun (even though some are short). Everything in this game was fostered with a creativity that 99% of triple-A studios can't get right.

Animal Well is a short game. I beat it in one day, after completely exploring every panel on the map. It keeps itself in check and doesn't drag out tedious puzzles longer than they have to be. It's also not oversaturated to the point you get bored. In my opinion, it's the perfect length for a game like this.

Played some League, some AOE2, but mostly chess.

This game is such a disappointment. I do not see what every body is excited about. Honestly.

I play this game on keyboard, and it is abysmal. Not beeing able to adjust the settings yourself, is such a weak slip up. I would have guessed that Dunkey would be the first one to point it out.
So I jump with space, use arrow keys for controlls. Have x,c,v,z and 1, 3 for adjusting stuff, and as I have not an english keyboard, I use y for z. It ****. It really does. 

The puzzles are incredibly easy. The art style is beautiful, but I feel everybody is like ""It is 8-bit graphics, so it must be a work of art"". Like come on, besides some nice graphics (the fireworks for example) this game does not even look THAT good. Everything looks the same.

And everything in this game takes so god damn long. Again, listening to dunkey **** on games for so long, I thought that this must be the greatest game ever made or something like that.

Everything is easy, to a point where it feels like making it hard is just resetting you a bunch of times so you have to do it again.

I was wondering why there was a small subset of people up in arms about this game online, but after finishing it the reason became painfully clear: some people find it too hard and/or mentally taxing and rather than just saying it’s not for them, with its old-school design sensibilities and opaqueness (which would be totally fine), they instead pretend it’s a poorly-designed game. Typical. Go back to your “AAA” slop and those of us who appreciate real art and genuine innovation in game design will keep playing, and replaying, Animal Well.

And to think this was all made by essentially just one dude. He should be immensely proud.",10,10
metacritic,MarManarnar,animal-well,"Game is definitely not worth 25$, grab it for 10$ if you can.  ~ 7 hours to reach credits, and then it becomes some cryptic bs in an attempt to artificially expand game time. It's simply lacking a lot of content for it to be anywhere near the league of hollow knight, cult of the lamb, Neon White, Dave the Diver, etc... (i.e other games in that price range).

It makes me feel how Dunkey did when he first played Death Stranding, except I'm not going back to play it 3 times.

Also, Destructoid, God is a Geek, etc... You all are essentially virgin sex workers giving this game a 10/10. Now I know if I ever see your reviews again, to ignore them.",6,10

metacritic,Foudelavie,animal-well,"I've just finished it.This indie game is a Metroidvania/Puzzle, where you're pretty free in the way you approach the puzzles.

Animal well lives up to its name, with lots of different animals and no dialogue. 
And the atmosphere is very singular, with both laughter and occasional ****'s a game where you have to figure out for yourself how to get through the challenges. 
Sometimes you feel lost in the strangeness of this world.I'm not a pro-gamer, it's not that easy for me at first, but if I've finished it, you can do it.

The graphics are beautiful and detailed, and the game's physics are great fun. 
The immersion with the ambient sound is **** me, this is the independent game of the year, and a little gem, especially as I could see that it was created by a single person, which is impressive.

metacritic,gamereviewer42,animal-well,"I love Metroidvanias, but even I can get tired of the genre at times. All Metroidvanias feature the repetitive ""get an ability to improve the way your character moves to places you couldn't before"" cycle, including this one. It's not that cycle that I have a problem with, but the fact that almost every single Metroidvania in recent memory has executed it the exact same way, except this one. In Animal Well, new items are spread few and far between, but given immense power that make them useful in situations not immediately obvious. 

Traversing in Animal Well isn't: ""Oh, a double jump, that'll help me get to that place that was too far to get to before!""
It's: ""Oh... a frisbee...? I mean... dogs love frisbees, maybe I can distract that dog by playing fetch,""  and then 20 minutes later, ""d- does this frisbee work in clearing out these icicles too?!""

metacritic,ZroZ,miside,"MiSide(2024)

СЮЖЕТ: Простенький, но со вкусом. Игра цепляет скорее не сюжетом, а количеством отсылок на массовую культуру, персонажами и пасхалками. Разработчик очень хорошо разбирается в кино и аниме, потому что отсылок на разные штуки я видел регулярно. Персонажи цепляют с первых секунд и с ними хочется остаться на подольше, думаю во многом из-за этого, каждый второй игрок открыл мирный режим(НА 21.01.25 ОН НЕ ДОСТУПЕН(когда режим выйдет, я дополню рецензию)). Сюжет же является полуфоновым и не сильно тебя напрягает и грузит, просто двигаешься по течению и кайфуешь.

ГЕЙМПЛЕЙ: Супер просто и фоново. Максимум что от тебя потребует игра, это тыкать и водить мышкой. Геймплей простой, но он и не должен быть сложным. Так же при том что игра не требует от тебя ничего, кроме базовых навыков пользования компьютером, она умудряется всячески разноображивать коротенькую сюжетку, различными мини-играми, прикольчиками и т.д.

ВИЗУАЛ и МУЗЫКА: Миленько. Визуал очень добренький и умеренно анимешный. Игра так же пытается в хоррор, однако напугать она может только прям супер пугливых(как я ;P). Тем не мене даже я скажу, что визуал хоррор-части просто нормальный или даже скорее слабоватый. С другой стороны, хоррор сегментов раз, два и обчелся, так что это не это вообще не влияет на впечатление от игры. Что касается музыки, то тут минусов... нет? Музыка отлично подходит к тому, что происходит на экране. Говоря про MiSide, не стоит забывать об озвучке, которых две: японская и русская. Все очень хвалят японскую, ведь там позвали настоящего актера озвучки аниме, но я не пробовал и сказать не могу. Я буду хвалить русскую озвучку, которую, да озвучивал фандаб, ну и что? Получилось отлично! Кепочка, Мила, Мита, гг и т.д, звучат по разному, живо и ты в них веришь. Да, конечно, все таки местами, чувствуется немного фальша, но обычно только в смехе персонажей, а так очень даже хорошо. Короче говоря, руки я целовал звукорежиссёру.

ХОРРОР: Вообще не хоррор. Да, меня игра напугала, но при этом я практически не играю в хорроры, да и по природе своей очень пугливый. Человека, который поиграл хотя бы в 10-ку хорроров, игра не напугает вообще. Да и она как будто бы не сильно то и старается. Супер милота и добренько. 

ТЕХНИЧЕСКАЯ ЧАСТЬ: Игра отлично работает, хотя кое-где бывает баги некретичные. С другой стороны, зная как часто игра ломает четвертую стену и заигрывает с темой багов, то я не уверен в том, что это баги, а не намеренные приколы от разрабов.

ИТОГ: Не ожидал ничего, но бесконечные мемы по игре и друзья заинтриговали. В итоге на новый год мне таки подарили игруху и я моментально ее прошел. На одном дыхании без остановки. Игра короткая и супер затягивает. Да, есть недостатки, но игра такая добрая и уютная, что в ней хочется остаться на подольше. Жду с нетерпением мирного режима и советую игру вам!

1. The main character is incredibly stupid. But if in stories about yanderes all the main characters were smart, then there would be no yanderes, there would only be sweet buns, right?

To begin with, I want to tell you about the main story. It's really simple and predictable, but not bad. All I can say is that you will not be surprised by the end.

Now, I want to compare this game to Undertale and BATIM (aka Bendy and the Ink Machine).I was honestly surprised that the authors took the idea of nicknames from Undertale. It was really fun to watch Mita's comments on names and guess if she'd say something new about them.

The counter of Easter eggs was broken. No, really, they are countless, just like in the two games I mentioned above. With photo mode, it's especially interesting to find the hidden things the authors included, which you can't see during a normal playthrough.

In this game, you will find 9 or 10 mini-games, all in different styles and genres.

metacritic,otakuine,miside,"Let's start by discussing the story of the game. Early on, there are moments that can truly surprise the player. These emotional turns really make you reflect on your choices. As the game progresses, the story and character development continue to impress. You really feel immersed in the experience, playing as a character who is uncertain of what to do in this unfamiliar world. As the story unfolds, new characters are introduced, adding depth and complexity to the **** horror elements are also notable. While there aren't many terrifying moments, those that are present are very effective. Even as someone who isn’t particularly a fan of horror, I found myself able to enjoy the atmosphere and relax while **** sound design is outstanding: the voice acting is of the highest quality, with actors perfectly suited to their roles. The music does an excellent job of building tension at the right moments, though occasionally it hints that something intense is about to **** graphics are exactly what you’d expect from a game of this genre. They fit perfectly with the overall atmosphere and are visually appealing. Additionally, the developers are actively expanding the game, with new modes like the ""Everyday life"" mode currently in **** sum up, this game definitely deserves the attention it’s receiving. The price is also well-suited, but personally, I would have liked a bit more gameplay. 3 to 3.5 hours feels a little short, but considering the upcoming updates, new costumes, and new modes, this is something I can overlook.

I was curious to see all of the Mila's and what would they offer to the players.

Even the story is really interesting and prevents you from quitting the game. I played like 5-6 hours and completed the story. Only got like 10~ archivments, so I'm gonna go back. You are able to replay and find secrets for new outfits or storylogs. I even unlocked a special gamemode that tells me they gonna implement a total different game into this quite soon.

metacritic,GolFin,miside,"Узнал об этой игре после форса в Тик Токе а уже позже решил скачать и пройти ее. Ранее я ни разу не играл в игры где тот или иной персонаж может ломать 4 стену а потому это был мой первый опыт в этом ""жанре"". Сразу могу дать игре 1 балл за русскую озвучку (что в нынешних реалиях редкость). Начинается игра с того что ГГ качает файл с игрой который прислал ему его друг. Сама концепция игры представляет из себя что то типо тамагочи где нужно помогать внутри игровому персонажу в домашних делах (по типу собери то и отнеси туда). С самого начала игры нам дают прям жирный намек на то что с главным персонажем этой игры что то не так и это сильно подогревает интерес к ней (момент с бензопилой в духовке). Конечно я мог бы пересказать весь сюжет игры но лучше расскажу какие эмоции мне дала игра за все время прохождения. Прошел ее я за 4,5 часа но мне уже этого было достаточно дабы прихуеть со всей игры. Игра вызывает слишком много разных эмоций за короткий промежуток (от шока с сюжетных поворотов и радостных новостей до страха и грусти) что для такой простой игры ну прям до жути круто. Персонажи в этой игре не пустышки а вполне достойные личности со своими проблемами которых ты понимаешь и сочувствуешь им (что уж стоит та же Мита без лица которая стала такой только из-за злой Миты или Мила которую потом убьет та же злая Мита). Так же куда и без позитивных эмоций. Мне сильно зашли мини игры с Кепочкой (и конечно же шутка насчет ее вибратора) а также фикс глитчей в домике у Милы (за момент с душем также даю жирный плюс). Так же мотивацию злой Миты в принципе +- понять можно (хоть ее я и не разделяю). Единственная проблема в игре на мой взгляд - это то что она не страшная. Да я понимаю что это ИМХО но меня она никак не пугала от слова совсем (ну может быть кроме 2-3 случаев). На последок хочу опять таки затронуть те эмоций которые передает игра. Ты и вправду получаешь искрение эмоции от каждого этапа игры и неважно какой он добрый или нет. Я очень сильно желаю чтобы проект не закончился на 1 игре и дабы в будущем вышел сиквел к этой игре который продолжает историю 1 игры. Каждому человеку который читает этот отзыв рекомендую пройти эту игру (учитывая то что она проходится за 3-4 часа то на это можно найти время).",8,10
metacritic,fedyacpp,miside,"While this game isn't bad, it seems the developers aimed to blend three distinct genres: visual novels akin to Doki Doki Literature Club, escape-focused horror games like Outlast, and 3d anime-style titles. Unfortunately, in my view, the execution falls short in several key areas. The game lacks genuinely unsettling moments, essential survival escape mechanics, and the eerie visuals that are crucial for a compelling horror experience. Moreover, the gameplay feels unnecessarily prolonged due to the absence of a sprint feature, resulting in sluggish pacing that becomes particularly tedious during second and subsequent playthroughs.

Despite these drawbacks, the game still has merit and is worth exploring. However, for me, it remains an average experience rather than something truly exceptional. If you're curious, give it a try, but keep your expectations in check regarding its horror and survival aspects.",8,10

Es increíble que para citar algo de este juego nunca vas a escoger la mejor frase, un juego maravilloso desde el arte a la narrativa, los personajes, la construcción de tu personaje que cambiara totalmente la experiencia y de lo mas importante, no puedes cambiar el pasado de tu personaje, y por ello tu presente esta muy condicionado, pero tu futuro y el de los que te rodean cambiara en base a tus aciertos y tus fallos.
Otra cosa que quiero mencionar es que este juego es de los pocos que a logrado que NO quiera explorar una opción, no quiero saber que pasa si hago eso porque se que el jeugo puede hacer cualquier cosa, en resumen, un jeugo que por desgracia dudo que se repita.",10,10

metacritic,criticaldude,disco-elysium,"Almost 50 hours of playtime, in which 90% (or potentially more) of gameplay is basically just dialogue. If it sounds boring or you just don't like reading (though there is voice acting) i'd still strongly suggest giving it a shot. The writing in this game is beyond impressive. Close to perfection. A masterpiece which is best to explore as blindly as possible. If you are planning to play it anyway, dont look up anything,experience it yourself. 
Its baffling to me how captivating the story is and how the ""gameplay"" just flows. Multiple times during the first playthrough i found myself sitting there for hours basically just talking to people. An entire dialogue can take up to 20-30 minutes even and at the end of each conversation it leaves you with clue or an idea which you wanna find out more about. If you're up for an epic, incredibly humorous, adventure in this detective role playing game with incredible storytelling, characters, worldbuilding, soundtrack and art direction i beg you, at the very least, give it a try.",10,10

metacritic,gfloresca,disco-elysium,"If you're the type who likes to read to a lot of text heavy dialogue and listen to voice narratives, then this game is right up your alley. Be forewarned that Disco Elysium is not for everyone. It's a story-driven and text-heavy game that's filled with ultra-left and ultra-right wing socialist philosophies and political jargon. But regardless of your ideologies, you should have a fun time deciding where your character leans on the spectrum. Each day in the game runs on real-world time depending on the tasks you do. You'll often find yourself reading a lot of ncp dialogue and then choosing the best responses. Different aspects of your character's mind and personality will also intervene and converse with you. The dialogue choices you make will largely impact the pacing, progression, and future consequences, in the game. Some of the dialogue will require skill checks (e.g., logic, persuasion, strength). And passing those checks will give you an edge in your detective work. The more upgrade points you put into a specific skill, the better your chances at each dice roll. Again, this game is a hit or miss. Although I personally enjoy story-driven narratives where I get to read a lot and choose the responses that fit my moral compass, there was just TOO MUCH to read and not much to explore. Talking to npcs felt like reading a chapter of a textbook. I often found myself skipping some of the socio-political, economic, and racial dialogue that was presented. Some of the terms, concepts, and ideas were simply too complicated to understand for someone with no background in far-right and far-left socio-economic ideas. Though I enjoyed reading about this fictional world, I skipped many dialogue passages that seemed like they were taken straight out of a Marxist textbook. You read a lot about these places and people, but you never really go there. The game tries to build the world around you through text and voice narrative. And that can seem boring if you're only limited to exploring one small area within that world. So you never get to really reinforce that information in your head. Overall, I think the game deserves merit for its compelling story and in-depth world building.",7,10

Brain gum for pseudo-intellectuals. Moreover, this is not an RPG. This is one long drawn out quest. Like one from Skyrim where you have to track down a maniac in Windhelm, you know =) And there is absolutely no RPG component here. You can't create a character. And even the characteristics don’t affect anything (otherwise why are the “stupid” character’s lines NOT different from the other 2 branches? You can’t choose normal options in dialogues, because they simply don’t exist, and those that exist don’t affect anything (try not to wake up in the first dialogue, for example). But there will be a bunch of texts about what to do with material things. WHAT IS THIS, A TEXT SIMS??? The characters are worthless, there is literally no empathy for anyone, because they are just only cardboards - decorations for the riots and tomfoolery of the main character. By the way, the humor here is also bad. The level of marginal drunks. The setting is certainly unusual, but damn, even in The Wolf Among Us there are more plot RPG elements.

The objects to interact with, the characters to talk to, the place to explore are overwhelming, maybe, sometimes, in a little tiresome way. Despite this, Disco Elysium remains a unique experience, entirely based on what you are, as a person and as real human being, because, in front of this story of despairing hope, all of us react in a different manner.",8,10
metacritic,PenetratorGod,disco-elysium,"I played the game and it was definitely one of the worst and boring games I've ever seen and I deleted it. It's not a game, it's more like an e-book.

First of all, this is not an open world game. I have no idea how it can be marketed like this, have the makers ever seen an open world game? The NPCs do nothing but sleep at night and the world is a small and frankly empty map. It's static and dead and never changes. It's not even a world, let alone an open world.

It's not a real RPG either. Yes, you have stats and inventory and dice rolls, but that's it. Also, these are just game mechanics, there's a skill tree and inventory like in a lot of games, but they don't make a game an RPG game, and there's no real choice, because the whole difference is tied to dialog options, which you'll click on anyway, further destroying the role-playing part, and for a lot of things, choosing to do something will actually be a dice roll, and the mechanics of retrying the roll are overly complicated and too overwhelming to take the time.

No matter what you do, you'll be dragged towards a single ending, which makes sense since it's a murder mystery, but as a player you have no choice, the only real choice is at the character creation screen, and from that point on it's pretty much set how you're going to play the next 30-40 hours of the game, which is filled with dialog just to drag it out.

Yes, you can click on options in dialog windows, but the game will decide for you whether that happens or not, and it will mostly depend on your character's stats and some modifiers. Yes, again, it's an RPG mechanic, but as a player, you don't really get to choose anything or do anything.

An example **** where your choices really matter would be Detroit Become Human. Or even Witcher 3. Disco Elysium is nowhere near that level, Detroit is already not an RPG game, Witcher 3 is not a pure RPG, but supposedly Disco Elysium was marketed as open world and a pure RPG, but it's not even half as successful as those games.

In short, Disco Elysium is not a game to be played even if it's free. I never understood what they liked about this game. It is one of the most overrated games of recent years.",4,10

it's a masterclass way of telling a story and specifically the story of this character.

The voice-acting is amazing. every feeling, every thought is voiced and has its own personality. it's amazingly done. the music accompanies you with beautiful and haunting melodies throughout and it is etched in my mind alongside some of the voices I heard during my playthrough.

The writing is clearly the star of the show, the vivid imagery and attention to detail make you feel like youre in war-torn Revachol. Every last character has depth and plays an important role in the story. I felt like a kid in a candy store watching the brilliant story unfold and tie in events that I once thought insignificant. No matter where you go or who you talk to in Revachol, whether it be the fishing village, the harbor, or the whirl-in-rags, you can feel the tension and the toll the revolution has taken. The pacing is also amazing; despite the game taking place on a relatively small map, new sections or characters are introduced at just the right times. I also loved how the dialogue checks were based on probability, so no matter what you decided to put your skill points in to you always had a chance of succeeding.

metacritic,srx,slime-rancher,9 stars. Good 20 or so hours of exploration and discovery. Lots of customization and upgrades make the game so much more satisfying than it already is. Feeding blobs and selling their excrement has never been more appealing.,9,10
metacritic,MrPerson,slime-rancher,"Slime Rancher is one of my all time favorite games.  It combines a good sense of adventure, wonder, and exploration.  A very well made farming simulator.  A simple and sweet story.  Tons of interesting things to do.  All with a very cute and visually pleasing art style.  There are multiple different game play loops that are all interesting or fun on their own right.
Exploration is very fun, Each area has its own hub of sorts, and some places more hidden and out of the way.  The problem with them is that most hidden areas usually don't have anything if you get to them, but honestly exploring and finding these places is fun enough that I don't need an award.  If anything, to me personally, I prefer that there isn't anything in hard to get to places, because it feels less like I discovered something I was supposed to find, and more like I stumbled upon this little place outside the game, its rewarding in it's own right.  Anyway, the farther out you go, the more difficult the slimes are to manage, in the first area, the most difficult slime is Rock, because it damages you a bit.  By the last area, slimes can cause tornadoes and fiery explosions.  Having to adapt to the chaos of the slimes is fun.
The story is really nice as well.  It's told mostly in messages strewn about the world, and letters you receive, so you don't need to know the story if you don't want to, but I'd recommend looking into it.  It's nothing complicated, just a simple love story with the message of settling down, but I like that it isn't complicated.  It's simple and sweet, just like the rest of the game, so it fits very well.  The game has a perfect mix of not telling you what to do, without actually leaving you in the dark too much (unless you're like that one reviewer, Mandulum, who didn't know how to unlock the doors to the other areas).
The visuals are great, the colors are nice, and all of the slimes are adorable(, my personal favorite is the Crystal Slime).  Farming is good, you make money off of feeding your slimes, and the more difficult the slime, the more profitable it is to do so.  So you can buy upgrades to your farm to make it easier to deal with slimes as the slimes get more chaotic.  It's balanced fairly well so its never too easy nor too hard to keep your farm in check.  A problem you could think of when looking at the world map is that it's too small, but realistically you can't leave your farm for more than 2 days at a time, because slimes get more chaotic the more hungry they are, so you won't be able to explore everything for a while.  This serves to keep you more interested in the world, as forward progress is generally small.  You could play the game without farming at all, but there are various upgrades you can give yourself with money that you'd then miss.  Such as more inventory, faster movement, more health, more energy, and a jetpack!  The farming never feels like its keeping you from exploring either, its a perfect source of downtime.  It's not difficult, but it's engaging.  The various possible upgrades to the farm kept me interested, and wanting to make everything as efficient as possible.  Something about it is addicting in the best possible way.  There are a few other sectors to your own farm you can unlock as well, the most game changing being the Slime Science area.
This mechanic makes the game far more interesting, now you can craft teleporters between the outside areas, item transporters, many decorative objects, and many other random things to play around with.  It makes the possible efficiency of your farm to the next level.  On that matter, the game is crafted perfectly so it's impossible to fully automate your farm, no matter what you do, and I like that.  It is a farming simulator on some level, so its good that no matter what you do, you still need to do something to keep it running.  The slime science area also allows you to unlock ""Treasure Pods"".  These are strewn about the world, and cannot be unlocked unless you open the Slime Science area.  But the Slime Science area is so expensive that you'll probably only unlock it after you've already explored all the areas, meaning it's the perfect incentive to go back out and explore even more.  Especially because most recipes to craft Slime Science things are in these.  The game also has 3 free pieces of DLC, each of which is like an advanced mini game.  I'll be honest, only 2 of these are interesting, the other one's kind of annoying, but that's just my opinion.
I know that this is way too long (hell I just had to delete what I was planning to be my second to last segment just to fit into the character limit), but I cannot emphasize enough how good this game is.  It's my second most played game on Steam at over 500 hours.  It's only $20 on Steam, it's totally worth it.  11/10.",10,10

metacritic,DJKrimson,slime-rancher,"Had a good time playing this. It's that type of game where you're ""just gonna do this last thing"" and end up playing 2 more hours than you planned. You're basically roaming around the world, searching for slimes to bring back to your farm. And when you've had them in your farm a certain amount of time you get money which you use to get upgrades and unlock new areas.

Not sure why but I got serious fps drops as soon as I had a chrome page or a steam chatbox open. Extremely annoying, I never have performance issues with other games.

Would recommend though. Very priceworthy as it goes for only 20 EUR.",7,10
metacritic,PrincessRose,slime-rancher,"A joyfully cute game, this game made me feel happy playing it and I got hooked into the adorable charm of it, found it hard to stop playing at first but this game is pretty basic and is not particularly deep.
It's pretty much a gameplay loop of catch slimes, feed them to make money for upgrades and unlocking more areas of the ranch.

You can also explore the map, kill tarrs and work on getting everything with your lab.
It gets a bit too repetitive, not diverse enough in what you can do and the charm of it for me wears off after around 8 hours.

I still recommend though as it's cute and made me feel happy at how adorable it is.

It's not good for long term play or those wanting a more serious game.
It's a good game if you want something chill and relaxing.",7,10

metacritic,Guaxinimzinho,slime-rancher,"For sure, this game grabbed me completely. At first, I thought it would be weird... a farm game of slimes where you collect their poop? I never thought it would be so funny and relaxing... but it is! I can't give another rate but 10. Call me weirdo, but I've played more than 90 hours at Steam, i don't know why, but I really liked it, maybe it's because it's the perfect game for who wants to play and listen a podcast while, or maybe because I keep waiting for each update to see what's the newest slime added, or maybe because this game is the best game indie I've played in mounths.

> Simple gameplay
>Clean audio
>Beautiful and charming graphics
>Periodic Updates
>Offline (you can play during a trip, for example)

>Can be repetitive after some time playing

metacritic,FrontierMagnum,slime-rancher,"This is one of the best indie games i've played in a while, Seriously in my opinion this game is on the level of Undertale its so good. It's addicting, yet simple gameplay sets it apart from many other game as this is a game that is meant to be just good old simple fun that any on can enjoy. This is one of those games where you will say ""Just five more minutes"" Until it's 3:30 AM. With the gameplay, the art style and how much there is to explore you'll be playing this game for a while. It is a shame that it isn't on PS4 though but it might be some day.",10,10
metacritic,nilsy,slime-rancher,"This game did not grab me.
Gave it hours and hours of gameplay long after i just wanted to remove it from my harddrive, all in vain still boring.

Its hard to point to any real errors in the game other then the jetpack energy system used to try to get around high areas to explore, standing still waiting for energy to come back is not fun.

Its possible it gets fun if i put in 100 more hours who knows but thats the thing, would not enjoy a single one of those so uninstall and count my losses.",3,10
metacritic,Beardtrick,slime-rancher,"It lacks an in-depth story and the game-play can be repetitive, however the other areas to which this game excels more than makes up for it's flaws. The art style is charming yet clean and the surprisingly low poly count allows for great performance. The games audio is similarly clean and matches the games style. Later mechanics in the game such as slime costumes really give you a sense of progression and help push you to spend just one more hour. The game isn't for everyone, if you dislike action repetition like mining in minecraft this game can be a real turn off. For me this game is a delight to play, and will likely remain as one of those games i consistantly come back to.

metacritic,rodericrinehart,slime-rancher,"My daughter loved it enough that I actually played it out of curiosity. It was actually very fun.

Si algo me ha detenido ha sido la certeza de que sin mando no se puede jugar, y no siempre es posible reponerlo, así que… hay que aprender a aguantarse. Esto me ha pasado con pocos juegos, soy un jugador paciente y que confía en su experiencia y tablas de gamer veterano para terminar el juego que tengo entre manos por difícil que sea. Pues bien, lo reconozco, Ori and the blind forest me ha sacado de mis casillas. Es el metroidvania más difícil que he jugado. Ni Blasphemous, ni Castlevania, ni Metroid ni hostias. He soltado improperios que se han oído en casa de mis vecinos, he jurado contra los creadores del juego y sus familias y sí, ha habido ocasiones que he tenido que apagar la consola porque estaba hasta los huevos de morirme. Qué mala hostia está contenida en el diseño de este juego. A priori es bonito y mono y su historia te atrapa con sentimentalismo, pero luego…. Es despiadado, te tortura hasta límites insospechados, llamándote manco con cada muerte entre paredes llenas de pinchos, disparos por todas partes como si fuera un bullet hell y puzzles y pruebas que te sacarán de tus casillas por no ser lo suficientemente rápido… o listo.

A su favor diré que el juego es precioso, la historia bonita y que merece la pena darle un tiento porque sin duda se lo han currado. Pero tened claro a lo que os enfrentáis. ¿Dark Souls? Ori se ríe de los Dark Souls y no alardea de ello. Hay que ser rápido de sesera y de manos para superar Ori and The Blind Forest.

metacritic,BlueStark,ori-and-the-blind-forest,"Sin duda el género de Metroidvania ha generado en los últimos años una ola de juegos índies o AA que han tomado el relevo de sus creadores.
Orí and the Blind Forest trata de unificar esas mecanicas junto a un apartado visual que sólo puede describirse como de ensueño. El apartado técnico de Orí en lo referente al diseño visual y sonoro es sublime. Una obra maestra en dichos términos que traspasa lo que estamos acostumbrados a recibir en obras más comerciales o en la simplicidad de los juegos que rinden tributo a generaciones antiguas basadas en el pixel Art. Uk problema menor derivado de este ambición en lo visual, es que muchas veces los límites entre el fondo y el escenario en que nuestro personaje se mueve no están claros, esto hace que seamos víctimas de algunas muertes muy fácilmente por no reconocer una plataforma, un pincho o que un decorado nos obstruya parte de la visión en un salto. Lamentablemente en la parte jugable, Orí peca de varios errores que le impiden brillar como Metroidvania. En este género, la exploración es fundamental y está muy ligada al desarrollo del personaje. La satisfacción de conseguir un power up y volver a repasar una parte del mapa que antes nos costó trabajo y ahora poder explorar con facilidad es una de las mejores sensaciones. Y esto, Orí falla y bastante. Nuestro personaje es indudablemente muy débil, los enemigos y trampas prácticamente nos matan de uno o dos golpes, y hasta muy avanzado el juego, o sea casi al final, la exploración del terreno se convierte en más frustración que diversión. Pará paliar esto, se ha incluido una mecánica original de salvar en cualquier parte a costa de consumir parte de nuestra barra de energía, la cual también se utiliza para algunos ataques cargados y otras acciones como abrir puertas. Esta solución al problema anterior, deriva en otro problema mayor. Acostumbrarnos a salvar en cada momento es muy tedioso, y como dependemos de una energía que tiene límite, estaremos debatiendonos constantemente entre utilizarla o no. Muchas veces repetiremos varias secciones una y otra vez debido a esto pues se nos olvido salvar y moriremos obligándonos a repetir todo una secciones de 10 mn o más de juego. También este salvado manual nos complica enormemente si no sabemos elegir bien el lugar donde lo realizamos, y nos puede dejar vendidos completamente. El combate es Orí es bastante flojo, apenas tiene complicación más allá de movernos y lanzar una esfera de energía que ataca semiautomáticamente o devolver ataques de enemigos. El juego de igual forma carece de enemigos o cambates con Jefes Finales y plantea una suerte de EndlesRun como sustituto. Dichas secciones tienden a ser bastantes intensas y podrían ser aún mejor sino dependiera tanto del conocimiento del trazado para poder completarlos, por lo que se tornan en una suerte de prueba y error.

Al final, no puedo decir que el juego sea malo ni mucho menos, sencillamente es un juego con un envoltorio hermoso, que rodea una jugabilidad carente de originalidad y con problemas de diseño.",7,10

You have learned a new ability? Then have fun to back track a big section of the level and see the same stuff and enemies again. If you can ignore that, the rest of the gameplay is still basic jump and run. Enemies are a chore. The only good thing on this game is the artstyle.

+ solid all around metroidvania/platformer/ game

- combat is too basic, and is more annoying than challenging

This being one of the first xbox games I've actually played from start to finished, and is supposedly one of their better ""exclusives"", overall it was an alright first xbox experience. I think I can sum up my experience in this game in one sentence, everything moon studios does in this game is good, however nothing they did is mind-blowing, and nothing they did was awful. It was just all around a good game, decent platformer and metroidvania. If there was one big drawback in this game, was that I've seen everything in this game.. done in other platformers and metroidvanias before. Solid game, just nothing blew me away.",8,10

metacritic,apeot2002,ori-and-the-will-of-the-wisps,"Larger, prettier, more forgiving: Ori and the Will of the Wisp is a worthy successor

Ori and the Blind Forest combined the charme of a Rayman game with the cruelty of Dark Souls. Ori and the Will of the Wisp makes no bones about its heritage, but attempts to bring meaningful improvement to the weaker aspects of its predecessor.

The core game is unchanged: Ori, a small woodland spirit who might as well hail from a Studio Ghibli film, jumps, runs and fights his way through a collection of landscapes organized as a 2D metroidvania game. All the core movement mechanics and combat skills are still here and just as delightful to employ as ever. The Wisps brought Ori a few more combat moves, which is nice of them, but we have to pick and choose which three of them we want mapped to the upper three action button (the lowest as ever triggers the jump). This is an unwelcome change from the Blind Forest, where the entire move roster was accessible at all times, but I do get that when you add more moves to a character whose move set already made use of every feasible button combination, something has to give.

What else has changed? The art has improved quite a bit, which is high praise since the Blind Forest already was a stunner ****. There are a lot more detailed animations bringing the environments to life, and the regions are much more varied now, as are the enemies. The difficulty curve has been flattened a bit, mostly because Ori doesn’t die at the merest touch of a hostile bit of environment any more. A few bona fide boss fights as well as chase scenes brought over from the Blind Forest make for satisfying region climaxes. There is quite a bit more real estate to explore. A few NPCs handing out exposition and quests are a welcome addition. 

The script isn’t exactly stellar, but I was surprised how much drama and pathos can be wrung out of utilitarian writing in a children’s story that is uncompromising enough to go to some surprisingly dark and fascinating places. This game tells the kind of children’s tale  that doesn’t talk down to its audience and does include the odd scare now and then. 

All in all, the Will of the Wisp is a kinder, gentler, prettier Ori. It only occasionally tries to prove a rage quit from you, except for the final fight, which, it might be argued, is allowed to be unfair at times. And now and then it even lobs a surprisingly good story beat at you. All of this makes Ori and the Will of the Wisps an excellent Metroidvania.

TLDR: Come for the pretty, stay for the challenge. Or the satisfying movement. Or the joy and tears the story will bring. There are many reasons.",8,10

I played Ori and the Blind Forest first and liked it pretty well. The most impressive thing about this game to me is that they improved literally every single element from Blind Forest. Will of the Wisps takes the flaws of Blind Forest and fixes them and takes the good of Blind Forest and makes it absolutely incredible.
The graphics are drop-dead gorgeous. The scenery looks like it could have been the subject of a Van Gogh painting or something.
I don't have the words to describe how good the music is. Listening to the soundtrack is nearly a spiritual experience for me.
The gameplay is fantastic. Ori's movement is so fluid and incredibly satisfying. The movement is so fun I don't actually want to use fast travel. The combat is probably the biggest improvement from Blind Forest and allows for a lot of creativity on the player's part.
The story is beautiful and the ending nearly moves me to tears every time.

Uno de los puntos más fuertes del juego redica en como se cuenta la historia, el juego logra presentar una secuencia de eventos al jugador que ayudan a mantener el ritmo en un combate principal, nuevamente, logrando una sinergia total de lo que los creadores querían hacer.

From stunning visuals, story, and soundtrack to the most smooth platforming and amazing combat, this game exceeds all **** and the Will of the Wisps is a platformer in which you play as a little spirit named Ori, who gets caught in a storm while flying on his owl friend, Ku. He is left abandoned in an unknown place, separated from Ku. From there you must attempt to navigate your way through an unfamiliar, hostile world, and avoid the terrifying creature, **** and the Will of the Wisps is one of the most beautiful games I have ever seen. The world is lush with so much depth in the background, in the world, and on the edges of the screen. The locations range from the frosty Baur’s Reach, The lush, colorful, and whimsical Luma Pools, To the eerie and pitch black Mouldwood Depths. And to top this all off, it is all painted by **** story is engaging and extremely sad, where we get to take a look at how the villain came to be, as well as Ori’s journey. The soundtrack throughout this is absolutely incredible, from the most epic boss battle themes you’ll ever hear to the very sad tracks. It is all played on an orchestra, and has some of the coolest songs ever. My favourites are Luma Pools, a beautiful song with a choir, A Shine Apon Inkwater Marsh which has such a cool climax to the song that gives me shivers every time, and Mora the Spider, an epic boss track. All of these songs fit so well with the game and contribute significantly to the game. The platforming and combat in this game is some of the best I've seen. The movement is so smooth, with dashing and double jumps making the platforming feel amazing. The combat is super, super fun, as you get to unlock really cool weapons and chain together attacks and spells to defeat enemies. The shard system is awesome too, giving you different perks. Overall, this is my favourite game of all time, and if you haven’t played it before, you’re seriously missing out. This game is so incredible, props to the developers for creating this masterpiece.",10,10

INTRODUCTION:
Ori and the Will of the Wisps was developed by Moon Studios and released in March 2020. As the sequel to Ori and the Blind Forest, it boasts improvements in all aspects, both technically and creatively, enhancing the beauty of an already excellent title. The game has been fully completed at 100%.

FIRST STEPS:
The introduction of Ori and the Will of the Wisps consists of short playable sequences interspersed with scenes illustrating the growth of Ori and Ku, the young owl born after the events of the first chapter. These scenes provide information about the characters of Ori and Ku for those who haven't played the first game and showcase their development for those who have. Moreover, the small movement phases give players a taste of what the gameplay will be like throughout the game. Once the introductory sequence is completed, the player finds themselves alone, fighting the corruption that afflicts the forest of Niwen, and a good set of skills is essential to survive and progress in the story. Finally, during the save creation, players can select the difficulty level, which is divided into three stages, with pretty huge gaps.

ESCAPING FROM ""THINGS"":
The gameplay of Ori and the Will of the Wisps is that of a pure Metroidvania, a genre based on the progression of the game map through power-ups found at different points in the story. This ensures that players have several hours of exploration to overcome previously inaccessible paths. Additionally, the gameplay is fast-paced and frenetic thanks to various obtainable dashes. Like the first game, there will be various power-ups, with at least one in each game area, allowing players to explore hidden portions of the map. However, this second installment adds several complexities not present in the first one, incorporating more distinct RPG elements. Players can equip up to 3 usable abilities with different effects, both for combat and exploration. These abilities can be freely swapped at any time without cost, and the game freezes to simplify this exchange. There are also several equipable perks available from the pause menu, which provide effective buffs to Ori's combat skills or sustenance. Passive upgrades that unlock through game progression are also present. A hub with various interactable NPCs has been introduced, useful for purchasing and upgrading the aforementioned abilities. It is also designed to accommodate different secondary quests that provide in-game currency, damage and sustenance upgrades, as well as further development of the game's storyline. One of the most appreciated mechanics from the first game, the enemy chase scenes, has been multiplied and greatly improved, adding exciting variety to the gameplay. Finally, true bosses with unique mechanics and designs have been added.

THE RADIANCE:
The most impressive and carefully crafted aspect of this game is undoubtedly its graphics and the aesthetics of its game world. Every detail, be it animations, backgrounds, cutscenes, or enemies, is meticulously designed. In each game environment, players can pause to admire the background and discover an infinite number of details. The use of colors to evoke certain sensations is carefully crafted, with darker and gloomier areas adorned with vibrant colors to provide a sense of tranquility for players, and tranquil areas where formidable enemies lurk, easily predictable thanks to the game map's design. The menus themselves reveal the passion with which this game was developed, with drawings and illustrations that update during gameplay in response to encountered events. The addition of three-dimensional cutscenes further showcases the studio's skill in pushing their boundaries, bringing to life an astonishing title like this.

THE CALL OF THE FOREST:
The soundtrack of this game is impressive and surpasses that of its predecessor, incorporating different styles and evolving the ones already used. The attention to sound effects perfectly complements what has been described for the aesthetic aspect.

BUT WHY A 9?

PROS:
The merits of this game are so numerous that they are indescribable in such few characters. This is one of those reasons to purchase a console, as it was exclusive for years. It is an almost flawless title that reaches aesthetic levels capable of setting a very high bar in the 2D platforming landscape.

CONS:
The drawbacks are extremely limited. They could be the limited number of different enemies or the potential bugs that can be encountered. The lack of a true endgame area, present in the first game, can also be considered a con. Additionally, the inspiration from Hollow Knight could be seen as a downside since various features, such as the amulets, are clearly influenced. Lastly, due to the game's frenetic pace, combat can often become chaotic and it is easy to take damage without realizing it.

It's apparent that the series took some lessons from Hollow Knight, and the combat and sense of exploration from that game can be seen here.  The art design looks absolutely fantastic, and the feeling of movement as you navigate through well-designed watery worlds and forests is a rush.

On the downside, although it's very good, this game doesn't quite match Hollow Knight.  The combat is a bit messy, and a step below the precise movements of Hollow Knight.  I was very ""meh"" about the storyline.  It's a bit oversentimental for my taste.",8,10

metacritic,pmasterfunk,ori-and-the-will-of-the-wisps,"I didn't like the first Ori very much. I thought enemies were hard to see, some of the platforming was frustrating, the chase sequences frustrating, navigating the world a pain...

Wasn't a fan.

Will of the Wisps solves basically all the issues I had with the first.

It's even prettier than the first game. The different locales all look and feel different, and the level design is improved.

The action is also better this time around. Instead of shooting tiny dumb sparks, Ori has a cool spectral sword. Secondary weapons involve a wimpy bow, a grenade-like projectile, a Guilty Gear Burst, and a massive exploding spear.

The spear is awesome.

And the improved arsenal actually comes in useful in the brand spanking new boss fights. Boss fights! In an Ori game! They're actually pretty fun if a bit messy.

I still have the odd issue here and there. Some late-game platforming can get frustrating, though it's not as bad as some of the stuff from the first game. The final form of the final boss actually confused me, I had no idea what I was supposed to do. Was I supposed to find a platform that was off-screen, like in the previous steps of the boss fight? Where's the boss attacking from? What's with all this smoke? I can't see anything, help a brother out.

Anywho, that issue only took a few minutes to resolve, and is a pretty minor blemish on this very good game. The story even has some poignant moments.

Will of the Wisps won't make it onto my all-time favorite list, but it is extremely well made. It's gorgeous, touching, and just plain fun.",9,10

metacritic,Sillybear,ori-and-the-will-of-the-wisps,"Its visuals are beautiful, its gameplay satisfying, its music powerful, and its story touching. Since I completed Ori and the Blind Forest a couple of years ago, a followup had been high on my list of anticipated games, and I am beyond happy to say that Ori and the Will of the Wisps gave me everything I wanted in a sequel and more. With a relaxed pace playthrough lasting me just over 12 hours, the launch price of $29.99 is well worth the cost of entry. The performance of the game was excellent on my PC (980 Ti/i5 6600k/16 GB DDR4) that is approaching 5 years old, and aside from a couple of minor audio/visual bugs that did not impact my gameplay experience, the game was incredibly well polished for its day one release, which is refreshing in this day and age.

The landscapes, the music and the story are still amazing, the plot is even better than in the first game. The only issue for me, personally, was the amount of frustrating combats which, for me, don't suit to actual ambiance and style of Ori games. Nevertheless, this is still one of the best platform games out there, totally worth playing. Looking forward for the next title from the series.",9,10

metacritic,EasyGamerBoi,ori-and-the-will-of-the-wisps,"This game is beautiful. Like wow, I really think it’s in the Top 10 most gorgeous games I’ve ever played. The score is incredible too. The story is so heartfelt but also isn’t afraid to get dark at times. The moment to moment gameplay can be tough but so rewarding and addictive. It’s a fair kind of difficulty that challenged me but didn’t break me. Of course at times I got very frustrated at some chase sequences & puzzles, but for a Metroidvania style game I never felt lost. Ori & Ku are adorable & I’m really curious as to where Moon Studios can take the series next. The biggest downside aside from momentary difficulty spikes is the tendency for the background to get blurry, like a motion blur but a lot more distorted. I highly HIGHLY doubt it’s my Xbox, this is the first game I’ve played on my brand new Series X & I played it on 4K 120fps. Not sure what the blur was about, but it cost me more than a few deaths at times. There wasn’t an option in the graphic settings to turn off any motion blur so I’m at a loss as to what design choice that was. I still highly recommend this title to anyone with an Xbox as long as you’re ok with tough but fair platforming.",8,10

A phenomenal sequel to the first part. The game is pure art. The level design is fantastic, the graphics are concise and extremely vivid with lots of beautiful colors. The controls are simple and basic, and the boss fights are extremely challenging, the gameplay is fluid and on the next-gen Xbox supports 120hz in 4K, the music is amazing, a perfect synergy of graphics, gameplay, music. There was a small problem with one level, but Microsoft quickly released the patch and made that stage easier. The main character is great and has abilities that are unlocked and extremely helpful in further progress. One of the best Xbox exclusives.

Jugablemente es una maravilla, es un salto muy grande con respecto al primero ya que en mi opinion el primer ori tenia una jugabilidad muy limitada que la hacia aburrida. En este aspecto esta segunda entrega se ha sabido renovar en la jugabilidad, teniendo muy presente a mi parecer el mejor juego del genero como es Hollow knight, y sinceramente le ha sentado de lujo que haya introducido elementos de hollow. Tambien una de las cosas que ha mejorado con respecto al primero son los bosses que nos daran combates epicos sobre todo en nivel alto. Para terminar creo que la historia es muy bonita y hace que te encariñes de los personajes, con lo que da al juego un sentimiento de añoranza muy grande.

metacritic,sityoazzdown,ori-and-the-will-of-the-wisps,"Pros:
- Graphics, presentation, themes
- Vastly improved combat, great boss fights
- good platforming sections
- charming story with a great ending

So-So:
- Side missions, and in general most side content (shards/powerups) are uninteresting and underwhelming/ unrewarding.

Cons:
- The metroidvania elements in this game aren't very deep, I tried to look through every nook and cranny only to find life and mana powerups, and money 95% of the time. It all ties back to the so-so section... the shards was a wasted opportunity, rarely there, and not very interesting.

Will of the wisps is an amazing linear experience, with improved combat, emotional story, and pretty good platforming. The side content and metroidvania elements, however was underwhelming.

Some of the side quests are somewhat interesting, but there is little variety. It's basically all about killing scores and scores of people. There is little enemy variety, and strategy & tactics are simple. The game engine is very limited in what it allows you to do, so everything becomes repetitive. There is little item variety, so looting is largely pointless, as is discovery and exploration.There is this huge open world begging to be filled with content. And the world itself has a lot of variety.

Pros
1) Large territory to explore : I really liked to walk into that antic Egypt, it's like a time travel.
2)the simplified gameplay : This game is easy to play in general.
Cons
1) Extremely repetitive, you do the same tasks over and over again. It's very boring when the game force you to grow up your level to continue with the main story.
2)the difficulty is based upon the level of the enemies, but not upon their skills, this is very ridiculous because you always feal forced to grow up your level.",7,10

metacritic,Cuauhtemocz,assassins-creed-origins,"The Assassin's Creed franchise, which has become one of the most iconic and successful franchises in modern gaming, known for its stealth combat & exploration elements and split between a predominant setting in a remarkable period of past history (from the Crusades to the Renaissance, among others) and some sections of a story set in the present, all part of the long time conflict between Assassin and Templar factions (and adding a bunch of sci-fi elements from the fictional Isu civilization), became saturated with yearly releases, no matter how fresh the settings could be, and, even if it has translated reasonably well into the PS4 era with Unity and Syndicate, a shift was needed to, if not return the series to shape, create a new shape for it, so Origins started development, and was released after a longer time than the previous (and later) titles, and the differences show. Set in the last years of the Ptolemaic era of ancient Egypt, you play as Bayek of Siwa, one of the Medjay (a very ancient name which was once used by ancient Egyptians to refer to a nomadic group in Nubia, and later became synonym with desert ranger police. By the time of the Ptolemaic Egypt this name was no longer employed but this is just the first of the somewhat tolerable creative liberties the story takes) who wants to avenge the death of his son at the hands of the ""Order of the Ancients"" (a group of masked people in positions of influence over all the known world, from Egypt to Greece and Rome. As you explore further you'll find out such an order allegedly exists since 14th century b.c, the times of Smenkhkare) that was on the search for Isu artefacts, like their future counterpart, the Templars. The story occasionally contradicts lore established in Assassin's Creed II but also affirms part of it through the character Aya, a.k.a Amunet, at the start of the story Bayek's wife. The story is somewhat long but mostly engaging, save for a few of the antagonists who are terribly lame, written as plain petty villains. But the true highlight of the game is its' open world. Origins' rendition of ancient Egypt is gorgeous, from the different kinds of sand in the deserts, the Oasis, Savannas, the green mountains, to the seas, the swamps of the Nile marshes, and the cities of Alexandria, displaying its Hellenic heritage in full splendour, or the huge city of Memphis, a vibrant city that sums up ancient life in Egypt, plus the pyramids, the tomb exploration, the arena of Cyrene, which feels in itself a small version of Rome, all of it is top notch eye candy and holds up to this day. Even realizing that some of the smaller towns reuse certain assets, I still don't find it's reused enough to become bothersome or repetitive (like the later AC open world titles). I only wish they added at least a few small towns in the eastern marsh of the Nile, because it feels really incomplete and robs a bit of the immersive experience. And Alexandria & Cyrene could've used more colour at least in most of the statues than just the white marble. The game starts with a bang in one of the biggest if not the biggest tomb in the game. The RPG elements take a very superficial influence from Witcher 3 and aren't as fleshed out as in its successor, Odyssey, but are good enough to offer a certain variety of weapons, from maces to spears, swords and daggers. I've played it only in 2019 onwards so at least most bugs were apparently fixed. Even past 1000 hours of gameplay I still feel it has some freshness thanks to its world. I also recommend playing with the least elements in the HUD as possible for greater immersion. As someone who loves ancient history, Egypt in particular, even if this isn't perfect (sometimes the story feels more like a modern one than an accurate representation of Ptolemaic Egypt, with all Romans there being white, conveniently forgetting many Roman soldiers historically assigned to there, aside the Gabiniani who were German in origin, came from the Near East and other regions of northern Africa), it's a treat and one I found much more enjoyable than Odyssey. While Odyssey improved customization, it destroyed the stealth element and made combat much more bland, plus Odyssey's world doesn't live up to its predecessor, and its' story is the worst in the series, whereas Origins' is pretty great and Bayek's actor makes an incredible performance. I didn't need to pay a single cent for the additional items and costumes but it required a lot of grind, one which I didn't mind as long as it was in this world. But it's a negative point for an almost perfect game (despite the combat is admittedly repetitive, even dull after certain time). I recommend Origins over any other modern era AC title.",9,10
metacritic,thethethe4,assassins-creed-origins,"Egypt is a beautiful world to explore. The combat is different, but not in a bad way. It's an acceptable progression of assassins creed mechanics. Stealth is still present, and a viable option for encounters. The large map makes parkour hard to do but it's still fun. The story is stock standard, but it gets the job done. There is a lot of side content so your bound to find something you like. There are microtransactions which are irritating, but it doesn't effect the experience to much. Assassin's Creed Origins is an expected progression of the Assassin's Creed formula that is worth the time and money to play.",8,10

The story is good for the most part and Bayek is a very interesting protagonist alongside Aya.

La historia es buena, aunque como se basa en misiones principales con un nivel, al que tienes que llegar para poder hacerla, te ves obligado a hacer otras actividades, como misiones secundarias para poder completar las principales. la historia se pierde un poco ahí, pero las misiones secundarias son de mas o menos buena calidad, lo cual te puede agregar muchas mas horas de diversión, a tal punto que se te podría hacer pesado.

metacritic,miri_regev,call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3,"Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 delivers a high-stakes, action-packed conclusion to the original Modern Warfare trilogy. It picks up right where MW2 left off and wastes no time throwing players into massive global conflicts, explosive set pieces, and intense **** campaign is a non-stop thrill ride, with solid pacing and satisfying payoffs to long-running character arcs. While it doesn’t quite reach the emotional highs or originality of MW1 or MW2, it’s still an exciting, cinematic experience that wraps up the story in a satisfying way.Multiplayer is fast, responsive, and packed with content—refining the familiar formula with new killstreak systems, more customization, and a great selection of maps. It doesn’t revolutionize the series, but it perfects what fans love about it.Spec Ops mode also returns, offering fun co-op missions and a Survival mode that adds replayability outside of competitive play.Modern Warfare 3 may not be the most groundbreaking in the series, but it’s a polished, highly entertaining shooter from start to finish.8/10",8,10

Above anything else the servers are just horrible. Can’t play one game without stutters and lag packet loss, yet I play any other game out right now and don’t have a single issue. This company no longer listens to their customers it’s about how quickly and how deep they can reach into your pockets every single year.

metacritic,Aroganos,call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3,"Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, sorti en 2011, a marqué un moment charnière dans la franchise en offrant une expérience de jeu diversifiée et captivante. La campagne solo, bien que critiquée par certains pour son manque d'originalité par rapport aux titres précédents, a réussi à maintenir un niveau élevé d'intensité et **** narration immersive et les visuels exceptionnels, qui étaient révolutionnaires à l'époque, ont permis à MW3 de se démarquer. Les scénarios bien ficelés et les personnages mémorables ont contribué à créer une expérience cinématographique engageante. Malgré le passage du temps, la campagne solo continue de résonner avec les fans de la série.Cependant, c'est dans le domaine multijoueur que Modern Warfare 3 a réellement brillé. Les développeurs ont réussi à capturer l'essence compétitive de la série en proposant des cartes variées, des armes équilibrées et des modes de jeu palpitants. Le système de progression, avec son système de classe et de déverrouillage d'accessoires, a incité les joueurs à s'investir pleinement dans le **** mode Spec Ops a apporté une touche coopérative unique, offrant des missions stimulantes que les joueurs pouvaient aborder en équipe. Cela a renforcé le côté social du jeu, encourageant la collaboration et renforçant la communauté des joueurs.Bien que loué pour ses mérites, Modern Warfare 3 n'était pas sans défauts. Certains ont critiqué le manque d'innovation par rapport aux opus précédents, arguant que le jeu suivait une formule éprouvée plutôt que de repousser les limites. De plus, des problèmes de déséquilibre dans le multijoueur et des questions de connectivité ont été soulignés, bien que des correctifs ultérieurs aient atténué ces problèmes.Malgré ces critiques, Modern Warfare 3 a laissé une empreinte indélébile sur l'histoire des jeux vidéo. Son impact sur l'industrie et la manière dont il a redéfini les attentes pour les futurs jeux de tir en font un incontournable pour les amateurs du genre. Que ce soit pour revivre la campagne intense ou plonger dans le multijoueur compétitif, MW3 reste un classique apprécié des joueurs du monde entier.",10,10

Developer Infinity Ward had done great work with the first two ""Call of Duty"" games. But by setting this third-sequel in modern times, they elevated the formula. The campaign is perhaps the best in the entire series. And the competitive multiplayer proved to be highly influential. This is one of the best first-person shooters of all time.

metacritic,Cod_fan2yu3y2,call-of-duty-4-modern-warfare,"Call of duty 4: Modern warfare might just be the best shooter game of the 2000s. To start, the campaign is damn near perfect, as the story is intriguing and interesting. Just playing the campaign I had a great time. I also feel the campaign is just fun to play. The multiplayer is also great, as the maps are fun to play on, and while a few maps did have some annoying camping spots, the maps are still great. The guns are another thing I would like to talk about. The guns are both ionic and fun to use. The M16 is my personal favorite. The cool thing about the game was there were lots of guns but none were (to) broken. The kill streak system was simple and fun to use. The new gun camos were fun to grind and they looked good. As much as I loved this gane however, I can see some big issues. Mainly the perks. Some perks are just hella annoying, for example juggernaut. This perk gives you extra health and pretty much guarantees whoever has it a free win. But other than that the game is near perfection and is a solid 10/10",10,10

metacritic,Alex_Pilgrim008,call-of-duty-4-modern-warfare,"""Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare"" is a masterpiece. This is one of the greatest video games of all time. The first COD entry set in modern times, it was developed by series creator Infinity Ward. When MW was first revealed to the public, I immediately thought of Tom Clancy's ""Rainbow Six"" titles. Indeed, the game has a very Clancy-esque feel due to a realistic scenario. It doesn't feature the Jerry Bruckheimer-like bombast of the sequel. The campaign is flawless and the online multiplayer is in the tradition of ""Counter Strike"". Over ten years old, ""Call of Duty 4"" is still a fantastic game. I would give it a 9.4 out of 10.",9,10

The game has proven to be a landmark with shooters to the point of why such a saturation of them has been so endless in the last decade. The gunplay is still snap quick and awesome, with an interesting design choice of missions and a multiplayer system that made squad tactics and communication an absolute must. The only downsides to the game is a few perks in multiplayer were far more potent than others and parts of the campaign did feel silly at times. Regardless, Call of Duty 4 is still a king of shooters in the eyes of many of its fans and I cannot deny such a force that helped put its franchise on the map.",9,10

While the series would expand with a great sequel, CoD4 is regarded as one of the most important games of the 2000-2009 decade and is still talked about with great fondness to this day.  So much so that Infinity Wars, creators of CoD4, are remastering it with a special release of Infinite Warfare in 2016.  For me, Modern Warfare and Modern Warfare 2 hold some of my most memorable moments in campaign and multiplayer.  If you haven't played them and you're a shooter fan, you owe it to yourself to give the Modern Warfare series a play-through..",10,10
metacritic,psylife,call-of-duty-4-modern-warfare,"This game follows the trail left by Allied Assault while successfully bringing the formula to the next level.This is a masterclass in single player campaign pacing and scenario. Expert and respectful checkpoint placement means that you will never redo a section previously beaten twice. Playing on hard is highly recommended as the various mechanics and level design will be more thoroughly experienced. The shooting is both varied and weighty. The levels are designed in such a way as to hint the player towards multiple possible tactical approaches ; Choosing to storm the inside of a building is as challenging as it should and might reward you with a unique vantage point. The various set pieces are seamlessly integrated and never feel odd or disconnected from the main mechanics. The voice acting is great and the minimalist story telling keeps the scenario engaging and fairly credible. That said, the game is clearly part of a sophisticated war propaganda machine and is likely indirectly responsible for the death of many young testosterone filled adolescents in need of adventure ; I believe this will be rightly regarded as a historical piece of Zionist propaganda down the line. The main villain's name is even named after the current president of Syria, whom the Zionists are currently trying to actively murder ; Russian patriots are also antagonized. The visuals, animations and lighting hold surprisingly well, and thoroughly immerse . Modern warfare is not only a good shooter, it is simply one of the best FPS experience of all time and deserves to be celebrated as such.",7,10
metacritic,Jimi360,call-of-duty-4-modern-warfare,"Though the franchise as a whole may have outstayed its welcome due to it being a money-making machine, there's no escaping the fact that Call of Duty 4 is exceptional in every aspect that it attempts to target. Single-player is by no means a drag, and provides memorable characters that you will care about in the line of duty, as well as some jaw-dropping sequences.

The real highlight here however, is the multiplayer. Creating your own classes to suit your style of play, or to suit the map you're going to be playing on if you've planned that far ahead, Modern Warfare will provide you with endless hours of entertainment and fantastic first-person shooting mechanics that is only rivalled by Halo 3. An absolute blast whether you are playing solo or with friends, and a true legend within the multiplayer gaming world.",9,10

(4-7 hrs. long) However, multiplayer is where the game shines! It´s extremely addictive and very enjoyable, maps are great, a variety of weapons, and overall fun. Downsides are that there are too  many host migrations and that hosts can do whatever they want. Also, the game is filled with hackers, especially the PS3 version.

Visually, it looks great with photo-realistic graphics that reminded me of ""Resident Evil 7"". Multiplayer isn't as evolved as the story mode, but it's still good. And Spec Ops can be fun online with a team, but it's too tough for single players. However, it's not quite as good as Spec Ops from MW 2 and 3.

metacritic,eva3si0n,call-of-duty-modern-warfare,"Call of Duty: Modern Warfare (2019) is a soft relaunch of the franchise subseries. If it succeeded in terms of technological development and multiplayer, the single player clearly went in a different direction. Of course, after several futuristic parts of the series and WW2, returning to our time slot was the best decision of the franchise. But Modern Warfare is no longer about scale. Gray morality which is rather brown, and if you can look at ""bad Russians"" through tears, then there are no holes in the plot. Given that the first MW was released 12 years ago of this part, it is remembered much better. There is not one memorable mission here. I passed MW (2019) on PC in the year of release and now on PS4.

I personaly think mp was 10/10, doors being the biggest reason to change my playstyle a bit for the better.
Gameplay and animations are luvly. 
But the story, while good, showed historical innaccuracy that shouldn't be ignored. 
It felt original and showed that there ain't no mercy in wars. 
Farah & Alex are suprising addition to the story, especialy Farah for not being inclined to todays standarts that just ruin the world as we know it.

4 hour install on Monday after work, left the ps5 on rest mode to install. Tuesday after work just getting settled to play it and it’s saying the campaign is not installed? What on earth took 4 hours to install then? And why wasn’t it the campaign! So then there was about 7 boxes all saying install next to them, top of them being campaign, clearly says on the right - “this campaign pack needs to be installed to play campaign” so I installed that Tuesday night, 2.5 hour wait. Thought I would try again on Wednesday after work.

Tonight I tried to play again, but it says “installation suspended” under the campaign menu, so I’m tearing my hair out and I google it and google is telling me I need to download other packs for the campaign to work. About 4 boxes down there is one that says “campaign and special ops optimisation pack” or something along those lines, so I have started that download, 2 hours.

Ubisoft once again killed their game.
They can't think with their sole brain cell.
What a shame to change the devs all the time and take a creativeteam that don't know the game.
""change ranked it would be a good idea"" no one liked that,
""nerf frost it would be a good idea"" no one liked that,
""nerf the grenade it would be a good idea"" no one liked that
.So could they LISTEN TO THE COMMUNITY.
Just for profit they kill a game that could live a very long life and they changed it from a realistic shooter where you have to learn from errors and become better to a run'n gun shooter where newbies have just to swing first to have the kill cuz the servers are trash. No learning is needed now and you just have to play a very long time without getting better to be champions with ranked2.0.
what a shame.
For now 4 season the top north america champions are cheaters.
what a shame.
ONLY when they loose money they move their asses.
Ubisoft is a shame.
It's been a long time since I appreciated a game from them. They should close and let others take their place in the gaming industry.
I don't even know why I am still on this game. Maybe I'm hopping for things to change like a spark who guide lost souls but in this case it is vain.
What a shame.
Maybe they could listen and the community when they litterally BOO you when you announce a changement. But no they prefer to be blind and deaf like the ""this is fine"" dog.
What a shame.I will always love this game but not what it became and not the company behind it.
Now I only play it hoping something is gonna be better.
The story of the game could be a horrific movie about someone falling really down and torturing people when he want to help them.
what. a. shame.",4,10

metacritic,gibberish1254,tom-clancys-rainbow-six-siege,"Rainbow six siege is a multiplayer first person shooter that combines gun skill and tactics into one. The game is a realistic FPS game that focuses on tactics and teamwork to win as the one-shot headshot feature means tactics are needed to have an advantage over your opponents. The realism of gun play can take away from the tactical side as whichever player shoots first will win meaning tactics may not be needed if you have good aim. This game is heavily focused on multiplayer and lacks a single player side so it may not be everyone's first choice of game. The graphics and sound can be stunning at times but may be lacking at other times leading to a mixed feeling about the game's atmosphere as most walls or floors can be destroyed leading to sound being harder to recognize and the source being unknown, this can cause errors in the game and make people not enjoy the game. Siege is a game with a very high skill ceiling which can discourage newer players as I can be hard to pick up and master but is very rewarding when you do master certain aspects of the game. There is a high skill ceiling is due to the many ways to play the game with 66 playable operators each with their own abilities and playstyles, this makes it hard to learn how to play the game but also allows for everyone to play with the playstyle of their choosing. Although the game sounds great on the surface there can be a lot of bugs, especially after updates, leading to issues with the gameplay, the moderation of cheaters in the game can be poor at times leading to lots of games being ruined by cheaters. This discourages players as it can take weeks sometimes for moderation to ban the cheaters, this is especially common on console and can be hard to detect leading to cheaters not getting banned for weeks or months.",6,10

metacritic,Mr_Rex,tom-clancys-rainbow-six-siege,"Rainbow Six Siege, commonly referred to as “Rainbow Six” and “Siege”, is a highly strategic first-person shooter that relies on teamwork more than anything else. 

Siege has two teams, Attackers who are trying to breach the sites and plant a Defuser and defenders who are trying to prevent the attackers from entering the site. Each team has 5 players who attempt to enter site using strategy and skill using a variety of operators with unique abilities like the different agents in Overwatch or Valorant. Defenders have 32 operators to pick from to prevent the attackers from breaching site, similarly, Attackers also have 32 different operators to pick from to try and breach into site however no operator can be picked twice so character selection requires some strategy to ensure victory.

Rainbow six siege’s destructible maps makes it difficult for attackers, as it means there’s many different possible angles for defenders to be making information crucial to win. Attackers during the prep round have access to drones which they can use to scout the site to locate defenders’ positions while defenders can re-enforce soft walls so they can become impenetrable to bullets and non-penetrating explosives. In terms of game-play, the game is close to a 10/10 and a must buy considering its price of £16.99. 

Ubisoft offers many different cosmetics in siege. This allows for pay to win skins that are ultra-dark. Similarly, the opposite can happen. Rainbow colored skins means you can stand out leading me to believe cosmetics in a game like siege is not the best idea.",10,10

metacritic,MemoryAlex,tom-clancys-rainbow-six-siege,"Rainbow Six es un gran juego aunque con muchas deficiencias..
Es uno de los títulos que mas eh jugado en toda mi vida y debo de reconocer que dentro de los puntos positivos se encuentra una gran calidad grafica, visualmente es muy bueno desde el uso de colores, los mapas eh incluso el movimiento de los Agentes. 
La jugabilidad también es buena, las armas son cómodas de usar, las habilidades de los personajes convierten a este titulo en algo divertido por la colocación de trampas, rastrear oponentes, etc. 

Sin embargo hay varios puntos negativos, comenzando por la aparición de hackers, los cuales si bien no es muy frecuente encontrarlos pues existen...otro punto negativo es que a pesar de que el Juego ya tiene que ser comprado, tienes que desbloquear a los agentes... ya sea con monedas del juego o con dinero real y es en esta parte donde se llega a sentir Pay To Win porque si bien la moneda del juego la consigues jugando es en cantidades muy bajas y varios de los agentes cuestan entre 15k, 20k o hasta 25k de puntos, orillándote a que si quieres conseguirlos mas rapido debes meter dinero real, ya sea para comprar a los agentes o duplicadores que te ayudan a ganar mas fama (la moneda gratis). 

Otro punto que no me gusto fueron las partidas Competitivas, hace no mucho realizaron un cambio en donde dentro de estas partidas se te puede emparejar con jugadores de cualquier medalla, si tu eres cobre (la medalla mas baja) te puede tocar contra un Esmeralda o cualquier otro rango muy alto arruinando por completo la experiencia",7,10

The idea of droning ahead for intelligence and team calling and scouting is great. I absolutely loved the idea that even with bad aim, you can do well on a team.

Seasonal updates have allowed it to last a long time and maintain a solid player base. The graphics are not the most modern, although the said updates have allowed for some rejuvenating tweaks. The controls and mechanics work, allowing ample mobility, which is also quite intuitive. The story, being a game based on online multiplayer, is absent, but that's okay. The defect of all games of this genre is and remains habit. Abandoning it for a few months, or a year, could blow the player away once he takes it back. The various non-competitive modes help to a certain extent in this.
However, it remains one of the most successful and popular Tom Clancy's chapters, also for the scalability of levels and, above all, for personal skill, which remains the best way to get some satisfaction with this Ubisoft title.

metacritic,indiesuckup,tom-clancys-rainbow-six-siege,"Note: This review will only cover multiplayer content.

If you're looking for a break from the run of the mill fast paced first person shooter this is the game for you. It combines a wide array of operators with unique abilities and weapons with tactical gameplay which rewards good positioning, gadget use and game sense. The game has plenty of unique mechanics including one-shot headshots, the lack of a jump button and incredibly destructible environments but the one that makes the game different from its competitors are the drones and cameras. It allows players that are dead to contribute by pinging enemies or making callouts. The base gameplay is well thought out and surprisingly deep. Every match can play out in millions of different ways. However this game has what I like to call an ""Overwatch problem"" where players are forced into playing a certain way in order to win, some operators are incredibly powerful like ash, ace, jäger or mute and others are incredibly situational or next to useless like glaz, nökk, warden or wamai. Some objective sites are very easy to defend, and  others are almost impossible. Ubisoft also seems to have no idea how to use there time because despite some maps being in desperate need of a rework (Theme Park, Kanal and ****) they decide to rework outback, one if the better maps in the game. If this concept was in the hands of a more competent game studio it could be one of the best shooters of all time, but instead we have to deal with Ubisoft fumbling yet another golden opportunity.",7,10

People who are fans of games like Call of Duty number 24 however may find little enjoyment in this game, it is meant to be a slower paced shooter so there is little run and gun viability.

The only problem I have with this game is the direction the developers are taking the operators (The playable characters). Ubisoft has rolled out many operators who are terrible for competitive play on release, who make the experience feel much less about skill and something akin to a hero shooter like Overwatch with abilities taking the forefront. With examples being Lion being released with literal near uncounterable  wallhacks in high level play, Ela having an absurd stun and the most broken gun in siege history, Melusi, Ying, The newest addition Thunderbird and ace to name a few, all had absurd power in my opinion.

Great gameplay with destructible environments, but the direction shifts away from anything remotely similar to counter-terror units, and contain fictitious weapons such as the Scorpion EVO S1 Carbine that should be only semi auto (only the SMG variant has a fire select)

This game is not noob-friendly, contains a ton of cheaters on PC, people who use keyboard and mouse on console, and glitchers that will abuse a glitch until mid-season patches.

The microtransactions are vast and have a lot of diversity, while containing systems that are obsolete for 2020 standards, on top of a paywall entry, and lack of operators with the standard version... they basically force you spend at least $180 if you want any chance at winning from a brand new account's perspective.

metacritic,DragonulX,counter-strike-2,"Description:This game, unlike the rest of the games I reviewed, does not even deserve a concrete review.I played the game from 2014 to 2020, I was also a professional player in a team where I was a co-founder of the team in which my friends participated.I took VAC on my account 3 times unfairly without using it and not even looking for cheats or illegalities for the game. I lost an approximate amount of $200 on all the accounts on which I took VAC, and a time investment of 4 or 5000 hours. I tried to submit a ticket to Steam Support, and no one could help me with anything because the Steam policy is filthy garbage and for people who have VAC on their account, we are people with 0 tolerance for the Steam community. That's why I planned to sue Steam for the lost money and especially for a good part of my childhood lost on a game that I would never want to hear about at the moment.
- Cheaters in every match
- Russians
- Toxic
- Servers that are not deleted for inactivity
- Children who don't know how to play at my level
- People who threaten you with death or with the deletion of your account on your personal profile
- Trust factor is an ordinary mess and there should never be such a thing- Don't look for players according to my rank
- Desert Eagle is the worst designed weapon on the engine side that I have seen.
- Hit box in general is much too disabled to match the bullet with the weapon.
- Don't put updates in the game that make major changes for the game, instead when you put updates in the game, do it in such a way as to get more money
- The people who have unlocked overwatch and those who give a positive review to the game are cheaters who want to protect other cheaters being their own people (The dumbest move a society can make with a game)
- The game's anti-cheat is said to be cabbage. I don't think I have to explain why. But for the people who want to get into the game, please let the game die.
- The CS:GO championships have started to attract professional people, as even the good ones use cheats
- The skins in the game are phenomenally expensive and no one even knows what. I played games with skins that were 100x cheaper than the ones on CS:GO, and they were a masterpiece unlike the garbage they throw at players for $9000",0,10

The shooting mechanics look like they were taken straight from a mobile game. ● The online multiplayer is terrible with garbage matchmaking. There are many bugs and glitches.

Counter-Strike 2, just like its predecessors, is a no frills, back-to-basics, multiplayer FPS that's hugely popular and it's free. So, there's really nothing preventing you from giving it a try.I'm however already bored with it.

metacritic,sakalipsa,dota-2,"Throughout history, there have been numerous moments where discoveries embody the ""perfect formula"" principle, whether it's fire, the wheel, electricity, Coca-Cola... All of these discoveries or inventions are inherently part of a continuum of refinement driven by civilization's evolving needs through time and space. For example, Chess was played thousands of years ago with unlimited time per move, each piece had very different movement rules and overall rules differed significantly from modern ****, the ""perfect formula"" of Chess itself remains unchanged and will likely endure as long as our cognitive 'modus operandi' remains as it is. To put it more illustratively, these ""perfect formula"" discoveries and objects resonate with us much like corners resonate with spiders or trees and rivers resonate with beavers. Our minds are wired to engage with these perfect circuits in all their brilliance, because the human mind is a brilliant invention of evolutionary processes and this engagement is simply enjoyable wallowing in our own **** such perfect circuit, among many others in different fields, is Dota 2. This game is flawless in its **** course, you would make a logical mistake in qualitatively comparing Chess with the wheel, or fire with Coca-Cola, or electricity with Dota 2, or even Chess with Dota 2 - which is usually the case. Each of these phenomena holds its own utility field, and their disparate, incommensurable states should be considered within their own contexts and frameworks. Chess and Dota 2 may have superficial similarities, but they are fundamentally different, like ""original Cola"" VS ""DIY Fanta"" different, the only similarity might be the carbonated bubbles in both drinks, which metaphorically could resemble your mental engagement through all aspects of being tricky, witty, or cunning in strategizing and anticipating moves of your opponent in Chess, or timing your spells in Dota 2 either alone or in synergy with your... ****, yes, THE TEAM. Damn. This sounds like it's always the same team and holy f, it actually is. The game has SO MANY players and has been out there for so long that it has crystallized a distinct pattern of mentality, which could literally be captured by the term ""Team of Dota 2"" with its own hypostatized face. The community in this game deserves special attention; it is a phenomenon that needs a separate review. Actually, it deserves a psycho-pathological study. It's no joke. It's unlike anything I've encountered in any online game before and I'm not using now personal experience (or lack thereof) as a validating instrument for this opinion - it's an objective fact, especially in recent times where its collective mind has reached its peak form.Anyway, back to the game, some surrounding aspects: I've seen many people discredit it, saying things like, ""Damn, that game seems complex and time-consuming; I don't have the energy to invest in it."" Yet they proceed to play Sudoku or Chess 24/7, others invest time in watching bare-bottom TV shows, some work and provide for their families, others gamble, others read books, etc... Everyone is occupied with something, but the 'rational' fear of this game persists, as if it's a virus that will devour their life like nothing else already does. This perception is completely distorted and based on faulty assumptions. As I said, the game is perfect in its core, and that ""perfect formula"" allows you to enjoy it endlessly...HOWEVER, THIS DOES NOT MEAN you should sacrifice your personality, abandon your character and dreams just to immerse yourself in this sinkhole. I mean, if you're confused about your priorities and lack essential personal values, that's your own weakness and fault. It's not the game's fault if you're inclined to start compensating for that weakness with a dominance-at-all-costs attitude in the game - initially just trying to win every match, and later becoming hyper-toxic towards others. Would you blame a beer company for your careless driving while drunk, or a casino for losing enormous amounts of money?

If you are already individually dissociated and dissolved into the crystallized Dota 2 mentality, of course you would. Noob.

metacritic,LT_Gruber,dota-2,"Great game, but too hard and chaotic for me.

I liked Dota 2. It’s mechanics, variation and tension is a unique concept and I enjoyed it very much. I especially liked it’s balance.

In Dota 2, two teams, each up to 10 players, battle it out on a map. Their goal is to destroy the “Ancient” of the other team. This is a large, bulky structure. Each team can choose their own unique hero, 4 skills and choose if they want to play a support character or an attack character.

The attack character specializes in damage and destruction, while the support character focusses on healing, buffs and utilizations. At the start of each match, a little time is given to the players in the team to discuss tactics.

Along the way to the enemy base, various monsters spawn on the road. This monsters do not attack until you do first. They drop currency, which a player can use to buy items in the various little shops around the map. There are also some boss monsters, which drop special items, some of which can increase damage, allow a resurrection and much more.

The graphics in Dota 2 are nice and colorful. The environments on the maps are detailed and full of life and although simple, it has a certain charm. The only problem for me with the graphics, are the various effects of magic, explosions, hits, elemental attacks that blast in your screen during heavy combat, making me lose overview of the situation sometimes.

The sound and ambient music is great and adds to the experience. When **** hits the fan, it can be a little chaotic, but overall, nothing to complain here.

The mechanics, menu’s and action bars are a little confusing and need some time to get used to. The learning curve is a little steep here, and some training matches are certainly recommended. The way the game is supposed to be played (with the right tactics that is), takes even longer and in the beginning, many noob mistakes will be made. Certain items are used in the wrong moment, certain skills have been used too early, that kind of stuff.

Like mentioned, the best part of Dota 2, is its balance. Every player has equal chance of winning. If a player is stronger than you, or kills you with two hits, it is probably because they risked their lives while getting some unique items from monsters on the road. The magic attacks drain mana, which recharges over time. This way, the game prevents spamming the same attack multiple times, keeping it fair.

I liked Dota 2 and it’s mechanics a lot better than League of Legends. There is more balanced gameplay, more tactics (in my opinion) and, because you play in teams, there is more coordination and teamwork.

The only problem, and reason, I stopped playing, is (once again) my lack of skill with this kinds of games. I do like them, and surely want to try them out, however, this kind of intense, fast and “professional” games are not for some hours of relaxation. So in the end, I just cherished the few happy memories I had with this game and moved on.

In terms of gameplay, mechanics and overall feel however, I would certainly recommend this game.",8,10

Indeed, it is a game that immensely delights me, melting in the mouth like the culinary creation of a Michelin-starred chef. And the AI incorporated into it? Well, I must admit, its sophistication always astounds me when it pairs me and my ""certainly"" English-speaking teammates **** is quite astonishing that in this era of technological marvel, which Dota 2 undeniably represents, artificial intelligence has still not found a way to interpret the ""Western Europe"" and ""English"" filters so that the outcome matches these settings. As I nobly select these options, I expect to immerse myself in an English-speaking utopia, where each match becomes an oasis of British etiquette and Shakespearean exchange of courtesies. Instead, I often find myself as an unintended guest at a Cyrillic party, where communication is composed of mysterious runes and enigmatic pictograms.I cannot help but wonder if my client is inadvertently a window for the expansion of Russian influence, where every keyboard, regardless of chosen language preferences, is secretly programmed to convert everything into the letters of the Cyrillic alphabet. And I think to myself, oh, how charming, how insightful of Valve to provide me with cultural enrichment without my explicit consent. Indeed, how far can free education go?What an amazing school of patience and interpersonal skills, when this game guides me to mumble phrases in Russian that I've learned amidst the waves of ""cyka blyat"". Dota 2 is not just a game, but also a language course and a social experiment that broadens my horizons far beyond the usual limits.

metacritic,MemoryAlex,dota-2,"Fue el Primer MOBA en existir y también se conserva como el mejor en calidad.
Para empezar gráficamente este titulo es muy bonito porque cuenta con una adecuada combinación de colores y realismo (aunque un poco mas enfocado a lo gris y realista). 
La jugabilidad es de las mas completas que me eh encontrado porque cada héroe cuenta con habilidades divertidas que pueden provocar un gran impacto en las partidas, al igual que los items, los cuales son un gran complemento para incluirte mas habilidades como invisibilidad, inmovilizar, volar, teletransportarte, no se quedaron únicamente con efectos pasivos, sino que, fueron mas haya. 
Además de que en este se presentan mecánicas que nunca eh visto en otros del genero como el poder destruir a tus aliados o estructuras... además de ser de los pocos juegos Online en todo el mundo donde puedes Pausar. 
El Mapa es posiblemente el mas grande dentro de los MOBA, pero eso no es un problema y tampoco se vuelve tedioso jugarlo. 
Existen mas de 100 personajes jugables y a diferencia de los otros en este genero, el DOTA te da a estos heroes totalmente gratis, no necesitas gastar monedas del juego ni dinero real en conseguirlos. 
Si le quieres meter dinero a este titulo es completamente opcional ya sea para SETS o el DOTA Plus el cual es un gran complemento que te aconseja en que héroes puedes jugar o que items puedes usar, etc.

Tal vez dentro de lo negativo siendo realistas es su comunidad extremadamente toxica y que en actualizaciones se siente muy pausado... cada actualizacion de verdad vale mucho la pena pero siempre **** en meter Heroes Nuevos, algun evento, etc.

metacritic,JellyMan_33,dota-2,"I've got a solid couple thousand hours, here's what I would say after watching the game over the last decade or so.

Visuals:  Game looks great and performs great, even today its visuals are actually pretty rock solid!

Sound:  Music is fantastic, sound effects are also spot on!  Voiced characters sound great.

Gameplay:  If you can put in the time, and have enough friends to play with, this can be one of the greatest gaming experiences available!   The downside, it takes an immense amount of time to know whats going on and the characters, even after hundreds of hours its a constant stream of learning and adapting.   Even if you get to know all the characters the game changes and gets updated all the time, so its hard if you're not current.    Overall some good and bad here, one they have a dev that looks out after the game.  But some might say they've made way too many changes and maybe have focused too much on a massive hero pool.   It's definitely one of the more daunting games to get into if you're new.  If you are competitive and like team-based strategy that requires communication this is elite.   Again, some of the best possible gaming experience you can have here.

Buttttttt......   also some of the worst, as it goes with MOBAS, the community is toxic.   People get frustrated, specially if you're new.  A game can take from 30-60 minutes id say 45 is pretty typical, so people get mad.   You can mute all you want but the game is not the same without a team and comms.   It's best if you got a 5 stack of friends to play with.

While it does have some great moments, it also is bogged down by a toxic community and wildly steep learning curve.",7,10

Its like comparing COD and Battlefield, they are so different that can not be compared. Give this game a try, the learning curve is very steep but it is rewarding when you learn.

metacritic,Ciocolici,dota-2,"Dota 2, to me, stands as the best, most complex, addicting, rewarding, and polished MOBA out there. However, my relationship with the game has been tumultuous due to its community, prompting me to quit in 2014-2015 (after Techies' hero launch). Recently, in 2022, I decided to give it another shot and returned to the battlefield, totaling around 4k hours across my accounts.

The game itself is a masterpiece, boasting intricate mechanics and well-crafted gameplay. Yet, it is plagued by one significant drawback—the Dota 2 community. Within its player base, you'll find individuals who refuse to communicate in English, spammers, and those who feed intentionally due to petty disagreements about lane assignments. Toxicity is a common occurrence, particularly in unranked matches, although ranked play varies depending on your rank.

Before diving into Dota 2, it's crucial to consider this aspect of the community. However, if you can endure the toxic encounters, you'll discover a game that truly shines with its skill-dependent gameplay. Mastering Dota 2 takes time and dedication, and new players will likely feel overwhelmed by the vast amount of knowledge to absorb. Yet, with perseverance, you'll grasp the intricacies and improve over time.

One of the game's standout features is its excellent free-to-play business model. All gameplay content, including heroes, modes, and the arcade, is accessible for free. However, Dota 2 monetizes through cosmetics and battle passes, which offer a plethora of cosmetics and rewards earned through grinding. It's important to exercise caution here; while cosmetics add a nice touch to the game, excessive spending on them can quickly escalate. To get the most value for your money, consider purchasing cosmetics from the marketplace rather than opening chests.

One particular feature that I find bothersome is the Dota Plus subscription. While it offers some helpful in-game suggestions, it veers into the territory of pay-to-win elements, which detracts from the game's competitive integrity. Moreover, they lock player progression behind the subscription, stopping heroes' progression to level 5 for non-subscribers. Progression is a fundamental aspect of gaming, and gating it behind a subscription is an unnecessary inconvenience.

Despite these drawbacks, Dota 2 remains an exceptional game at its core, offering an unparalleled MOBA experience. Just be prepared to face the challenges presented by its community, and you'll find a deeply rewarding and engaging gaming journey ahead.",9,10

However it seams Valve wasn't happy with Dota`s loyal fan base giving them a lot of $, so directors decided they need to attract hots and lol players. Thus came patch 7.00 ruining Dota forever. Now Dota 2 is no longer Dota. All competitive factors are lost and its greatness is lost due to greed. Small example; player HUD used to be same size for all heroes, now it changes from hero to hero covering more or less screen space thus making it unequal.

metacritic,richy2383,league-of-legends,They don't do anything about toxic players and the only changes they make are ones that existing players hate. No change on how they address trolls in games and end up punishing the players that actually try. Avoid this game at all costs,0,10
metacritic,MArcleos,league-of-legends,"Riot Games is a company that pretends to understand its own games, but the reality is completely different. Every update feels like it was made by people who have never actually played their own game. The balancing is completely random, matchmaking is a disaster, and the LP/MMR system in Teamfight Tactics is completely broken.Instead of fixing fundamental issues, they keep adding new features that only make things worse. Player feedback? Completely ignored. Communication? Almost nonexistent. If you look at their track record, you’ll see that they keep making the same mistakes over and over without ever learning from **** you’re looking for fair games made by a competent development team, you’re in the wrong place. Riot Games only cares about profits and couldn’t care less about their players.",0,10

metacritic,KhanTheRewiever,league-of-legends,"No matter what anyone else says league is a game that survived more than a decade now and it still has one of the biggest communities, game is good, sometimes it may be unballanced but riot balances things at most in a few weeks. Currently riot did some bad changes about skins and in-game currency but that will probably also be fixed in near future.

community is ussualy toxic and unforgiving, like you cant make mistakes you have to be perfect to appeal them and sometimes even being perfect isnt enough so the game is not only about your skill but also your mindset as well, its drenching

reason why this game survived this long is probably because of its uniqueness there are +160 characters and everygame you are playing is a different combination of champs and objectives like dragons etc. you also have to change your build and sometimes skill upgrades for this reason as well.",9,10
metacritic,ruslaneeee,league-of-legends,"A game that requires, you to invest money so you can play characters, the “it's in-game currency, you can save up for any character” style argument goes **** it, if you're used to eating **** then keep doing it.

metacritic,Nasus_Tumbado,league-of-legends,"Lamentablemente, la cultura de esports en LAN no es la mejor, sino la peor junto con su contraparte del sur, y las estadísticas en eventos internacionales lo confirman, esto se debe a más factores de la toxicidad en ese servidor y del autosabotaje que muchos miembros practican por simples actos de odio. En mis tiempos de jugador desde Season 6 eh notado que la compañía cada vez menos busca intensificar los estándares de justicia al jugador que está comprometido por competir. Enfocando su esfuerzo en mejorar el contenido estético y crear sistemas de loot por azar. Generalmente el juego puede ser mejor pero debido a decisiones de la compañía y así mismo los despidos masivos hacen que esa oportunidad cada vez esté más lejos de ser realidad.",4,10

metacritic,QRD,league-of-legends,"Riot just manipulates people to keep playing their game using petty events and skins, while this company doen't even care about its players. The only thing that matters for riot is money, just like every company. And of course the matchmaking system is unfair and unbalanced. You either play a very easy game or you play with teamates whose skill level is four times lower than our enemies. Six times in a row i was the best on the team and we somehow lost all those times. The game has become ""who will get one shotted first"". And I also have seen videos of League's  toxic community and i have to say that this game destroys people's mental sanity. And if Riot considers that to resolve all those problems is to mute chat or gambling system, Riot has failed to make a fun non-toxic video game. If riot decides to offer its players a fresh atmosphere in their game i will continue playing",4,10

Jeu free to play et absence quasi totale d'éléments pay to win (quelques skins peuvent être avantageux sans pour autant être insupportable). En revanche, le jeu souffre d'un nombre excessif de smurfs, de comptes achetés, botés... et le système de bannissement laisse à désirer.

metacritic,turmerocentro,league-of-legends,"Honestly, this game is plagued of Scripters/cheaters, neither one of my reports are being take it seriously, I enjoyed playing when learning, but once you understand the champs, I am minimum mastery level 5 on each one of them, so I know what I’m saying, i ended up catching the Cheaters, Vanguard the anti-cheating system doesn’t works, they make fun of it. The matchmaking, is a manipulative system, that allows you winning or be defeated, for example, you are god with your main champ, the system match you with newbies players whilst the enemy team are all high ranked players, there isn’t a 5v5, it is a 1v5, it’s unfair, reason why i left the ranked mode, their own statistics show that just 20% players do ranked mode.THERE’S NO COMPETITION !the only way to enjoy that game is with 5 friends, that fend the unfair matchmaking act against **** game is a good game, handled wrong, and that ruins **** MOTHER ALWAYS SAID TAKE ADVICES TO ADVANCE, MY ADVICE IS ….Don’t try this, unless you have a bunch of good friends players.",0,10

Seems like coincidence to me, those are the kinds of amazing actions Riots genious system commits while they blame the ""players"" for the toxicity.  The game client is older than jesus itself and god forbid riot spend any of their hard earned scam money to give the players a new game client.  Riot also will overtune champions to push skin sells, then after skin promotion has ended they will nerf said champion into the ground.  If you want to play a game ran by coinslot eyed scumbags, this might be the game for you.",0,10

I have been playing games since 1985, I literally played the first commercial console ever created all the way till today, literally played every console out there and owned most of them, so when I talk about games, I know what I am talking **** the history of gaming, there was never a game that had to shut down its forums because of how toxic its community is. And there is not an online game that I know of which rewards mentally ill children by adding more ranks backwards like they did with ""iron rank"". I am very serious when I tell you that this game's community is THE BEST environment to study the psychological mental illnesses as you will meet the most damaged people in the word there. So...

-If you want to meet creatures that have 0 IQ? 
-If  you want a proof that some people are still apes?
-If  you want a great psychology case study to prove that this generation is mentally unstable and is mentally destroyed?
-If  you want to meet developers who don't give a **** about how their game is known for being THE most toxic gaming community on earth as long as their users are giving them their money?

Well, you chose the right game!

A couple of friends now have been trying to figure out how in the world you would get either 4 human donkeys or pro players, there isn't a middle ground. We figured out that what happens is that you will get say to Iron 3 as an example, they will keep putting you on the smurf team all the way to reach iron 1 with 98 points. One you reach there, they will then put you on human donkey team all the way to iron 4 with 0 points. Then that is when they will put you again with the smurfs non stop till you reach iron 1 with 98 again. We have tried it and recorded it, it is confirmed. The reason they do that is to get you hooked with some hopes that you will get of whatever your league is and then put you with human donkeys to 0 you back to the start and in your head you are thinking ""I almost made it"" So you keep playing. It is basically a **** mouse trap.",0,10

metacritic,NamiMain,league-of-legends,"ive been playing for 15 years so of course i enjoy the game but it's bad. it could be so much better with real match matching. it doesnt matter how good you are, it's all random. this makes it so bad players can get carried higher and good players can get placed lower, so no matter what rank you are the games are unbalanced. After years of the same system riot thinks punishing the team as a whole is the answer while trolls, grievers, tilters, autofilled, disconnects(+rage quits), smurfs, and bad players exists in nearly every game in some form or another, often times multiples of any combinations of the above. You just have to hope your combination is better than the enemies, hence the randomness. Player's skill level are so all over the place that it creates unfun unsatisfying wins and unfun unwinnable games. In my emerald games it feels like im laning with an adc that's never even used a mouse and keyboard before and trying league for the first time. They dont know how to smoothly control their character, they dont know how to combo their abilities correctly, they don't move in between autos, cant cs, they have no sense that someone is about to shoot a skill shot at them, and they have no sense when to fight even when they have both summoner's up and someone's engaging, in EMERALD rank! These are just some of the basics they should easily be able to auto pilot just from getting to 30 to play ranked. Yet some how they dont and yet some how they are the same rank as me. they have 0 sense of danger and 0 skill to do anything. it's kinda crazy ive been playing this game for 15 years and i get matched with baby's first league game. This is not a rare occurrence either, and not just with the adc. many of my team mates struggle in my elo like they've never played a match in their life before. I also watch A LOT of twitch challenger players and sure 1% of the challenger players are actually challenger, but the rest are just as garbage as my team mates. so why am i even trying to climb when the games in higher elos dont even look any less random or any more enjoyable then what im experiencing now. so queing up and climbing is pretty much gambling on a slot machine especially as a solo que support main. riot is completely okay with everybody calling each other trash and wasting everyone's time all because of their poor quality match made games. nobody is actually ranked where they should be except maybe 1% of people. the more time you have to grind games, the more youll climb. not the better you get, the more you grind. as a side note ive stopped spending money on this game 8-10 years ago solely based on the fact riot doesnt deserve it. id rather set my 10 bucks on fire than give it to riot for a skin. once i find a game to replace league im gone for good, supervive and even heroes of the storm seem like better options at the moment.",0,10

1. No more original devs, who made this game successful and popular, like Morello and Gunsoo. Right now it's just a mess

2. At early times devs atleast made intentions to fix balance, like it should be in every game, especially with competition. With time passed, it turned into bad dev habit of making changes for the sake of changes, adding more and more unbalanced garbage without even intention to fix previous mess they made.

3. Toxic community. And devs refusing to adress problems connected to it. Like banning people for saying mean words, even when they can be muted, and ignoring griefing and intentionally feeding cases. The most ridiculous thing is that you can be banned for flaming griefer or inter, while they will still be unbanned

4. Original LoL had different classes with different roles, they took that system from original Dota and that's what hooked me. Now it's just a mess anyway. Over time they just kept adding more gold, damage and CDR to everyone turning the game from something like tactical chess and mindgames during lining phase, into League of oneshots and Fortnite-like gameplay: fast-paced oneshot simulator especially if you play with glass cannon type of class.

The only aspects that make the game remotely interesting are the graphics and the skill tree. The regular mobs on the maps are generally no challenge at all. Bosses simply spam countless AOE attacks and throw trash mobs at you. There’s no noteworthy mechanic or significant challenge behind the boss fights. They just deal massive damage and have an endless health pool. When it’s supposed to be “especially difficult,” the boss room is artificially shrunk until you’re forced to fight an AOE-spamming boss in a tiny square, or they use damage types against which it’s nearly impossible to have sufficient **** 1 is far more entertaining and enjoyable to play.

Drop rates are insanely low and will drop gear for all classes which makes getting any upgrade for your class very hard to come by.

Level ups feel worthless as STR, DEX, INT no longer provide major stat improvements. Skills no longer level up. The only character they seem to have balanced the game around is the Warrior, ever other class dies so quickly it's not funny.

Performance wise the game stutters a lot and floats between 40-50 FPS with a 2080 on medium.

I'm so tired of devs labelling their game dank souls because they are too lazy to balance their game and then to top it off throwing in instant death attacks to further ruin the game.

After trying for a few days, I’ve had enough. My previous comments were already polite, but now I have to tell it like it is. First of all, not only does the game completely fail to responsibly teach the mechanics, but the company behind it is utterly **** entire game is designed to work against the player. The map mods always target the players’ weaknesses (and they dare to call this a sense of achievement—it's an insult to the players!). There's a 10% experience penalty, only five portals, and the skill tree, which seems expansive at first glance, is a total lie. Skill Gems? Whether they're usable or not entirely depends on the developers’ whims!This garbage game is as repulsive as Blizzard. With a company like this, I seriously doubt that their upcoming PoE2 will be good game.
- Sep 9, 2024
Overall, the game cannot be considered poor; however, it is undeniably frustrating and infuriating.First, the game features a highly complex system. Unfortunately, many explanations of the game mechanics are provided through player-created websites, such as those detailing skill trees and equipment crafting, rather than being offered directly by the developers. The developers should have provided instructional resources to guide players on crafting equipment and understanding skill trees and their combinations. Instead, the official game website remains unchanged and simplistic, while the game’s mechanics continue to grow increasingly complex. Consequently, only players with an in-depth understanding of the game’s mechanics and calculations are able to excel, leaving newcomers at a loss, forced to rely on **** game’s content is inherently challenging, and with experience penalties upon character death and limitations on late-game map access. new players have no choice but to depend on player-created websites for game information. Unfortunately, these sites often lack the latest updates and sometimes contain outdated information. For an internationally promoted game, the language barrier further exacerbates the issue, making it even more difficult for new and returning players to access comprehensive game information and mechanics. These are aspects that the game developers should have addressed, but they have yet to take any action in this regard.finally, I think this game company is most likely to be of the same nature as Blizzard, so don’t have high expectations.Finally, regarding the experience penalty and my personal feeling, when the character is about to level up by the amount of experience (approximate experience: 50% or more), there will always be monsters that can kill the character immediately in the map, this phenomenon will always occur regardless of the difficulty of the map, and then 10% of the experience points that have been worked hard to increase are forcibly deducted, and all the time invested is wasted in this phenomenon.",1,10
metacritic,SpaceGhosto,path-of-exile,"One of the best games ever made. Best modern ARPG for **** a constructive criticism I would say there is a bit of bloat related to game mechanics, it has accumulated over the years.

If you are going to try PoE for the first time or want to return to it and give it another try, just take your time and do what you find interesting it's going to be enjoyable no matter how deep you want to delve into it.
PoE is the true Diablo 2 successor.",10,10
metacritic,CnPx98,path-of-exile,"1, if not the best ARPG around today. And it's free, with no P2W Micro-transactions. Path of Exile (POE) is such an awesome experience that is difficult to pull yourself away from, after getting hooked. Every last detail has been thought out. Even those smallest quality of life improvements, that normally get glossed over, have been solved in a way that make the user experience better. Then all of these little improvements together, just make the game feel so natural and smooth to play. 
So the best part of ARPGs is the character building freedom, and that is where POE really stands out from the croud. The developers at Grinding Gear Games have really made every single style feel like the possibilties are endless. This has came at the cost of the new player experience feeling overwhelming. So if you are new, I recommend copying someone else's build for your first character. This will allow you to become familier with the massive skill tree before tackling your own build.
Campaign wise the game is fairly sized. How ever I personally never took much interest in the story and lore. But the gameplay is so good that it didn't bother me that I didn't have a clue what was going on. I have heard from fans that the story is really good if you bother to learn it. But my ADHD doesn't allow me to listen to a voice over the top of a text dump for each part of the game narration. Its like Audible but your looking at a screen with nothing intersting going on.
The enemy and boss mechanics are the best you can experience in ARPGs. With enemy attacks being well telegraphed. At times can be quite fast paced. With all sorts of flashing effects that gives you that sweet, sweet dopamine. 
The looting is also fun. Something that Diablo hasn't been able to quite capture since D2. POE makes you feel like no time is ever wasted. The currencies in this game are items to which do various things. Like change item modifiers or gem slots. So even items you don't want can be exchanged to NPCs for some of these currencies. Making everything carry atleast some form of value to the player. Rather then having 1 universal currency, that you end up getting so much of that it ends worthless. 
There is a player trading system. Most people tend to want Chromatic Orbs for items. These orbs changing the colour of gem slots on items. Gem slots are what grant you your abilities which you use in combat.

POE being free. Whats its monitization like? The only thing that you can buy that alters gameplay is stash tabs. These cost around $5 each. There is a variety of different kinds. Other then a currency tab (Allowing you to stack each currency, way higher), you don't really need any of the others, but they are nice to have. You could easily play through the game and get the full experience without dropping a dime. But I personally recommend spending around $20 on a few stash tabs so you don't spend as much time micromanaging your bank.

My 1 gripe with this game. ADD LEG ARMOUR!! All the characters walk around almost half naked. You do get full armour later in the game. But for hours you will be walking around in near enough your underwear, from the waist down. You can get cosmetic overrides, thou. Changing how each slot appears, regardless of what you have equipped. These are on the prices side, I think each bundle is like $30 or something. They do have discount sales on for a selection of stuff. It's more there if you want to show extra support to the team and get a little something in return. It's not ever rammed in your face. Throughout your hole time with the game, you will never get ads pop up asking you to spend money. Only a small button saying ""shop"" which clearly states that it is a microtransaction shop. So you know, this is where you spend real money. 

POE is proof that you don't need malicious or deceptive techniques to be a successful FTP game. You just need to make the experience enjoyable and the money will come. That when developers do these annoying FOMO techniques, that it is out of greed and not because ""They need to or the game will die"". 

If you enjoy ARPGs with fun looting and unlimited character builds then POE is definitely a game for you. And its free so definitely give it a go! The new player experience does have a bit of a learning curve, but I highly recommend sitting through it because once you start getting hooked, you won't regret it.",9,10
metacritic,Jegern,path-of-exile,"The game itself is great, steep learning curve but its great. The devs are great people. 
BUT the support of this game good lord. Dont ever have any kind of problems with this game. If you do you should just stop playing the game.
This game has the WORST support ever, HORRIBLY inefficient and its literally like talking to a braindead AI on the other side. 
I had my account locked and then muted for have a name that they considered inappropriate.
 I repeatedly tried to explain to them the context behind my name and why it was not what they thought it was but they didn't care. 
Its like the person on the other end had a huge ego and simply refused to accept that they may have made a mistake.
Also the account recovery process is the WORST of anything out there. Recovering your account even if you have all of the proof that its your account will take days if not weeks because they have no sort of form for you to fill out. You have to send emails back and forth forever until they can do anything for you.
I am not kidding when i say that EA support is better than this, and i despise EA as a company.",5,10
metacritic,VanVilon,path-of-exile,"I recently started playing the new season of Path of Exile on July 26th and was enjoying the game. I was so excited that I immediately purchased the most expensive supporter pack, spending $90 to support the developers. However, just a few hours later, I was suddenly banned for “3rd party software” (botting). The only other applications I had running were Riot’s client and the Mobalitics app on Overwolf. Neither of these interacted with Path of Exile or made any changes to the **** a complete beginner, I was simply following a leveling guide from Maxroll, trying to learn the game. Despite this, I was banned without any explanation or investigation. The support team refused to look into my gameplay to verify if the ban was justified and only responded with pre-generated, copy-pasted answers. The ban is permanent.

I am not alone in this experience—many others have been banned for no apparent reason:

1. ****/forum/view-thread/3247788
2. ****/forum/view-thread/3240146
3. ****/forum/view-thread/3247169

I am sharing this to warn everyone to be extremely cautious about purchasing any microtransactions from this company. They can revoke your access to the game at any time and for any reason, as outlined in their policy rules. You could be banned for simply having unrelated applications running in the background, even if they have nothing to do with your Path of Exile gameplay.",0,10

So the game is really good, the best thing about it is that it offers a huge, very comprehensive passive skill tree which can make a difference. The game plays great on my PC on max settings, it feels a bit clunky at times but rarely. The game looks pretty good on a good PC especially on areas that are not very dark, the textures are really solid, unfortunately most of the areas I've seen so far are dark and gloomy which it doesn't help for the game look better on modern hardware.Dark is the tone and theme of the game though,a land ravaged of all kinds of horrors. The gameplay is nice with a huge variety of different enemies and spells you can use to destroy them. I am not sure yet if the game is the king of the genre like many people are saying but it sure is a great game, better than Diablo 3, Chaosbane or even victor vran in my opinion. Definitely not better than Hades though they are incredibly different,haven't played Diablo 4 so no opinions there.",8,10
metacritic,Izrakhan,path-of-exile,"Less the game more the company behind it.

I was a customer of theirs from 2013 to 2022. After a very disconnected launch designs starting with 3.15 many of us were upset. We voiced our displeasure with the game changes. We were also routinely muted in chat for very harmless criticisms. Even some nuanced history without being offensive to anyone.

I had enough in 2022. I told them to delete my account after a back and forth with support.

Out of curiosity I saw that Tencent had fully acquired the company. So I thought that perhaps their leadership and attitudes had changed. I was wrong.

I reached out in April 2024 during Necropolis league if they would reinstate all the supporter pack microtransactions associated to the account. The very same email, with the dates and transaction ids of each purchase discussed.

They simply said they couldn't do it. This is just corporate speak. It's not like I asked for a refund on a served dinner or a physical product. These are digital transactions. With proof of purchase. They simply refused.

So you see nothing has changed with them in two years. The way support treats customers is simply the tip of the iceberg. They hate you.

Update: Support got back to me and today fully restored the deleted account. They went the extra mile when they didn't have to. 

So they don't hate us. The future will tell the verdict of GGG. Not the past.",8,10

metacritic,PapaJhn88,path-of-exile,"Max score means I consider it to be the best for its genre. Depth, customization and scale of the end game are like never seen in a game before.  The game  was inspired by Diablo2 and GGG took it to a whole new level. Really feals that the game is made for gamers to enjoy and not for the company to make a profit, they (GGG) go all in with that by keeping a very close relationship with the community and really listening to their feedback.",10,10
metacritic,Game_Guru_81,path-of-exile,"Recap on Path of Exile play, staff and community in 2024 is simply this: Game play is ok but has too many options/paths for a build with confusing & pointless stats in gear & accessories that make building and game play bad, specially End game playing.

STAFF of GGG (was TenCent)  is simply this: The GM's are abusive with muting & banning ppl for minor little things, (Unless your a real old paying player)  then it is ok for them to troll/give wrong info & abuse new players causing them to not want play the game at all.

Reporting abuse to a GM on old players only get you muted for simple little things that DO NOT break the TOS, because if it did they would mute all the players who constantly troll/abuse new players making new ppl not want to bother playing PoE at all.

NOW the Crux of the matter, Community simply is this:  Everything I explained above about players being abusive above is just a fraction of the horror that is PoE,  asking a question or asking for help with making a build result's in being given false information that makes it harder for you to play/build a character, they give info like PoE.ninja which does not help you, they give fake/trash 3rd party program & websites for build's & filters that do not work & waste your time.  But I regress, GGG (was tenCent) does not care about any of that, but if you are new & have ANY kind of opinion/concern trying to help new players you are muted for any little thing as I was muted for 10066 days for my warning of reddit being bad information as I descovered by trying to use it for many things & find only hatefulness/trolling & wrong information.  I tend to be bluntly honest but I never do it in a way that breaks any TOS as they claim it does.. If THAT breaks the TOS then why are ppl allowed to cuss at ppl, insult ppl and troll/abuse give wrong info to ppl messing them up & making them unwelcome??

As toxic chat goes, PoE is worse then WoW (World of Warcraft) LoL (League of legends) combined x 1000 because the GM does not seem to care that they are destroying PoE making there PoE 2 a real waste!

Requires research. In order to play Path of Exile effectively, you need to do a lot of research. This includes reading guides, watching videos, and experimenting with different builds. This can be a lot of work, and it can take away from the fun of the game.
Requires 3rd party guides. It is very difficult to advance in Path of Exile without using 3rd party guides. These guides provide detailed instructions on how to build your character, what skills to use, and what items to equip. This can be helpful, but it can also take away from the discovery aspect of the game.
Could use more in-game guides. Path of Exile is a very complex game, and it would be helpful if there were more in-game guides to help players learn the basics. This would make the game more accessible to new players and would reduce the need for 3rd party guides.

there are just far too many bugs and far too many issues to forgive. the devs seem to have a decent idea of how to write a narrative, and it really grabbed me at first, but the game is just not a finished project.  i feel like a single person could remake it on any basic platform from scratch and easily make it better and more functional, and it doesnt seem like people should still be paying for such a poorly designed beta copy of the game so many years after it's release. this thing should be free, and i'd be asking for a refund if i paid for it.",5,10

metacritic,GameLite,firewatch,"From Campo Santo Studios comes Firewatch, a 2016 award-winning, story based, first person mystery set in Wyoming’s Shoshone National Forest during the year of 1989. You play as Henry, a man in his forties who finds himself taking a role as a fire lookout over the summer. The only source of contact, over the radio, is another fire lookout named Delilah. Over the course of the summer, the relationship between the both, develop and emotions are dug deep. Meanwhile, a fire is raging on, and a mysterious individual is causing trouble. This story-based text choice game offers a really unique experience and can be recommended to anyone who would enjoy that mystery twist added on top.

With this being the first release from Campo Santo Studios, in 2016, it takes the lead with no prequels. It is completely original in its storyline and really is the top of its class for text-choice walking simulators. With no competition, it really is a unique experience to be traversed.

It can become a bit repetitive when walking between areas of the map that you have already explored however, the game leads you through new walking routes which allows you to see the entirety of the forest trails. Firewatch keeps you hooked with suspense and what may happen next, leading the player to be anxious of suspected jump scares and other unexpected events which creates a thrilling adventure.

The game is set in the Wyoming forest at the peak of the summer of 1989, therefore wildfires are at their highest risk. As a fire watcher you complete your tasks that Delilah deals you and these lead you into scenarios and situations that you deal with, sometimes with limited help. As a short game, it is really quite simple as most of the gameplay involves walking and clicking text prompt responses over the radio to Delilah. This simple nature allows you to immerse yourself into the story and take in the environment around you, creating a really immersive and interesting game to playthrough.

Overall, the gameplay lasts between 3-5 hours which for a game can be considered quite short however it is also very affordable which makes up for that factor. The player’s choices will influence and effect the relationship between them (Henry) and Delilah. This adds a minimal sense of replay ability to the game as although it’s possible to explore different outcomes and responses with Delilah, it doesn’t have an effect on the ending of the game so therefore, it only really is a game that you would playthrough a couple of times over a few years.

It has been released digitally on Xbox, PlayStation, Nintendo Switch, Windows, MacOS and Linux and had a short-term limited physical release. Due to the short gameplay time, it is very space efficient for storage. It usually prices about £17, however if brought on Steam, it can be grabbed for around £4 on a Steam Sale which is most definitely worth it despite the shorter play time. 

The graphics and attention to detail are arguably Firewatch’s main attraction points as the scenery and overall art style of this game is beautiful. It has a serious realistic style to it but also incorporates bright colours and utilises time of day-based lighting to portray the effect it wants to the player based off of the mood or time of day. This takes it over the edge compared to other walking-based text-choice games and therefore can be recommended as one of the best games for this popular genre.

The sound and music design makes its debut at key points of the game as it represents the current mood and feeling of the scene. This really enhances the player adventure-experience and highlights specific changes in direction of the story. The atmosphere is also stunning and takes the game to a new level. It immerses the player, and with a good pair of headphones, it really makes you feel like you are out there braving the heat and sprawling pathways of the American forest.

Around launch, it suffered repeated criticisms based off its technical issues, mainly to do with walking mechanics and day progress. However, these were swiftly fixed and an option to restart the current day was added to help prevent these issues from preventing progress. It also does not support multiplayer and most likely never will, due to the plot and age of the game. The plot creates a sense of isolation with the only singular support link being Delilah, therefore any sense of multiplayer will damage the storyline.

Overall, Firewatch is an immersive and thrilling story leading the player to be curious about what will happen next and how the relationship with Delilah will develop. This really feels like a checkpoint game in the way it leaves its mark in your thoughts and ideas, therefore is quite a beautiful game despite it only being a 3–5 hour experience. Campo Santo have outdone themselves with it being there first game and have possibly developed, to be argued, the best story-based walking simulator out there. A definite pickup.",9,10
metacritic,marpado,firewatch,"Um jogo muito bonito visualmente, que oferece bastante em termos de dialogo e construção de relação entre os personagens. A gameplay de walking simulation é bastante contemplativa e se mescla bem com o cenário, mas pode se tornar maçante nos momentos finais do jogo. A narrativa é bem cativante e prende bastante durante a história, mas o plot final não é satisfatório, já que não entrega um ápice emocional que o resto da narrativa merece.",7,10

metacritic,VictorFerreira7,firewatch,"Firewatch is a unique experience that is totally immersive. What holds you to this experience is the story. As far as I know, the Campo Santo's studio was made by two writers from The Walking Dead Season One from Telltale Games. So it explains a lot about good writing. The story is really good. The gameplay is a bit clunky, my experience was bug-free, but sometimes I've gotten stuck in rocks or in the outpost ladder. The soundtrack is good and the sound environment is excellent because the goal of this game is to be immersive. The forest is breathtaking, really relaxing, and beautiful. The negative point of this game? It is too short. Really short. When you bit the game, you wish for more of the story; more about Henry and Delilah, more puzzles, and more suspense. Unfortunately, you won’t get more of it, and we won't have a second game because the developers moved on to another studio. It is disappointing, being we will not have more Firewatch.",8,10
metacritic,THESHAGMAN,firewatch,"Firewatch is a beautiful game and good at what it sets out to do. Unfortunately the gameplay is pretty bad. Go here,go there is pretty much the entirety of the gameplay. And the walking is clunky too. 

The story is short and sweet but I wish there was a bit more fleshing out as a time skip from day 2 to day 70 is a bit mad. It's good but feels too condensed. 

I enjoyed the feeling of tension when it turns into more of a physiological horror. But unfortunately it's mid at the end and explained in a very plain and boring way

metacritic,Rayanghobar,firewatch,"I enjoyed it. The story could easily lose you if you don't empathize or immerse yourself in the characters or the story, or have a hard time doing so. The story kept my interest, it was fun to explore the forest around me- then it lost me. it was tense, it made me nervous, i was anxious to see what happened next- then... it ended. I'm left feeling like there's something i missed, like a second ending, a continuation of events, or some other part of the puzzle, but the puzzle is done, and the piece that's missing was designed to be missing. I bought it like that. Now, that's not necessarily a bad thing. It asked me questions and allowed me to answer them as the character in a way that made sense. It has a lot to say about abandonment, relationships, and mental health. But either way, I'm left with a thought, and that thought is ""It happened too fast."" Even so, i had fun, and I won't pretend like i didn't enjoy my experience. I could see another version of myself not liking the game. And if your the type to not immerse yourself in a game in attempt to take its story seriously, maybe its not for you. As for me? Eh. I enjoyed it well enough. Get it on sale.",7,10

At the beginning I found myself walking what seemed to be an endless landscape, with a map that was hard to see while walking. Then I realised it was the whole point. At first you feel lost and in need to constantly check the map, but soon you learn the paths. It challenged me and my poor sense of orientation, and I can say it improved a little once I finished the game. 
The way the story progressed made me ask myself so many questions about what was real and what not, whatever something was a set up or legit.

It shouldn’t be my thing. Very story driven walking simulators aren’t usually for me. But I picked it up one day on Xbox game pass because I thought the cover art was pretty. I was up til 4am that night finishing the game because I simply could not put it down. I don’t know if I’ve ever been as absorbed in the story **** as I was with Firewatch. The dialogue is the best I’ve ever read. The music is fantastic. The visuals are gorgeous. I was on the edge of my seat trying to see where the story would go. Sure, the ending disappointed me, but to me it doesn’t negate the journey to get there. Overall, very few games have ever stuck with me like Firewatch has, and I think that’s the marker of a truly great game.",9,10
metacritic,ChimeraRising,firewatch,"I went into this game completely blind, knowing nothing more than I liked the aesthetic. What a great decision that turned out to be. Firewatch has a genuinely intriguing story that captivates you much like an A list thriller movie does. The story in itself took me about 3 1/2 hours to complete and every minute of that was enjoyable. I look forward to watching my friend play it to see what dialogue interactions he encounters that my differ from mine.

The visuals are absolutely gorgeous, the gameplay is fluid and smooth with very simple controls, and the storyline in the game, while fairly short (Only 3-4 hours long), was very enjoyable and was worth the $20 I spent in my opinion.

While I do wish the game was longer, so I could experience even more of the beautiful landscape and continue playing, I was very happy with the game, and personally didn't feel like I was cheated out of my money in any way.

metacritic,Simoss13,firewatch,"Firewatch is a visual novel style game in which took a creative perspective as most of the game is voiced acted over a radio to a faceless female boss.
You start by making life choices, weather you have kids or you move house etc that will lead you taking serenity on a fire tower over the summer looking for early signs of a bush fire. This is done by first person perspective where you trail the forest for suspicious behaviour though the summer. I loved the idea of a personal story as you choose your options.
Although engaged me though the full 4 hour journey there were a few issues;
The art style they chose was fine and I like low poly textures, it just seems graphically blank walking to point A to point B
The game is very linear, being in a forest, I would of expected certain areas to be more open to explore and discover.
Henry (your character) seems to walk a little too show. You can run but keeps turning off.
Although you can choose dialogue options though having great remarks, this had little impact for the end game. If they have alternative endings from the choices in the story, the replay value would be great.
Overall the biggest issue is the gameplay itself I found to be dull at times as all you mostly do is walk to different parts of the forest. If you want a personal compelling story by all means give it a go but do not feel excited (or even entertained) by the gameplay",6,10
metacritic,visiblelight7,firewatch,"Very boring. The story isn't even there to drag you threw the gameplay loop which is mainly you walking toward your destintion while holding your map and compass and getting annoyed because the road is not ''obvious''. This gameplay loop begins IMMEDIATELY. The story consists of you talking on the walkey talkey with a very annoying feminist. I was bored out of my mind. There's no characters , no worthy story either. don't download this if you are bored. Good thing i had gamepass. The game is VERY overrated. It's at most a 4/10",3,10

metacritic,clem666,firewatch,"The game starts with choices to be made that shine by their uselessness. Once you are dropped in the forest, things begin to be interesting. 'Firewatch' is beautiful, has a terrific atmosphere that can change as fast as the wind.
The characters are very attractive and manage to engage in an intense relationship without even seeing each other. Delilah (pull me out of here!) easily takes a special place in our hearts.
The soundtrack is amazing. Special thanks to this free-roam mode at the end of the game, which allows you to play with the music you love the most (I have to go with the 'Prologue' one).
The map is large enough to offer many different scenes and environments without being huge or boring to navigate.
We can complain about the ending, but it feels like it was premeditated. because there are way more clues than we actually think there is. It is like the more you get into it, the more you invest yourself in the mind-blowing plot.",8,10

The animations ooze so much character and style that it's easy to forget you're playing a 2D pixel-art game.Special shoutout to the text animations—truly genius design.

The Story
The story was gripping, though sometimes a little hard to follow.Overall, it's engaging and the main reason I pushed through to the end.

The Gameplay 
My biggest gripe with this game is, honestly, the gameplay. Maybe I just had the wrong expectations, but when I think of a ""drugged-up killer with a katana"", I imagine PURE SPEED.
The actual movement, however, feels slow and sluggish. I haven’t seen this mentioned in other reviews, but to me, the game felt slow.

metacritic,Tspeed,katana-zero,"The roll and slow mo mechanics elevate this above a lot of similar platform hack and slash games. Towards the end it becomes a bit puzzle like, in that you need to work out a specific order of operations for each room by trial and error - you can just blast your way through. But it never got too tedious for me. Overall, a great game",9,10
metacritic,JAG7,katana-zero,"Great game! If you loved Hotline Miami , you’ll love this one. It’s fast, intense and violent. The challenge level is high, be prepared to die a lot. But the loading times are fast and the checkpoints are exactly where you died. Stages are small. Amazing music. This is another Indy  jewel.",9,10

metacritic,mistermuck,katana-zero,"Really cool game! I first tried it during a Game Pass trial on my PC, and knew I had to get it on Switch (where it of course plays beautifully)! Still waiting for the promised free DLC levels though. I love the pixel art, animations, gameplay, music, etc!",9,10
metacritic,TSNintendogamer,katana-zero,"This is one of my all time favorite games  too.  For one thing the  controls feel so good!  That and along with just killing a character just makes it so satisfying from a gameplay standpoint.  The story is very good too.  I mean  it does lead you with some unanswered  questions but that's how it's supposed  to be.  Speaking  of which, I wish the DLC  would come out soon. I also like the slow down  and  reply mechanic.  The replay mechanic comes from the developer's other game pause ahead and  the developers always have something up their  sleeve with gameplay mechanics as the tower of heaven(the first game I played  from them), also had a unique mechanic.  The slow down mechanic really helps a lot with making the game fun too.  Lastly when the game  was announced at a Nintendo direct, I slept on it and I regret it as the game was way more fun hands on than when I saw the game at the direct.  I just thought it was a random  killing game but I couldn't be more wrong.",10,10
metacritic,EdwardG,katana-zero,"Katana Zero is a quality instant death 2D action game with an engrossing narrative and great music.

Combat is a good challenge without getting too frustrating. It's quite simple but it feels good to pull off as you slow down time to deflect bullets with your sword and dispatch your enemies with a single attack. I really enjoyed the story - it's mysterious and tragic, but it ends too soon... Thankfully some free DLC is in the works which I hope maintains the excellent standard of writing.

The soundtrack is top notch. It compliments the mood and tone of the game brilliantly.

I had fun with Katana Zero and found its story its most compelling feature. It's only a short game and as of yet it hasn't got a totally satisfying conclusion but it's definitely worth your time.",8,10
metacritic,drlowdon,katana-zero,"Taking place in a dystopic metropolis known as New Mecca, Katana Zero puts the player in control of an assassin known as Subject Zero. Thanks to a drug known as Chronos, he is able to slow down time and predict the future but it soon transpires that secrets are being kept from him.

In terms of gameplay Katana Zero is a 2D side-scrolling platformer in which players use their abilities to slow down time, deflect bullets and dodge attacks in order to kill all the enemies and move onto the next screen. With it’s fast pace, over the top violence, twisted plot and one hit kills, Katana Zero very much put me in mind of the excellent Hotline Miami, and the fact that it compares well shows that this is a very good game indeed.",8,10

Waiting for its sequel now.",8,10
metacritic,rebster,katana-zero,"This is a short, fun, fast-paced game that will leave you feeling satisfied after each level. The soundtrack is fantastic and the style and vibe of the game are amazing. The story is interesting although can be a bit confusing, and you also have dialogue options which is great. I bought it on sale and feel like I got my money's worth even though the game takes less than 4 hours to complete.",8,10
metacritic,Fnerd,katana-zero,"From the trailer I expected a 2D version of hotline maiami with fast paced combat and challenging gameplay, however I expect the transition from topdown perspective to classic 2D could do more harm than good.
Luckly I wasn't disappointed at all, hell, I prefer this than hotline maiami style gameplay.
The game has a very nice arcadey feel to it, all levels are unique in their own way, the music is groovy and the story has mistery injected into his vein. The only complain I have is that the game just ends at one moment, without a true moment to make all the buildup worthy, thing I expect will be fixed in the upcoming dlc. For 15$ it could be a bit of a luckluster experience if you aren't in this fastpaced style gameplay, but if you are this is an absolute must play, especially for speedrunners.",9,10
metacritic,xiekaidream,katana-zero,通关mark。 短小精悍的佳作， 子弹时间太好玩了， 剧情也好棒，有点赛博朋克风， 期待更新！,9,10
metacritic,Rubbish,katana-zero,"Fast paced action with satisfying combat as well as fun dialoge and a unique and interesting story. Every time i thought the game play might be starting to get repititive they would introduce a new element or level type that kept it fun and challenging. Its not super long and/or big but the price is fair for the quality especially on sale.
The music and art are also both fantastic.",9,10
metacritic,ColeComplains,katana-zero,"The amount of work and thought put into this game is astounding. Was it worth it? Without a doubt.

The artwork is just about the most pleasing it can get, mixing pixel art with shaders, screen shake, and other various effects. When handled wrong, these effects could feel like a mess, but they are fine-tuned to perfection.

The gameplay is fast-paced and addictive. It lets you slash through runt enemies at such a fast pace it makes you feel like a pro. There is a mechanic that allows you to slow down time for tougher times, and for less experienced players.

The story blew me away. Many have said and will continue to say that the story ""slows down the gameplay."" This is absurd. I wouldn't have even written this review if not for the story. It is incredibly well thought out. Not to mention the story is minorly altered by how you play, making it even more engaging. The gameplay and story intertwine to create a total masterpiece ****.

In conclusion, Katana Zero is one of the best indie games you can get. Do not listen to those who say the story drags the rest, or that the gameplay is repetitive, or that it is a ripoff of Hotline Miami. I do not wish to be too harsh but those people do not know what they are talking about.",10,10
metacritic,DennisGR,katana-zero,Katana zero is an amazing action 2d game with an engaging story and great bosses. Your chooses affect the game and your connections in mostly meaningful ways. 2021 and I am still waiting for the free dlc to re-download the game. It's worth buying and you are going to find enjoyment from it. Also the main mechanic of the game is one of the collet video game mechanics I have come across,10,10

metacritic,thryce3,katana-zero,"Katana Zero does an awful lot with the old-school aesthetic visually, narratively and emotionally.  The action is fun and the connecting the story to the trial-by-death gameplay is quite inventive. It does get a bit annoying at the end when you'll have to redo certain rooms over and over, but the respawn is quick. Overall terrific and perfect for the Switch",8,10

metacritic,Gontrand00,katana-zero,"Critics are pretty much just a bunch of idiots to downgrade the game so much.

This game is brilliant. It is really an excellent platform/combat game. The story is fresh and complex, the pacing is perfect, the controls are neat and it's just sooo much fun to wander in your killing missions (I'm not a psycho I swear).

The music and the ambiance are deep, I love the mechanic of forseeing (therefore the ability to rewind if you get killed). And the dialogue mechanics are neat too.

All in all, not much bad thing to say. It's ''short'' but enough difficulty to make you play for a bit, and I can't wait for the possible sequel/DLC.",10,10
metacritic,pcschmidt00,katana-zero,"I’m glad I picked this game back up recently. The sprite work and animations in this game are stellar. Add on some catchy music, an interesting story ,and some good old one-hit KO gameplay and you have a tight and fun platformer (kinda)",8,10
metacritic,mtkf,katana-zero,Fantastic gameplay and dark story mixed with addictive gameplay make his a must buy for any Switch owner. I only wish it was longer.,9,10
metacritic,lastfox,katana-zero,"It's a solid game but with much less variety than the reviews claim. The gameplay was too repetitive for my taste, but it's not a long game so there's that. I think a lot of effort has been done on the presentation but too little on the mechanics and therefore the replayability.
The story is a complete ripoff of Hotline Miami, which wasn't great to begin with if we're being honest. But the quirkiness of the characters and the wink wink dialogue started to grate on me pretty fast. The Devolver games feel terribly pretentious in that way, that they try to outsmart the player and use 'shock value' but most of the time I feel disengaged from the story/protagonist by those antics. The game sure looks beautiful, but that’s all there is unfortunately.",4,10
metacritic,AndyInfin,katana-zero,"That small game very surprised me. They create what authors of Hotline Miami can't do - good game, where you can die fast, but you can only doubt yourself for it.

metacritic,Norleft,katana-zero,"Muy buen juego, entraras en el título por el llamativo gameplay, la música y la rapidez con la cual ves que se pueden pasar los niveles, pero no es lo mejor del título.

Obviamente este juego bebe mucho de Hotline Miami y de como cambio en cierto modo los juegos indie pixel art con su gameplay adictivo de muerte y repetición, este juego adapta esa idea a su gameplay y aporta su narrativa e historia que hará que te quedes hasta el final.

Sinceramente es un titulo que merece mucho la pena jugarlo. no es de duración larga y te deja con ganas de más.",7,10

metacritic,vocvoc,katana-zero,"Solid games. Everything is nice for its genre.

Only complaint is the ""slowing time"" mechanics doesn't utilised to its full potential, although its very nice and goes along well with the story, even in speedrun you can turn this mechanic off smh.

Fun game nevertheless, worth for the price",9,10
metacritic,MasterYuco,katana-zero,"It is a game that surprises for good!  History and narrative take you on a moral and dreamlike question.  the art and gameplay are incredible as it refreshes the mechanics of the side scrolling.

metacritic,FirstSame,katana-zero,Katana is one of my favourite games. I love everything about. The setting is real good cause it's kinda giving a retrowave and 90's anime vibe. The main mechanic that plays with time is real good and fun to play.,10,10

The mechanics feel incredibly smooth and seem so finely tuned to let us feel like we can do the craziest moves without hesitation. The art style is perfectly cyberpunk and the story really had me feeling for a couple of pixel people running around. My only problem is that it took me so long to finally get to playing this to learn it's one of the best on the Switch. Also, thank you for not making yet another 300 hour game.",10,10
metacritic,spoonish,katana-zero,"This is the ultimate platforming game. Every single aspect about this game is flawless. From the gameplay to the story, this game is truly a must play if you are a fan of platforming and trippy yet inspiring storylines.",10,10
metacritic,sssshali,katana-zero,"Fun combat, interesting story.. kinda sad it ended on a cliffhanger like it did. At first I was turned off by the game because of all the visual gimmicks but then I found out you can turn them off in the options menu. Made it a much better experience and wasn't a strain in the eye visually. I like how after you finish a level it replays it for you... as a player it makes you want to perform as clean as possible.",8,10

metacritic,Xam,katana-zero,"Bonne ambiance, bonnes idées, graphismes fins malgré le pixel-art, bref : sympa.
Mais beaucoup trop court ; 6 heures pour le finir sans se presser. Et en plus il y a un petit manque de précision dans la jouabilité qui dans ce genre de jeux ne pardonne pas (le héros a tendance à trop flotter).
Hotline Miami 1 est meilleur.",6,10
metacritic,Jagoldrick,katana-zero,"Katana Zero is an absolutely astonishing experience. It has a rich story that keeps the player on their toes for its duration, while also building up to and subtly foreshadowing the punch-in-the-gut ending. The gameplay speaks for itself in a way I have never encountered before. The combat is challenging but fair (most of the time), and when you get the hang of it you almost feel as if you're dancing through the level, killing and dashing your way through what feels like completely unique encounters. The only issue I have with the game is how the difficulty curve is designed. The game is in no way easy, it beats you down and drags you through the dirt, but there are some encounters that do feel overly difficult just for the sake of being hard, a case in point being the optional therapist boss fight, which is like nothing else in the game in terms of difficulty.
Katana Zero was a huge surprise for me. I picked it up through a recommendation on the eshop, thinking it would be a quick Hotline Miami rip off, and ended up spending months devouring all the content that was available to me at the time, getting all the end game katanas and fighting the secret boss. If you're looking for a fast, compact action game that has a good story and simple mechanics, this is without doubt your game, and it's only £15, with no in-game purchases to speak of, so you won't have to file for bankruptcy over the game just because you wanted a new katana.",8,10
metacritic,Dwideshrude1,katana-zero,"I guess ZERO refers to the rating they wanted you to give the game by not explaining how the game saves. They have a complete disregard for your effort, time, and quality of life in this game. What a waste of my time.",0,10

metacritic,Sijun,katana-zero,One of the finest pixel art action games out there for sure! It is absolutely stunning in every aspect. The only downside is the short playtime but the timed run modus adds more than up for this. Worth a buy!,10,10
metacritic,Kacek1996,katana-zero,"I saw it for the first time at the Nintendo Direct, I think. This game made me wanting to buy it from the first sight. ""Katana ZERO!"" is an indie game with pixel graphics and great soundtracks. Gameplay can seem quite challenging, since getting hit means death. However, it is a game that you won't like to stop mid game (sadly, I had to take such a break for two days while being in the middle of the plot). Great game with breathtaking animations and boss fights, I would max it out again!",10,10
metacritic,Bastrix,katana-zero,"Brilliant little game, not too short but not very long either. You will die quickly but its fast paced and addictive. The simple combat mechanics are enough to keep you hooked throughout the entire game. The art and animations are awesome, the story goes a little bit too mental for my taste but its part of its charm. Well worth the money!",8,10
metacritic,Lewonski,katana-zero,Jogabilidade fluida e muito envolvente para quem gosta de um jogo frenético. Ótimo port para o switch,8,10
metacritic,nusco,katana-zero,"Katana Zero does everything right. It has a brilliant story that blends a liberal dose of Tarantino with a touch of Cronenberg; it has crisp 16-bits graphics that's a plesure to look at; and above all, it has great action, which is the reason why you want to play it.

The formula of Katana Zero is deceptively simple. Each mission screen is extremely short–possibly a few seconds, or a minute long. However, some of the elements in the action are impossibly fast–until you use the limited ""bullet time"" mechanics in the game. Once you get used to it, you can happily run through the ultra-violent scenarios performing ninja stunts such as returning bullets to the sender with a slash of your katana, or throwing an object at a flying sentry while slashing through two enemies at the same time. The over-the-top, extreme action makes you feel like a badass, and the pulpy, unpredictable story gives a clever justification to the time-bending mechanics.

Katana Zero  is short, but it's all the better for it. As soon as I'd finished, I played it all over a second time. It's that good. This is one of the best indies of the year, and it deserves to be played.",9,10
metacritic,dylande,katana-zero,"Katana Zero may not have an open world, maybe not even a world that the story fully fleshes out or takes time to explain, but I can't think **** that is as fast and cool as this one. Deceptively deep combat, with new features to add in every level, not to mention multiple endings and new modes to unlock, Katana Zero gives some of the Dark Souls-ish gratification of beating a level, and makes you feel like a badass, all at once. Indie Game of the Year contender for me, perhaps even the winner.",9,10
metacritic,TheHambro,katana-zero,"Katana Zero is, simply put, a phenomenal video game that has everything in a bite sized package: beautiful and fluid pixel art, a bangin' soundtrack, fast paced and breakneck gameplay, a wild story and intriguing characters.  Seriously, what Katana Zero manages to do in its relatively short length is not only very impressive, but does it better than other bigger titles.  If I had to give the game criticism, then I suppose the length is a little short and there isn't much in replay value; however, you may miss a few things during your first playthrough.

Katana Zero is a brilliant game that I simply can't recommend enough, and I urge everyone to definitely pick this one up.",9,10
metacritic,Clone_Jock,katana-zero,"Katana Zero is a brilliant game. The game never feels like it’s running out of ideas and keeps you entertained with its stunning visuals, immersive story, and BREATHTAKING soundtrack.",10,10
metacritic,vAbyssWalker,katana-zero,"Gameplay:
The animation of slashing enemies around in Katana Zero is pretty satisfying, and the game has a good variety of enemies, every enemy has a different way of defeating, but the main mechanics are very simple, it doesn’t have any depth at all, thus putting a lot of weight on the level design.
Design : The best aspect of Katana Zero design is the different ways to complete every level, you have the freedom to take the path you want and finish the level the way you like.
Every level offers a great variety of new mechanics and goes in-depth in them and intertwine them in a genius way.
the design carries the gameplay for most of the game.
Story:
An intriguing mystery in an interesting setting, genius storytelling with a good multi-choice dialogue and whole lot of interesting characters, the only flaw in the story is the ending, it doesn’t “end” anything.
Extras :
The art direction/scores are actually one of the best in the industry, it immerses you in the neo-noir setting to the limit. Bottom line... Katana Zero is a must-play masterpiece.",9,10
metacritic,Switchindiefix,katana-zero,"Halfway through, I wanted to give Katana Zero a score of 10/10. The gameplay is fluid and responsive, the presentation is great, the characters are well-developed, and the overall atmosphere is extremely well-done. It’s easy to get lost in the game world and immersed into your role as the Dragon, especially as things get darker and your dialogue choices become more tortured and emotional. Unfortunately, the confusing nature of the story (and the cliffhanger-ish ending, about which I won’t say another word) drags things down just a bit. I’m still getting all the DLC that comes out for this game, as I need to know how this story ends.

Bottom line: this is one of the best games on the Switch and an absolute Indie Game of the Year candidate. Don’t hesitate to pull the trigger (or draw the sword) and download Katana Zero.",9,10

metacritic,Turyman,katana-zero,"How to describe Katana Zero? It is not a masterpiece by all means, that's for sure. However it is a solid game. Though I mainly liked it for the art style and music the gameplay gimmick of ""slowing time"" mixed with a story that's mostly average you end up K.Zero. Fast action moments and dialogue options having partial effects on the story makes it interesting enough to finish. Although not a gem, it's worth checking out if you want a samurai retro game adventure.",7,10
metacritic,jeffbizloc,katana-zero,"Katana Zero brings quality over quantity as a time slowing platformer/tactical game.  It also mixes in a psychedelic story.

Game(s) like: Mark of the Ninja

Pros:
- Gameplay was super fun being able to slow down time.  Any time manipulation and I am pretty much liking the game.
- Though I couldn't always follow the story I like the Metal Gearish type story

Cons:
- Save points were bad.  My son switched to another game and I had to pretty much play over a level.  This happened a couple times.
- Couldn't skip dialog even if I'd seen it
- I usually prefer quality over quantity but the gameplay was so good this game should of been longer",8,10

metacritic,themizarkshow,super-meat-boy,Difficulty done right. You are given such fine control over meatboy that it's always clear what you couldhave done better or differently. And the super fast restart means there is no time to mourn your last run... You just need to go again.,9,10
metacritic,PlatonicAnger,super-meat-boy,"I found the game to be incredibly tedious and irritating. The constant repetition of trying to save Bandage Girl, only to have her taken away each time, quickly became frustrating. The difficulty level also seemed unnecessarily high, leading to many moments of frustration and anger. Despite these negative aspects, I will say that the game does have a certain addictive quality to it. The fast-paced gameplay and colorful graphics kept me coming back for more, even when I felt like throwing my controller across the room. Overall, my review of ""Super Meat Boy"" is mixed. While it does have its entertaining moments, the overall experience left me feeling more annoyed than satisfied. I would recommend this game to those who enjoy a challenge, but be prepared for some *frustrating moments along the way.",7,10
metacritic,T9990009,super-meat-boy,"Super meat boy is a great game with lots of variety and interesting levels. Although I do find a few levels frustrating and too hard, most of them are still fun to play. I love how this game goes for a bit of a retro aspect with its warp zones and amazing retro music. Another selling point for me is the inclusion of characters from other games and their unique abilities.Each one of their abilities makes some levels a walk in the park while some characters make levels near impossible.There is also a huge variety of obstacles, spikes, lasers, breakable blocks and conveyor belts are all challenges you must overcome and obstacles you must master. I think this game manages to balance difficulty with fun pretty well, and if you’re skilled enough can prove to be a good time.
Overall super meat boy is a good game that is for sure worth the money.",9,10

Its story is beautiful, the gameplay is hard the way the game wants to be, and this makes it one of the best 2d parkour platformer that is available.

metacritic,lostleader,super-meat-boy,"I understand entirely why people like this game, but it just doesn't resonate with me in comparison. The challenges are hard, but not to an absurd degree, and it feels like such an accomplishment to beat any given level and see how many deaths it took you. The controls are very tight, even while using keyboard controls, and while deaths are plenty, it never feels like a penalty with how fast you respawn. Even the death's have a sort of meaning, in the fact it helps warn you about certain threats or helps with spacing. All in all Super Meat Boy is a wonderful challenge and fantastic platform, but just not one that appeals to me. The cutscenes are often super fun and cute tho!",8,10

metacritic,OrdinaryCarrot,super-meat-boy,"Super Meat Boy is a hardcore platformer, in which your objective is to save your girlfriend ""Bandage Girl"", from the evil ""Dr. Fetus"" (whom is... a fetus, inside a mech-like suit).

The game starts off easy at first, but wow, does it get difficult in the later levels. I'd say this game is comparable to the likes of N++, albeit way more fast paced and precision based. Almost on an annoying scale (at least to me). Some levels just feel unfair with the difficulty spikes, while some are at just the right difficulty for how far you progressed. It feels unbalanced overall to me (but that's my opinion).

Overall its a great game, and I'd recommend it to anyone who likes platformers!",8,10

metacritic,SuperkenGaming,super-meat-boy,"Super Meat Boy
Super Frustrating
Super Meatboy is an insta death platformer wit hpuzzle elements where you play as meat boy trying to get through this games 7 different chapters and save bandage girl from the evil dr fetus
This game can be beaten in about 6 hours despite each level beign designed to be beaten in less than 20 seconds..
The hook of this game is its frustratingly addictive difficulty
The mechanics of Super Meat Boy is simple, which makes it so easy to pick up and in turn so easy to forgive as youre dying over and over..
You jump, run jump, or wall jump…
Nothing else…
Its up to you to use these mechanics to maneuver through the games many obstacle courses of blades, lava, and salt.. and you only have one life to do this…
The difficulty of levels is really up and down..
And this is thanks to the game constantly adding new obstacles and enemies to deal with as the game goes on…
When a new mechanic is introduced it will slow down a bit..
This in turn creates a great pacing.. the levels aren’t constantly smacking you over the head with difficulty..
Youll at times get a nice breather…
But when levels are hard theyre hard…
and despite them making you want to pull your hair out, its just as hard to put down the controller and walk away.. at least for a little while…
For me the Charm of super meat boy started to wear off by chapter 3..
I was over the hook of dying and retrying, but that’s mostly because of the kind of gamer I am…
Im not into punishment for more than a little while..
But if you are one of those sick freaks that likes getting to the point of wanting to break your controller, Super Meat Boy is a great platformer full of collectables to unlock new characters, hidden levels, charm, great characters, and surprisingly engaging boss battles that only feel cheap the first 100 times you die…
I give Super Meat Boy
an 8/10",8,10
metacritic,shwisha,super-meat-boy,Until playing Super Meat Boy I thought Super Mario World had the best 2d platformer physics. Super Meat Boy has now taken that crown. The game is all about its movement mechanics and continually impresses you in how it finds new ways to use them.,9,10

metacritic,xXCreepyB4byXx,super-meat-boy,"This game wasn't too bad in the early levels.  The controls aren't super tight, but it didn't really matter much as most of the game is just sprinting forward and jumping at the right time.  However, later in the game, very specifically, the warp Zone to unlock the kid, you have to use pixel perfect and frame perfect jumps multiple times through the same level.  It's stupid, and for me, it's a deal breaker.  I looked up the stats on this game and saw that over 95% of buyers never beat the light world.  I began to realize that this is another one of those extremely **** games that just wants to be hard and not good.

**** SMB.  Is it Hard?  Yeah, it's hard.  Is it good?  **** no, it's not good because it lacks consistency.  The jumping, fans and repulsers are all incredibly inconsistent in this game.  Next time, Try making a game that's GOOD and also hard, not one that you don't expect anyone to beat.  Phil Fish is lucky as **** that you can't return a digital download.

metacritic,ScarletSentry,super-meat-boy,"I give this game a 10 but take this review with a grain of salt. I have ALOT of time in this game, I think its the best single player experience I've had in gaming but I can't recommend it for everybody.

The game is for a specific kind of gamer. Let me just say before you start, you WILL die and you will die over and over again. So why is it so good? The controls are ridiculously tight, aside from lag issues you will never die without knowing it was you who screwed up :D There are no unfair jump scare style obstacles, no control issues, no R.N.G. based jumps or unfair enemies, everything is about you and your ability to play.

The game comprises over 300 levels mostly short, about 10-30 second for the average player though most can be done in under 10 depending on character choice and skill.

There are 15 playable characters and most have their own appeal though some are just kinda gimmicky or useless.

The introduction to the game is gradual, most gamers will put away forest (chapter 1) and wonder what the hype is about for this game but you will find a challenge in the game and even more should you choose to speedrun, which aside from the tiny RNG element brought in by Larry and GG, (you'll know what I mean if you speedrun,) is a great game for speedruning.

I have praised the level design already but there are a few levels in the 300+ which I wont reveal the names of but that are just annoying, nothing more too it. Many allow for inventive routing and some still have character debates (who's fastest, who's safest etc.) 5 years after release which should show how well constructed the game is. The speedrun's are still evolving be it IL, or 106.

So in summary, if you want a hard platformer, are patient and dont mind repition, this is completely worth a **** you hate repetition, forget it. and if you want a speedrun game go for it.",10,10
metacritic,AriesRevolver,super-meat-boy,"This is my favorite game in all of Xbox 360 arcade library. The gameplay is hard as nails, but the controls never make it unfair.

First, the game is terribly ugly with the blood of meat boy makes graphics very bad taste, In addition, if you like to do 100 000 times the same level this game is for you, because to succeed in this game you must know almost all levels by heart. The handling is also horrible and give you cramps in hands. Another overrated indie game. I give two points for the music which is very good and 8-bit style levels.",2,10
metacritic,augh18,super-meat-boy,"Literally took me just over a year to beat.  Not because it has that much content, but because it's so challenging that I kept having to take extended breaks from it in fear of returning to the glory days of gaming where I snapped controllers in half or threw them at my TV because the game did not give a **** about my skill level, I either achieved what it was demanding of me or I did not see the next level.  When I finally got 200/200 achievement points, I took a screenshot and put it in a super-important section of my email, as a permanent trophy of the frustration I endured in order to get a useless trophy.  It's a video-game pride thing.

I do kind of wish we had more of these games, because it reminds me a lot of the early days of gaming, but I also realize why we don't have a lot of them.  It's just too punishing to be a sustainable business model, but damn, did I ever love this game while it was making fun of me for being unable to eat bricks.

I quit the game for a few months until one of my best friends sent me a copy of the game on pc (always a sweetheart). I played the game on the pc and I found the same enjoyment as before and much much more. The more I played the game the more I loved it. The gameplay is very nice and all the characters move very fluently. Most of all in the game I believe I love the sense of accomplishment whenever I finish a very tough level for the first time. The game is very difficult but with enough practice anyone can beat any of the levels in it. The game brings a wonderful enjoyment to the player when it comes to completing a level and the soundtrack adds more enjoyment in my book.

The reason why I give it an extra point is that all of the levels were unique, by design and placement I mean. Buzz saws are everywhere in this game, and it was disappointing to see that feature in most of the levels. You can also get extra characters, which consist of one extra move each. The extra move isn't very effective, seeing that you can finish a level by running and jumping. The boss battles are equally cheap. My brothers get so much fun out of it. I decided to game in a separate room, where I discovered that, if you go to your friends list while they are playing Super Meat Boy, there was the title of the game and below it: How many times they died on the level they were playing. This made me wonder if the true fun of this game was to die. I'd like to play a game that was solely meant to be FINISHED, not played a thousand times on the same stage.",2,10

Yes, there are times where you're tearing your hair out because it's so difficult.. BUT THAT'S THE FUN OF IT! If you're not good at platformers or prefer hand holding, this game is NOT for you.

metacritic,DoktorSlenderma,super-meat-boy,"I decided to give the game 1 in score since it had ""okay"" controls and a few funny moments. Those two factors however, are microscopic compared to the awful level design, cheap difficulty and short playtime. It seams like we have come to a time were being unfairly difficult, suddenly means good. If the game has so terrible physics and controls that it becomes a puzzle just using a fan to jump to a platform, the game is apparently good. You do have unlimited lives however, sso that you can play the same thing 50+ times until you finally get it. FUN. Also, the controls are slightly off. Meatboy doesn't jump when you jump, which can get pretty annoying when your walljumping from small platforms and need to be quick. The story is pretty much Mario, but with a fetus. Charming. Also, the final boss to this game, has to be the absolute stupidest, most unfair thing I've ever fought in a videogame. This game is just pure trial and error, but emphasised on the error part.

metacritic,MediaFreak,super-meat-boy,"If you seek a feeling of accomplishment in your life, finishing this game will certainly do that for you.  Super Meat Boy is an excellent platformer that really punishes you for making a mistake but rewards perfection.  Most levels in Super Meat Boy are less than 30 seconds long, but some of them will take you hours and will have you crying out in anger.  Once you've done a level you get to sit back and watch the replay of all your miserable attempts at once.  The main game it's self is fairly big as it is, and the last boss is a real killer, but once you manage to finish it you'll still have the dark world levels (which is just as big, but a little harder), plenty of bandages to get and also a few warp zones which send you into early adaptations of Super Meat Boy like 8 bit, which are great little throw backs for any retro game lovers.

The music in this game is also stupendous. It sets the hardcore mood really nicely and the stunning visuals help as well. The only drawback in this game is that it gets a little repetitive and that it is mostly due to it's insane difficulty.

metacritic,Tashy497,super-meat-boy,"I'll keep it short and sweet. This game is a solid 10. I originally played the demo and thought no thanks on the purchase. I waited about a year and was feening for some old school 2D games... SMB I tried. This game has the best controls... some reviews say otherwise. I find that funny... because if you happen to beat this game and get good enough to pass some of the challenging levels you'll notice first and foremost how incredibly detailed the play mechanics are... as the moves needed are precise.

I don't claim to be an elite gamer... I did beat the game... and when I got to play as BandAid Girl I never completed her world because it was too hard. I also was unable to beat the dark world for the final level. The only character that I gave up on trying to get was The Kid... I think ""The Kid"" levels, only playing the first level are beyond impossible.... and if you've gotten past this, you are a savant.

I thought I was getting old because I lost interest in games... after discovery Team Meat and McMillen I have the same feeling I got when I played old school consoles.

The unlockables are fanastic, and the old school throwbacks (i.e. Gameboy levels) are top notch. This game opened me up to a bunch of Indie Games I never heard of and I thank you SMB for doing so.",10,10

This game ramps up difficulty at an alarming pace and doesn't stop there, as it gives you a additional chapter, and a chapter full of user-created hard levels that are constantly updated, and the upcoming Super Meat World chapter, they just don't stop giving us levels. Despite the abnormally high amount of tough-as-bones levels (over 300!!!), it still gives us that pushing feeling that we have enough lives (unlimited) to perfect that impossible jump, run, wall jump, or missile dodge that keeps resetting us back to the start with no pause or loading. This game is for those who are looking for a challenge in their game, and not for gamers who like to enjoy a game peacefully, because you will attempt to break the remote at trying to make that !@#$ jump!

metacritic,ICUH8N,super-meat-boy,"A wholly charming, clever, and humorous labor of love that has more than its fair share of nods to retro gaming such as the Game Boy and Atari inspired warp zone levels and parodies of classic gaming intros like Castlevania (even the title's abbreviations, SMB, match those of Super Mario Bros.'). The level design, music, art aesthetics and amount of levels (300+) are true crowd pleasers as is the near perfect controls and number of bonus items, such as hidden bandages, characters, warp zones and Dark World stages that you unlock from besting the ""par time"" on each level. Simply put, this game has enough to keep you busy for awhile. Furthermore, for a game that's so silly in style the last few levels feel completely epic and upon completion leave you with a sense of accomplishment that few games on the market provide. Speaking of accomplishment, yes this game is incredibly difficult, but the stages are short enough and creatively designed that you'll nail even the more daunting encounters given some patience and practice, something that couldn't be said about the similarly styled N+ (side bar: I died around 4,000 times by the time I finished the dark world and still love this title). The only things that keep this from being a 10/10 are a few, minor nitpicky things. Notably, it would be nice to have a button that cancels your wall slide and another that stops your horizontal movement through the air as fidgeting the control pad left-to-right in order to land perfectly can be infuriatingly awkward. Additionally, while the level design is mostly spot-on a handful of levels are simply way too difficult and demand absolute perfection with literally zero margin for error, such as The Kid warp zone. Though, like I said those are only VERY minor complaints and overall this is easily one of the best titles on the Xbox 360, not just XBLA. If you love platforming games, retro-style entertainment and welcome a change-of-pace punishing difficulty then this is a definitive must-buy title.",9,10
metacritic,DME,super-meat-boy,"[MILD SPOILERS] Okay... so you play as a raw, bleeding cube of meat that is trying to rescue a female cube of bandages that was kidnapped by a fetus in a jar wearing a tuxedo... You can see how serious this game is. The levels are short, which is good because you will be consistantly spilling your juices all over the place and having to start over. The game manages to be retro 80s challenging whithout being rediculously impossible. And besides the standard challenges, there are cool bosses, hidden minigames (warp zones) unlockable characters (I love you Gish!) and an entire ""dark world"" which is the same game you just played only modified to be even more challenging. The game is also filled with hilarious cutscenes (don't you DARE skip them!) and contains other elements of humor.  Also, let me say that this game is nothing like ""I Wanna Be The Guy"".  In games like IWBTG, memorization is the key to winning.  But in Super Meat Boy, the key to winning is straightforward skill.  If you can't win, it's YOUR fault. (like the game N+)  Simple as that.  So... uhh.... I love meat.",10,10

In ""I wanna be the guy"" you have to know what happens next, but in Super Meat Boy you have to play, fail and replay. Enough of that !
The game did not really surprise me, because I knew from the first time I've seen the trailer, that this game is going to be awesome and it did not disappoint me. This game has a perfect control. You think, that you have the complete control of Meat Boy and the way he moves is so perfect. As you all may know the stages are mostly very, very hard and in the Darkworld they are even harder. You can unlock new characters to play, too. It will take a long time to totally beat this game, but it is worth it ! Oh, and it's very funny, too.",10,10

metacritic,Ravmon64,super-meat-boy,"Truly a refreshing sight for sore eyes. In a world where multiplayer shooters have for some reason taken over, platformers have lost the attributes that true gamers love and that made them great to begin with. Increasingly difficult gameplay, unique setting and challenges, and replay value seem to be appearing less and less on consoles aside from the Wii(Donkey Kong Country Returns, New Super Mario Bros, Super Mario Galaxy 2), but Super Meat Boy brings these things onto the Xbox 360. With a plethora of challenging levels, video replay features that display all your attempts at once, a quirky and very fun story line with great characters, and so much to do will have you hooked to this game. Now, this is not for the faint of heart and those who easily quit, or are willing to blame the controls or difficulty of the game. Super Meat Boy is for the gamer with more than a touch of skill, patience, and a bit of masochism to get through the thousands of deaths one encounters on the journey to save Bandage girl. With a group of characters from various indie games, all with unique abilities, Super Meat Boy offers over 300 levels that will take a high degree of patience and timing to get the sought after 100% completion achievement.",10,10
metacritic,JON_RYO,super-meat-boy,"Been playing this game for a while now, while it pays homage to its predecessors of the platform genre it ramps up the difficulty and incases it in digestable levels that dont tend to be overly long, with the sense of accomplishment after you beat a level you were struggling on being all the satisfaction you need. After the first 2- 3 worlds helping to ease you in to the games brutal learning curve things begin to get a little tougher in the aptly named 'HELL' and it just keeps getting harder from there, but youll just keep coming back for one more go with a 'I can do it THIS time' mentality not unlike a boxer that just got knocked out in his last 4 fights, and beaten to within an inch of his life but for a reason no one can fathom He MUST get back in the ring. One of the best and most difficult platformers I've had the pleasure of playing a great indie game with more than 300 levels to keep you going for a long time. Recommended.",9,10

metacritic,incendiary69,super-meat-boy,"This looks to be like an addictive game. Unfortunately this game was released with a severe bug that prevents autosaving your progress, will give you an incorrect completion %, and will not track your progress correctly. Trust me, this is NOT the kind of game where you want to replay levels because of a stupid bug. What infuriates me is not only has the bug not been fixed over a MONTH after the game's release, but because I know there is no chance this bug wasn't caught in playtesting.

Seriously, how do you bring about this bug? You simply press Y to replay a level after completing it. There are many reasons why you might want to this -- in order to get the bandage which you didn't get, or to beat your time. Knowing what playtesting is like even for the Indie games on the xbox, I can tell you that there is NO CHANCE this bug wasn't caught in playtesting. I have even gotten the bug when I carefully exited to the map after every level.

Since there is no chance this wasn't caught (trust me), Microsoft intentionally let a crippled game out the door. I am sure they did this for money reasons, even giving the game a temporary $10 ""sale"". While I do believe this was MSFT's decision, the game creators are complicit in this and should be ashamed.",2,10

metacritic,Super-Evil-DOOM,super-meat-boy,"Wow, this game is freaking awesome. It's so charming and hilarious. If you don't laugh watching one of these cutscenes, you have no soul. Super Meat Boy is unpredictable, it's challenging, but best of all, it's deep. Over 300 levels, stuff to collect, characters to unlock, and going all the way through everything will test your skill and patience. This is one of the best games to release all year, and is right up there with Limbo. It's so difficult at times that it makes Limbo look easy. There is constantly something to strive for while playing this game and that's part of what makes it so fun. There are bandages to collect which contribute to achievements and hidden character unlocks, warp zones in some levels for more retro-inspired challenge, par times to beat for every level (except boss fights) which unlocks a harder, Dark World version of the level with more bandage, warp zones, etc. to go after. Sometimes the level even ""glitches"" at random and if you complete it while that happens you go to a different, much more difficult world which is reminiscent to ""Minus World"" in Super Mario Bros.

Constant nods to past classic games and great indie developer humor coupled with tons of fun characters to unlock makes this game a hell of a lot of fun. The characters have different abilities too. Commander Video from Bit.Trip.Video can glide through the air while Tim from Braid can rewind time for three seconds. There are so many levels to play and so many ways to play through them with a large variety of characters to unlock, Super Meat Boy is packed with charm and challenge.",9,10

The levels a fiendish and the controls are responsive, the visual style and sound is great with the theme and i can't find anything wrong with it.",10,10
metacritic,JimmyoftheDead,super-meat-boy,"While i can understand where peoples frustration for this game is coming from, this game really makes you look at it and want to beat it. The main drawback to this game are not its controls, but how the controls are used. The controls are more or less fantastic, simply moving, jumping, and accelerating. But the catch is that the levels are of the trial and error sorts. I don't think there is anyone that could play this game and beat it without dying at least 50 times. The game throws enemy's, saws and forms of killer ground to make you earn the ending. Thankfully, the game is forgiving, giving you no lives of which you have to keep a watch on. The graphics are you average 2-D plat-former that looks incredible to some, but a few will find they wanted more out of it. What is really incredible about this game is the throwback to older 2-D plat-formers, such as Mario and Ninja Gaiden. Each new world opens with a cut scene that is a parody of a well loved game, but doesn't edger on the ridiculous. The main reason this game has gotten so many bad scores from the users is because of the levels that make this game so challenging. I literally died over 100 times in one simple level, but the placement of the enemies and the saws are what killed me. But the part that i loved is that in the end i wanted to beat the level because i wanted to see the ending. Some people found this game too hard and would rather have a game that didn't have them yelling at their Tv set, but some love a good challenge, and this game delivers that 10 fold.",7,10

The mechanics are easeir than I expected after reading some reviews...I guess they are the type of controls that some take to and some do not, but I am not seeing the issue with clunky controls that some have mentioned.

metacritic,Johangsl,super-meat-boy,"SMB is a jewel of the current gaming generation. I have not played a game like this before, first thing I want to comment on are the controls, It sure seems Team MeatBoy spent quite some time tweaking the controls, its a perfect connection between the mind and control. The graphics for me are charming as it best, from Atari to NES and the normal level design, It has really gotten me nostalgic. Yes, ITS HARD, but I like it that way, nailing a perfect run on a stage that minutes before seemed like the end of my SMB gaming days always boosts me up to go foward! An inside out boy, a girlfriend made of bandages and an evil fetus in a jar + lots of character's from other indie games, downloadable levels to never ever be able to fully drop the game. For me, probably one of the best games I have played this year, overall, not just XBOX Live...OVERALL I SAID. Forgot **** music...makes me want to run around my room...chiptune madness. I would have given this a 9.8 it it was possible, for a missing feature...a music box or something to listen to the songs I desire (like the boss fights, awesome).

Whether its beating every single level, beating them AGAIN in the dark world (same map layout, twice the traps) or unlocking all the characters, you will find it hard to put down.

metacritic,Anatana,super-meat-boy,"Registered just to review this game, that is how strongly I feel about it. Though it launched with a few bugs (likely the result of Team Meat being so small) that affect the leader boards and occasionally the auto save, the rest of the game is polished as hell. The level design is varied and consistently inventive and continually challenges you and keeps you on your toes. The ""Aha!"" factor is HUGE here, and it makes playing the game constantly rewarding. At the same time, Team Meat must clearly be sadists. I rarely got truly angry at the difficulty though. There were plenty of times where I would die in a ridiculous manner that had clearly been predicted and I would just end up laughing at the insanity of it all. The music has been praised in nearly every review I've seen, and it deserves every bit of the accolades it receives.  The decision not to restart a track every time you die was absolutely key as well (as you will die. a lot. no, really. Especially in warp zone 5-7). The controls are tight and responsive, but also take some getting used to, and I have seen reviews that unfairly criticize this aspect of them. They also vary drastically by the character you choose to play with (and the unlockable aspect of the game is a joy as well, especially considering that Tim from Braid shows up!)

Along with the stellar Braid and Limbo, this is an absolute must have off of the Xbox Live Arcade, and is exactly the kind of quality experience I am looking for in a game that I buy from that venue. While I would recommend Braid and Limbo pretty much without reservation, this game certainly isn't going to be fun for anyone who doesn't enjoy a challenge. But for those who are looking to test their chops and have a hell **** time doing it, pick this up today - especially considering that it is only $10 until the end of October! At that price this is an absolute steal. It is beyond addictive in a way that few games have been recently, in my experience at least. It's 3 am as I write this, and all I want to do is load it up and play another couple levels.",10,10
metacritic,RedXIII,super-meat-boy,"Super Meat Boy is delightfully frustrating, surprisingly deep, charming, and very addictive. 1 point off for some serious frustration, but this game will dig it's meaty claws into you which will have you itching to complete just 1 more level with an A+ ranking and collect that last band aid.",9,10
metacritic,Compozer,super-meat-boy,"I know it's coming straight from the Gamespot review, but they're right. This game is about reward. The warm, fuzzy feeling you get when you barely snag a bandage, bypass a impossible obstacle, and save the girl cannot be beat. Controls are tight and fluid while bypassing saw blades and jumping over pits of lava, and if you get torn to shreds, it's because YOU messed up. Not because of unfair level design, because you timed a jump wrong or miscalculated distance. Overall, it's one of the best $10 you can spend, and with a huge amount of content and fun, there's really no reason not to.",9,10

metacritic,AdamStarks,super-meat-boy,"I don't understand the love for this game. The controls, while tight, are also totally awkward. For example, if you release the thumbstick while in mid-air, your horizontal speed is retained. This means if I'm jumping right and want to fall straight down, I have to hold left, and then fiddle between left and right a bunch to narrow it down. Little things like this are constantly getting in the way, and I'm finding that much of the game's difficulty comes from fighting the controls.",5,10
metacritic,GothofCookie,super-meat-boy,"At first: It's a 2D jump-n'-run and you have to rescue/reach the princess at the end of each short level  (I don't have to say she gets kidnapped over and over again, do I?)  You have to avoid obstacles (it introduces new ones regularly), glide down walls and use the terrain for your advantage like in hundreds of other games. Simple graphics, no real innovations, unforgiving as hell and without any big storyline. Nevertheless nearly everybody loves this game. You wonder why? Well I'll tell you - the graphics are simple but stylish and fitting. It puts every scene in a special mood and when meatboy glides down the wall leaving a blood trail behind - nobody would say it looks awful. But yes you will die. You will die a lot. Maybe more often then in any other game. But you'll hardly get frustrated 'cause it's never the games' fault. Thanks to the great controls you know it were just you making a little mistake. And you'll revive instantly at the starting-point anyway (yep, no checkpoints at all). Furthermore each try will be saved and shown in the replay,too. Every one at once - nothing is more satisfying than seeing dozens of meatboys die and one jumping through in a amazing speed without hitting anything. It's like ""dude you totally made it! Hell yeah!"".  You'll often be surprised how  short the levels are (around 30 seconds) but with a content of over 300 maps, bonus stages and warp zones (hidden portals with some challenging extra-maps) dark worlds and the unlock-able characters (by collecting bandages placed on masochistic locations on several levels and finishing warp zones) you have tons to do and it's hard to get bored. On top of that you're able to implement Maps made by the community with the editor. In easy words: Download usermade maps from the Internet. It's one of the best plattformers of the last years but also it's an hate-or-love thing. Whether you get instantly addicted for hours and hours or you bite frustrated in your controller and try to burn your HDD out of your xbox. I strongly recommend buying - yep, there's a chance you'll regret it but the risk of missing an awesome piece of game is much higher.",10,10

metacritic,krix,super-meat-boy,"Super Meat Boy is a perfectly designed arcade platformer which is so well-thought-out that there is little space for frustration. The controls are easy to learn and all the levels are precisely designed. It's true that most of the levels require several retries and that you could have a hard time if you never played one of those old-school arcade games like mario 3 or megaman 2, but that's how the game works and repeating a level over and over again has never been so little frustrating. It's a fact that you keep getting better and better with each retry constantly increasing your game-skills and minimizing the amount of luck you need to beat a level. Furthermore the game is packed with ideas and nice features that make you want to play it over and over again, collecting more bandages (which you need to unlock new characters) or beating your best time.

While there is some charm to be found in the simple mechanics and presentation, the controls can be very loose and fickle.  The levels, while short, have almost no margin for error, therein leading to frustration and poor level design masquerading as ""challenge"".  The only reason this is forgivable by so many reviewers is that the very short levels allow for endless instant restarts until, often by luck, you get it just right.

This game brought me back to simpler days of relying on SKILL to enjoy a game. That is something I haven't felt in another game for a LONG time. There have been many great games, indie games even... but there's a certain feeling that only a masterfully crafted game can give you from just GAMEPLAY alone... forget intricate story lines and super ultra realistic graphics.

metacritic,Tragus,super-meat-boy,"Impossibly good.  This game should not be compared directly to the retro games of yore.  Their clunky controls are reason enough to take a hard look at what was, and know that it belongs in the past.  This is the future of platform gaming.  The story, while simple, is hilarious, and the cut scenes are actually worth watching for a change. The art is simply enough to make it easy to follow the game, but carries loads of personality. The music is amazing, and despite reports to the contrary, are not all chip-tune tracks.  Orchestral, synth and the occasional chippy track in the warp zone levels round out the game nicely.  The sound effects are perfectly disgusting, the sound of sloshing, swishing meat drove my wife from the room, so PROPS for that Super Meat Boy.

Best of all, this game is HARD. It separates the men from the boys (and the women from the boys too), and it is not hard because the levels were poorly built. It is hard because you **** at games. All in all Super Meat Boy is the best game to come along on XBLA in ages.",10,10

metacritic,Mendyc,oneshot,"You know, when I sat down to play OneShot, I expected a typical cute indie game with a simple plot. Metanarrative always seemed to me to be just a fun gimmick, like sometimes making the player the main character of the game, but it usually works as a paranoid horror. A great example of this is Doki Doki Literature Club. However, OneShot makes the player not just part of the narrative; it creates such an emotional connection with the main character that it’s hard to describe in words. YOU are the one talking to Niko throughout the game, and I don’t mean conversations about saving the world, but dialogues about your life. This sets OneShot apart from all other games with metanarrative and makes its ending even more heart-wrenching.
Unfortunately, there are no other games like this. Games that are entirely built on breaking the fourth wall without using it for horror elements. The game’s title is completely justified. OneShot - one chance, which means it can’t be replayed. Essentially, each copy of the game is personalized, as it communicates directly with you. As for the other elements of the game, they are superbly executed. The soundtrack captivates you right from the menu screen. Just listen to the main menu music “My Burden Is Light”. By the way, this piece is a reference to the Bible, as are many other elements of the game. The atmosphere of a dark, dying world gives a sense of hopelessness. And since you are playing as just a child, this feeling is amplified a hundredfold.
In conclusion, neither Spec Ops: The Line, nor Soma, nor Nier: Automata, nor The Last of Us, nor even the hundreds of other games I have played have captured my heart as OneShot did.
OneShot is not just a game; it’s a deep emotional experience that leaves a mark on the heart of anyone who decides to play it to the end. At the very least, because you will remember this story along with Niko.",10,10

First: the mapping in general is between cumbersome and lazy; most world graphics are copy pasted dozens of times and the geometry is very repetitive to the point of just having to scan the map in a mechanical manner to cover it all without making a mistake at just checking it all. Secondly the game takes itself way to seriously in terms of wanting the player to restart the game; they added an alternative long ending after it was released on stream which implies you really love replaying a large part of it; they should have kept it at the original design [happy endings aren't always necessary in good stories anyway].,7,10

metacritic,Critic887,oneshot,"This game is just amazing. It`s more than a game. The musing and sound are amazing and the main Character, Niko is just so cute and you will love him/her at the end of the game. The story is exciting and mysterious and the puzzles are not too difficult. If you´re stuck it´s probably because you haven´t explored the whole area or not talked to every NPC. And some puzzles forces you to think out of the box. But the best thing about this game is that it breaks the 4th wall in just an amazing and unique way. I´m not going to spoil how but i was very surprised in a positive way.
But this game also has downsides. It´s rather short (My full and blind playthrough took about 7 hours) and if you hate puzzles I think that this is not the right game for you. And don´t expect an Open-World.
However I still think that this game is amazing and I highly recommend this to everyone especially during a Steam Sale. The price is 10€ and 5€ during sales (I believe that the price for USA/UK is also 10 Dollars/Pounds but I could be wrong)",10,10
metacritic,Alex2002ita,oneshot,"A hidden masterpiece that (un)fortunately didn't received all the attention it deserved due to being overshadowed by Undertale (don't get me wrong, UT is a masterpiece too) in it's period, but even today it's still a great game that I highly recommend to play especially if you are into games with a meta narrative like I do, because this game has freaking NAILED this type of narrative.
Now, I don't want to go too much in detail because I'm lazy and I don't want to heavily spoiler the game, so I'll sum up with pros and cons (yes, this game has cons, of course).

Pros:
-Niko (The Not Cat), the main protagonist, is one of the most likeable characters I've ever seen in a videogame (and it's really cute, too);
-Great soundtracks, maybe a little bit too short especially for some parts of the game, but still really nice to listen while doing puzzles and following the story;
-Graphics simple but gorgeous with really good drawn cut-scenes;
-Slow pace but since it's an entertaining puzzle-story driven game it's perfectly fine to play;
-Game mechanics are fun to play with, especially the item one which you've to combine items in order to progress or equip a specific item to unlock new dialogues and interactions;
-Unique and mind-blowing 4th wall breaks I never saw in a videogame before (not even Undertale) that perfectly goes along with the story;
-Perfectly done environments that clearly shows you how the world is really decaying, combined with the general melancholic tune the soundtracks have;
-Nice looking npcs and main characters in general;
-Challenging and interesting puzzles, not too easy and stupid but not too difficult either;
-Well designed and big but not dispersive maps. Everything will connect at some point;
-Addicting (emotionally too if you're that type of player like me), interesting and detailed story that not only uses the 4th wall break mechanic to it's finest, but it immerse YOU, The Player, to the point you're just the second protagonist alongside with Niko. In the end you'll probably cry.

These are all the pros I can recall now.

Cons:
-Limited and tile by tile only movement, both respectively meaning that you can't walk diagonally if not by doing a zig-zag type of movement (which it could be quite annoying at times because some parts of the game require you to move diagonally) and pressing a movement key even for a split second will result in Niko moving from a whole tile to another one, so no precise movements. All of this can sometimes give the feel that there's input lag;
-Even tho it's explained a little bit why later in the game, it's quite sad that we can't get to know more about most of the characters;
-A map. A FREAKING MAP PLEASE. Not necessarily a minimap like those in GTA and similar games who tells you everything, but at least one that when you discover a place that you can't interact with yet because you miss an item, it marks that place for you so you can come back easily and not get lost when you obtain that missing item. I managed to loose an hour in The Barrens in my first run because of this. I know there's fast travel but still a map assistant wouldn't hurt the game experience;
-The photography puzzle is too subject-specific IMHO, like if you don't know at least the basics of that subject (which is totally possible, I don't know anything about photography) you would end up searching on Internet for a solution.

And these instead are all the cons I can remember, which even if there are a few, they don't hurt the experience that much and are forgivable.

In the end, should I suggest this game? Absolutely YES.",9,10

metacritic,Pimplup,oneshot,"I loved this game. The fourth wall breaks were very entertaining, and the relaxed soundtrack along with the lovely pixel art gave it a unique, comfy atmosphere. If you liked Undertale, I'd highly recommend giving this one a try.

My one complaint is about the gameplay. In order to progress, you need to collect items scattered throughout each area, so if you miss one it can be a pain in the butt to repeatedly scour the land to find it. It was tedious for me having to consult a walkthrough regularly, but the way the plot developed made it all worth it.",10,10
metacritic,Dardevid,oneshot,"Sono basito. Letteralmente. Il fatto che questo gioco non sia noto a livello mondiale e che non abbia un punteggio superiore a 90 su Metacritic mi disarma.

Questo gioco è un'esperienza unica, che ciascun videogiocatore degno di chiamarsi tale dovrebbe provare almeno una volta... Inizialmente il giocatore si ritrova spiazzato, totalmente confuso dall'ambiente che lo circonda e la surreale atmosfera, fattore determinante in un iniziale calo del giocatore all'interno di Niko. Niko.
Diamine, quanto è toccante questo gioco. Nella mia esperienza videoludica, solamente una volta ero riuscito ad instaurare un tale rapporto con un ****, trovandomi a scervellarmi per ore su scelte morali non indifferenti.
Una colonna sonora che merita, seppur non eccelsa, gameplay innovativo e coinvolgente al massimo, comprendente la risoluzione di enigmi tramite l'utilizzo del PC. Come punto a sfavore, ho trovato che tutti i **** al di fuori del protagonista siano troppo poco caratterizzati: passano troppo in secondo piano. Certo, ciò favorisce l'introspezione e l'accrescimento del rapporto con Niko, ma secondo me sarebbe stato migliore un maggiore approfondimento sui **** secondari.
Trama che culmina in un finale stupefacentemente commovente ed intenso, che ha fatto in modo che One Shot salisse sul podio dei miei giochi favoriti.

Dategli una possibilità, saranno i 10 euro (quasi) meglio spesi della vostra vita",9,10
metacritic,ojitosgames,oneshot,"this game haves 2 versions so they will be here both but separated but both have the same basis:

You are the guide of Niko in a dying world where a frail light bulb its the only hope of everything going back to the good days instead of an eternal night

Steam version: First of all no permadeath so you can replay it of even finish it in more than one go but there is more.

This game is really immersive sometimes it stops feeling like a game and it becomes a whole emotion or experience.

Beautiful artwork it may be a pixel graphics game but any cinematic will charm you.

Experience and what to expect: You will be a  guide, you will have control over Niko's actions  and you will get to love him in the depths of your heart, you may cry or smile and you will certainly feel the pressure and anguish of some of your actions but you will feel at ease. It destroys the 4th wall and draws you to the game world

Personally: i am not a fan of history based games, i tend to skip it like i did with bioshock but this one  is beautiful, the soundtrack now haves an emotion linked to it, and i deeply care about this game.

Important note: be sure to ask in the community anything that bugs you, you may be incorrect and discover a new part of the game that you wouldn't had if you enclose in the frustration.

Any indie page that is not steam:

its made with RPG-maker so the inventory its pretty lame and it breaks some immersion.

Experience: interesting, deep and most importantly YOU can really screw this up. a sense of responsibility and it will make you care a lot, all the character feel like they act natural towards everything helping a lot to the inmersion.

i strongly recommend this game (especially the steam version) but i cant say much because this is one of the games that if you don't go blind to play it it is not the same good experience",10,10

Don’t look up story spoilers, and you’ll find this game pulling on all of your heartstrings.

The gameplay itself is simplistic (outside of a few special puzzles), but it was entertaining for the time I spent on it. It’s only a few hours’ worth of material, anyway, so I feel it’s worth playing for the story alone. This game had a lot of love put into it, and it will forever hold a place in my heart.

You only have OneShot at completing the game, if you loose, well then it was your fault and the game won't boot up again.

At the end of the game you get to choose between 2 decisions and afterwards you can't boot up the game again. That's it.

Now besides that I really liked the game. It occasionally breaks the fourth wall and has some neat puzzles.

metacritic,Megaxclaw,oneshot,"This game is downright amazing. I didn't think much of it at first (like most indie games with little-to-no promotion), but the more I played it the more I fell in love with it. In my opinion (my OPINION, keep that in mind), here's what makes it so great:

- It has the very uncommon trait of causing you to feel for the character(s). When they're sad, you're sad. When they're happy, you're happy. This helps so much in creating a bond between you and the main character.
- It has some of the coolest puzzle solving aspects (like making you solve puzzles with hints that it practically throws onto your desktop wallpaper or documents folder), while still maintaining a simplistic style of gameplay.
- The fact that the 4th wall is completely demolished is almost as amazing as both the way they put YOU in the game, and that it makes perfect sense how you're involved.
- The story seems pretty generic and cliche at first, but then slowly evolves into something much more amazing. Then, it somehow tops that as well.
- Practically half of what makes this game amazing, is it's wonderful retro/indie soundtrack. Every piece of this original soundtrack perfectly fits the environment or situation that you are in, and makes it memorable enough that I can easily remember the area I was in JUST from hearing the music alone.
- The little details that it adds each time you play it, make this game so amazing.

This game broke the 4th wall, broke my heart, and best of all broke my expectations. Without a single doubt in my mind, I give this a 10/10.",10,10
metacritic,Himeji,oneshot,"This game is not to be disregarded as another adventure RPG Maker game. This is a story-driven RPG that employs meta elements from the start. Similarly to Undertale, the player is a character in the game, but this game pushes this concept to another level, completely involving the player in the story. The game contains an amazing and original art style, and great soundtrack to go with it.
The one thing that prevented me from giving this game a 10/10 is that the characters aren't very deeply developed, aside from Niko, the protagonist alongside the player. Their interactions start to become interesting, but are very brief, and you'll never see those NPCs again, making their short development almost pointless.
That aside, this is a wondeful short game that will offer a unique experience even to those accostumed to story-driven RPG games, and I heartly recommend it as one of my personal favourites.",9,10
metacritic,PointR,oneshot,"This game gave me exactly what I was expecting: an excellent story coupled to a weak and classic gameplay, exactly like Undertale, featuring outdated controls concerning movements. Tile-by-tile with no diagonals is very annoying. Even the character is annoying, constantly asking you to help him for insignificant things such as sleeping. He's not a five years old crybaby! Let's not forget that it's ""recommended to play in windowed"", but a resolution of 800x600 is too small to be actually playable. This and the fact it takes your session's name, write files in your documents and not in its own folders, and change your wallpaper(s) without your consent. What next? A game that deletes random files if you're not completing it fast enough? The music, though it's nice, is basic and repetitive. I could name every samples and effects present in it.

Pros:
-Story.
-Graphics.
-Fourth-wall breaking puzzles.
-Ending

Cons:
-Two characters (The Guide a.k.a You + Niko which you only guide for certain actions.)
-Basic gameplay if you remove these special puzzles.
-Lack of instructions at the very begining (The first item use is... ****.)
-Pause mode does not exist.
-Going back to windowed mode all the time...
-...so you have to deal with a tiny resolution (Must be a pain in the a** with 4K monitors.)

If you're looking for a great story, a nice fourth-wall breaking experience, an epic final puzzle, and a very tough final choice: go for it. But this game is like Undertale: a great story with a poor gameplay. I wouldn't recommend this game which is not worth its current price tag of 10€. Maybe if it was sold 5€ I would recommend it (And it's sad to say that.)",4,10

metacritic,SaucyLettuce,oneshot,"OneShot is an RPG maker game, but it stands above the rest. With beautiful atmospheric music and little sounds when you do anything that really get you immersed in the world. It makes you care. This game is like if Pixar made a game - it tugs you right in the heartstrings. While the game does have a few bugs, they don't detract from the game or prevent it from going on. Just don't expect to get the One Shot steam achievement. After I played the game through the first time, I thought ""oh boy was that a feels train"" Definitely worth the $10",10,10

metacritic,timeknight,oneshot,"This game does not live up to its potential.
Cons:
- Lackluster characters. The relationships feel hollow and pointless. The only slight exception is the main character, but even then they're mostly a puppet that simply says yes to everything you tell it to do.
- Lackluster music
- Lackluster story
- No real consequences to your choices
- This is not an adventure game at all
- It only takes 3-4 hours to play through everything
- There are blatantly unfinished aspects and areas that the developer claims will be added in later.

Pros:
- They do some interesting ""meta"" things.

Other than the meta elements of the game, there's really not much going for it. It's an OK game, but I certainly can't give it more than a 4/10. It only took me 4 hours to play through it.",4,10

My dude all you gotta do is go to My Documents/My Games/Oneshot and delete the file that says ""oneshot save data"" LMAO not that hard. The game spells that **** out for ya near the end and you still **** it up sorry bro but you're the problem there.

Gud game btw. Doesn't have much in the way of character development outside Niko but the world feels cohesive, the lore is rich, and it has you doing stuff that makes you question whether you're doing the right thing. The music is understated but pretty and compliments the atmosphere of the game. However, the gameplay (excluding the fourth wall breaking puzzles which are really creative and cool actually) is simple almost to a fault and feels like a bunch of fetch quests. Overall, just a modest and pretty title from an indie dev that will pull on your heartstrings. Buy it!",8,10

The core gameplay loop was very challenging and enjoyable, the additions of new rules constantly kept the gameplay fresh and challenging without being overbearing.

The music was servicable, the graphics were charming and the atmosphere was stellar.

To me, there is only one thing keeping this game out of masterpiece territory. its endings.

The game builds up to essentially nothing, each one of the 20 endings are just glorified slide shows, lamely dictating the future events.

metacritic,FuriousAegon,papers-please,"For me, this game is one of the most interesting indie experiences in years. Firstly, I had only one expectation: that this game would be like a border control simulator, and my god, how wrong I was.Firstly, there's a huge lore behind this game about dictatorship and totalitarianism. It kind of reminded me of images of **** Germany that I used to see in some videos. It was interesting to see how Lucas Pope would replicate that system and implicate it in border control. In terms of lore and somewhat plot, it was interesting to play, experiencing the job of a border inspector. Seeing all these people and really forgetting about empathy because your family and future are at stake.Gameplay was also interesting for me, even though in most cases, it is point & click. But there are some details that bring depth to gameplay. Almost every 3 days of the game, there are new details to gameplay, conditioned by the situation in Arstotzka. For example, there's a new disease in a neighboring country; that is why all people crossing the border need a special medical certificate showing that they've taken the vaccine against this disease. In terms of gameplay, it adds another document that the player needs to check to let tourists pass. And there are a lot of documents in this game that you need to check: passport, country tickets, body documents, employment documents, and more. Even though this is an interesting system, and in the first 20 days, it was interesting to play, but in the last days, the huge complexity of documents makes the gameplay very complicated and, in some parts, boring. But it is my experience; I understand that it is very realistic, but this type of huge complexity is not for **** summary, I really enjoyed this game. This was a pleasant 6 hours of thoughtful gameplay and full of amazing situations. I can't wait to play Lucas Pope's newest game, ""Memories of Obra Dinn."" The last thing I want to say about ""Papers, Please"" is that I really enjoyed the legend of this game - Jorji Costava.8/10",8,10

metacritic,MaTToM,papers-please,"The mere idea of creating a game like this is absurd, personally it would never have occurred to me, both brilliant and senselessly ""stupid"". In short, coming home from work and ""playing"" a game in which you have to check document after document of people who want to cross the border all day and for months at a time, and we are in fact their pass, is truly a senseless thing. . We could define it as Lucas Pope's first work even if in fact it is not his first project. It is certainly the title that made it famous as well as a game that caught my attention to the point of buying it without too many hesitations. To be honest, I had some doubts which, however, quickly disappeared when faced with a work that was extravagant but well cared for and finished. Documents **** work we are led to do is simple to understand but very complicated to master. Every day we should check the documents for all the people in line and verify that all the information is correct. We will also verify that all the certificates are presented to us and that depending on the instructions we have received from the headquarters, the transfer of citizen data is permitted. The control procedure gradually becomes more difficult as there will be increasingly stringent checks, more documents to verify and, depending on the type of applicant who presents themselves at the border, whether foreign or one of our fellow citizens, we should behave differently. The days pass quickly and we should become more and more skilled and efficient in processing as many documents as possible, as our salary at the end of the day will depend on it. Allowing a citizen who did not have all the documents in order to pass through or denying access to those who were entitled to them will result in penalties which will affect our pay and which could therefore put us in a particularly difficult financial situation. This is because the game places an entire family on our shoulders that needs us, rent to pay, food and medicine needs and therefore even just five credits more or less makes all the difference in the world. All in one **** we proceed with the story we will find ourselves overwhelmed by documents, files, certificates, nameplates, passports, identity cards, business cards and more and we should be able to keep our workstation in order and manage it in the most correct and efficient way. The state of Arstotzka provides us with all the tools to work in the most correct way: from the documentation that contains all the key data to carry out our task, to the clock that shows the current date and time, to a platform that controls the weight of the access seekers, right down to our trusted ""stamps"", which allow you to validate or reject a passport. Without forgetting that a tool will come to our aid that will allow us to verify the actual validity of the data passed to us, comparing them and reporting any inconsistencies, so useful that we would almost end up abusing it needlessly. Making everything fit on the counter will be a challenge, that's why we have to bring out the accountant in us, sharpen our eyes, open our ears and always be on the alert because it's a moment for the border to be attacked by terrorist groups who want to overthrow our state or by vile smugglers who try to pass off everything by hiding it everywhere. Roguelike?Poor choices made on any given day can lead to dire consequences. It will be a moment to go against the orders of our superiors and find ourselves, together with our family, in prison and trigger the gameover. Fortunately, the game allows you to choose whether to start over on that given day or whether to start much earlier in order to avoid a tragic ending. If we really don't get out of it because we are stuck in a dead end, it is possible to opt for a drastic choice and start the game again from day one. It's a difficult choice but in the end also the only one! I like to think that in this way we would give birth to a sort of multiverse in which a small part of us will remain trapped **** a musical level there are few tracks and they all revolve around the main theme of the game. On the other hand, music is not allowed in the workplace in **** the full review come and visit us on ****",8,10

metacritic,Young_Fawn,papers-please,"Great Indie Title That's Still Fun 10 Years On

Papers, Please is a game about border control. You assume the role of a man who has won the labour lottery and is essentially in charge of who gets into the country.

The game is set in a sort of fictional communist state named Arstotzka and you work at the border between Arstotzka and Kolechia, however people of other fictional nationalities show up as well for a multitude of reasons.

The gameplay loop at its core is that you get an immigrant or a native come to your checkpoint and they give you their documents, your goal is to check the passport and any other documents (Vaccination passes, Workers Passes, Entry Permits) to see if it's all in order. If it's all in order, you let them in, if it's not, you hit them with the deny stamp.

As the game progresses you'll need a much keener eye for detail as more documents and regulations are introduced, even little things like forged stamps and weight and height and very minor spelling mistakes in the names will qualify them for denial. You will miss these on occasion and be given a citation for it.

The characters, some recurring but most aren't, are what makes the game. You'll find some of them absolutely hilarious and adorable (Jorji Costava) and others utterly repulsive and unpleasant. This plays alongside the storyline, which progresses with each passing day. Accepting bribes for extremist groups to let people through, denying people for bogus reasons etc,

My only criticism is that some of the names are properly slavic, which is fine but it fits with the theme, but sometimes I felt like the game slighted me a bit by giving me a 9 + 9 surname and forename, everything looks fine but it turns out they were missing an ""i"" on one of their four documents. Although, in all fairness, I guess I should've been more thorough. The only other thing is the Worker Passes, there's only four permitted stamps but to me they look more or less all the same, I always felt that one was a bit unfair.

All in all, Papers, Please is a fantastic game and you'll feel good about yourself when playing it. It makes you feel pretty smart when you confidently let someone through but even smarter when you notice just the slightest, smallest discrepancy in their papers. It's definitely worth a shot and in my opinion, even fun to watch.

9/10, Free my boy Jorji.",9,10

Con una historia que te atrapa, una jugabilidad exquisita y satisfactoria (aunque en ciertos momentos puede resultar algo complicada) y con una ambientación espectacular, se puede observar en el juego un gran cariño por parte de su creador, Lucas Pope. Además, su diseño artístico es muy bueno y, a pesar que quizá no es el pixelado más vistoso de todos, pega perfectamente con la temática del juego. Cabe destacar que a pesar de su corta duración (a mi me duró unas 2 horas y media), el juego es muy rejugable y hay un modo para jugar sin historia (sin que haya un final),  que recomiendo especialmente a quienes les haya gustado la jugabilidad.

Papers Please ist ein Einzelspieler-Rätselspiel aus dem Jahr 2013, dessen Grafik und Sound direkt aus dem Jahr 1985 stammen könnten. Doch was macht dieses Spiel aus? Der Grund liegt darin, dass es viel mehr ist als ein simples Rätselspiel. Das Basis-Gameplay an sich ist einfach. Ihr müsste als Grenzbeamter Pässe kontrollieren. Aber mit jedem Tag kommen neue Regeln und dadurch Komplexität hinzu. Dabei erzeugt das Spiel eine beklemmende Stimmung und einen latenten Druck, es in einem Überwachungsstaat allen Recht zu machen. Das Spiel macht nicht nur richtig Spaß, sondern es regt auch zum Nachdenken über das eigene Handeln an. Großartig!

metacritic,levoxyl,papers-please,"Really fun game. Has a great idea, gets harder every time with new rules. Has multiple endings that make it more interesting.",9,10
metacritic,YoBoyYo,papers-please,"Seeing all the positive reviews for this game, I was excited to try it. Little did I know that this would be one of the worst games I have ever played, and the only bad indie game I have ever played... Where to start?

GRAPHICS: The graphics are TERRIBLE. They were inexcusable even when they came out 10 years ago. This is very relevant as the game's core gameplay relies on the player being able to distinguish if a character is female or male, if their low-quality image matches the even more low-quality image on the passport, or if their finger prints matches the one on file. If the player cannot tell, they will get reprimanded or penalized. This is made worst by the fact that the player is always on a time limit...

GAMEPLAY: The gameplay is quite simply not fun. The concept had potential, but the developper clearly failed in making checking documents for errors fun. The whole process is very boring, lacks variety, and has time constraints that are too tight for its gameplay. The player is also never rewarded for getting anything right, while getting harshly penalized for any slight mistake. Maybe some minigames or more frequent rewards could have helped? The ironic thing is that I've worked this kind of job before in real life and it was way more fun than this. You know its bad when a real job is more fun than a video game lol.

CHARACTERS: Its impossible to remember any of the characters. The player has a family and is supposed to care about them, but we never see them or get know to know anything about them. Heck, they don't even have names! As such, the player is not compelled to care about them, and instead feels encouraged to kill them off so they use up less money. When it comes to characters seen at the border crossing, the graphics are so bad that it can be easy to mix up the procedurally-generated characters with the plot-relevant or secondary characters. None of them are memorable dialogue-wise as there is very little dialogue at all and all of them speak the same way. As such, what always happens is that a character show up, says a few sentences, and then a few minutes later after they've left, you've already forgotten about them or what they wanted. Because its so easy to forget, the player often misses opportunities, which is frustrating. The only exception I've found is one character that keeps returning to your station every odd day or so, submitting obviously false documents, and who is present from the start. Although, I still don't remember his name. The antagonists of this story -representatives of the Arstostka government - suffer from these same problems. They do not stand out visually or personnality-wise, and you rarely see them or learn about them. They should have gotten at least a theme song. The player should have learned about the atrocities they commit in general or on other characters throughout the story to build tension.

PLOT: The plot is very difficult to follow and not engaging. This is partly on purpose, as you are supposed to be a border guard with no real insight into the secret EZIC organisation. But, the game is just not clear enough about what is going on. There was one day, for example, that a member from this organisation told me to kill someone in red in the line, but a random terrorist attack interrupted the workday before this red person got to me. The next day they were gone and I never heard from EZIC again. What happened?? Another day, I was asked to let someone specific through, but they never came! Furthermore, there is nothing original about this plot. You guess everything from the start: you have your evil government, and a secret rebel organisation that wants to topple it. There is nothing more to it than that unfortunately.

LORE: This game features fictional countries but never goes into the history or culture of any of them. There is no lore. Is Arstostka at war right now? Does Obristan actually have better living standards? What are even Arstoska's relationships with these other countries like? We will never know, and the absence of any lore is the biggest missed opportunity of this entire game.

MUSIC: This OST has only 3 songs: the main theme, the death theme, and the victory theme. I hope you like the main theme, because that's all you'll hear the entire game playing over and over again for 5 hours.

IN SHORT, this is a bad game. The positive reviews are truly baffling to me. It seems most of them believe this game is being innovative by purposefully giving you a **** experience - to mirror the experience of working a bad job, or in a soviet country. Unfortunately, they are simply pretending the game's flaws were intended or good somehow. This setting could have been ""oppressive"" and still fun, but it was just not executed well. It was never necessary to have bad graphics, no music, boring gameplay, unmemorable characters or a predictable plot in order to have an authentic soviet experience either.",1,10

metacritic,skdcraw,papers-please,"Let's review why Papers Please is a great game.

First of all, when we look at it from the point of view of art design, I have to say that I found it very successful. Although the game seems to have gone cheap here by not showing us much else, in fact, this is a part of this suffocating life concept. Same day, same desk, same job. In addition, although it is a game where you can count the pixels, I found it successful that this dark soviet atmosphere could somehow be put into the game. The audio, on the other hand, do not bother you at all, although you do not search for their music on the Internet after the game.

The gameplay is a little different. Yes, games are starting to tend to more ""selling"" jobs. If you remember, a few years ago, almost everyone was making ""battle royale"" style games. Because that concept was returning to game makers as ""guaranteed money"". So you don't want to engage in such risky business while making a game. Because you never know how many players it will gather. Papers Please, on the other hand, did not gravitate towards this populism, and officially appeared before us as a game where you play as a ""border-crossing immigration officer"". It would be absurd to expect everyone to have fun in this role. However, I think this game, combined with a story, gameplay and art design that will definitely do justice to this role and attract the player, is very confident in attracting you. The game just starts with you checking the provided documents and determining if people can cross the border. However, the game develops in such a way that after a point you have the authority to arrest, ask questions and even use a gun. While doing all these, you need to take care of your family and be careful about money. In addition, the fact that the game offers you different endings as a result of your different actions, even though you hardly speak, is really impressive for a game in this budget.

Our story, on the other hand, is one that avoids being very serious, but at the same time makes you feel important. What's the worst that can happen to a border-crossing immigration officer? You will be surprised at what happens to you after you ask the question. In addition, the game does not stand idle, except for the main scenario, and it brings a different tone of people to you. Perhaps you've seen the most prominent ""Jorji Costova"" on the internet. I can say that Papers Please has a really satisfying story, along with this character that makes you laugh at once, and perhaps the pathetic story that follows it.

It is certain that it does not appeal to every player, but I invite you to play this game, thinking that it would not be wrong to say that the players who play by paying attention to the plot will leave with pleasure.",8,10

metacritic,F3T1W,papers-please,"An ingenious project, does not get bored until the very end, moral choices, bribes and, of course ... George",9,10
metacritic,Aiatin,papers-please,"Educational software has come a long way over the years. Papers, Please should be required gaming for every middle school student. It teaches many important life skills. It teaches the importance of attention to detail. It presents difficult, and often no-win, decisions to make. And most importantly, it lets someone know how dreadful of a career a low-level clerical position can be, which should be enough to instill a drive to succeed into any student.

Papers, Please's game-play is centered around faces versus the faceless. You, a border entry agent of a vaguely totalitarian state, are a faceless character working for the glory of a faceless nation, and between days at work, you get a spartan budget sheet accented with the current maladies afflicting your faceless family members. Wife, Son, Mother-in-law, and Uncle will probably be indicated as living in your state-assigned dwelling, and till you play enough to know what to do and quickly, also probably be indicated progressively as cold, hungry, sick, and so on. Between these intermissions, you're doing the gig: Looking at the faces of entry applicants, their paperwork in the manner prescribed by your faceless superiors, and hopefully determining correctly if everything is in order. If not, you'll get a citation while the next applicant enters your booth. In addition to the regulations stacking up, so do also complications in the forms of spies, guards, authorities, and revolutionaries all looking to use you to achieve their personal goals. Meanwhile you're fundamentally just wanting to know if you should use the green stamp or the red one. Citation rates, with whom you do and don't cooperate among those who would manipulate you, and which applicants you admit, rebuff, or entrust to the border guards determines the fate of you and yours, and perhaps the whole nation.

Most of the playtime is in your checkpoint booth, which is presented in three sections: A first-person look at the applicant, a cramped workspace for examining documents, and an exterior camera showing the line of applicant silhouettes, a few guards, and maybe something exciting once in a while. Graphics are deliberately low-fidelity, and usefully so. It limits the amount of variation in appearances that are possible, preventing tiny details from becoming suspicious beyond what's warranted, and serves as a good stand-in for grainy and terrible passport photos. The mechanisms for interrogation, such as inquiring why an applicant's stated duration of stay and duration granted by a permit differ is quick and effective, though a few circumstances aren't as clear about where the player must click to activate the right comparison, and some things that seem comparable simply aren't. Given that the game is presented in the form of a series of days on the job, having a first timer's ""training week"" option as a non-consequential prelude to the story mode would've saved a new player a lot of familiarization fumbling, and after the initial mechanics shock, the game then falls into a pattern of adding one complication a day, so it seems like starting with one instead of starting with a half dozen would've both fit the game design strategy and smoothed introduction to the game. Instead, you'll just have to trial-and-error the first session or two and work through it like certain 8-bit classics.

And work it is. I believe this game will be either a big hit or a big miss for a given player depending on how much entertainment that person finds in being challenged by ""spot the difference"" kinds of puzzles. If that's your flavor, Papers should offer hours, if not limitless, enjoyment. But otherwise, it's quite a chore. It feels like amusing classwork, which is why I see it as a great educational game, or as a paper-thin slice of an actual job, a job that should pay actual money for being done. There seems to be an interesting story of political intrigue and human suffering that the player only sees through the one square meter window of the visa check booth. Profound, and I somewhat want to watch that movie. Instead I'm wondering if a nine-character passport serial is a discrepancy to investigate as all the others I remember were ten, and I operate knowing that what I'm seeing is important outside of my booth but ultimately all I'm here to do is to stamp red or green. And when one of my decision paths led to my agent being arrested, I felt liberated. Perhaps there should be a second part to the game in that case, of breaking rocks in a gulag. It could then rival Desert Bus for retelling the punishment of Sisyphus.

For smart kids with time for non-mindless gaming, or if you dig scrutiny puzzles and/or choose your own adventure games, for you I stamp this green. But if you already work a tedious job, have real life bureaucratic paperwork to deal with using your ""free"" time, or aren't amused by ""gotcha!"" game mechanics, consider stepping away from this booth. The glory of Arstotzka might not be for you.",6,10
metacritic,That_Normie7,papers-please,"Papers Please smirks an interesting premise, set in a fictional Russian region known as Arstotzka, you assume the role of a border agent. One weakness of this game would be that it doesn't really give you much reason to try and earn as much to keep your family alive. I simply played for the sake of immersion. I also loved how the game always added new challenges and rules, by the end of the game, it was one of the most challenging games I've played in a while without having to fire a gun. The game surely isn't superb being that it doesn't drive you any further than your first journey and the ending, while being 20 of them, falls short. Regardless, Papers Please is worthy of Glory to Arstotzka",8,10

I really like this game , however it is an acquired taste .

I personally love the feeling of hopelessness and insignificance it instils in you from the very beginning  , as you know that those above you couldn't care less about you , As for the actually gameplay - it is often laborious ( it can a lot of the time be rather stressful though )once you are experienced enough with it - forcing your mind to wonder as you contemplate what life must be like for you and of the stories you have heard from travellers . It forces you to make complicated moral decisions when processing . Its very layout makes your working area feel cramped and inadequate - making your feelings of stress amplified .

metacritic,PublicNuisance,papers-please,"I wanted to like Papers Please. I liked it’s theme and attention to detail but it went too far. It crossed from having to be attentive to straight up sadism. It quickly became a chore of having to watch out for too many different variables and the punishments stacking up. One could say this is realistic to life in a totalitarian country but in the end games are still supposed to be fun. I liked how you have to pick what to spend what money you have and deal with the consequences. I enjoyed having to check regional maps for cities of issue. I found the buttons to interrogate and to check correlated data a bit clunky which is a bad thing when you’re on the clock. I think the game had a surprising amount of story and different endings based on various criteria.

I played Papers Please on Linux. It never crashed on me. It does require version 2.29 or higher of glibc so not every distro will run it. The game crashed on Trisquel due to this but ran on Manjaro. There is no manual save options, it saves at the beginning of each day. Alt-Tab works. There are no graphics options.

Game Version Played: 1.2.69

metacritic,Joellemm,papers-please,"The premise should be incredibly tedious, but because everything mechanically works so soundly, and there is such clear charm and personality brimming from the start, it is actually a brilliantly engrossing experience. Comparing documents in a dystopian, fictionalised, eastern European border control point is not all this game is - quite a mouthful in any case. The minimalist gameplay gets more complex in every level, without ever feeling unfair. Then there are the characters, some of them reappearing, the choices you're offered, the sudden attachment to nameless family members you're told exist that must be fed and potentially medicated. The political intrigue, terrorist subplot, and the eventual feeling that you're not simply a nameless immigration control worker, but that you're in the centre of it all. And this is just a brilliant achievement on the developer's part.",9,10

Di sicuro nessuna software house del mondo ci avrebbe scommesso un solo centesimo su un'idea del genere, ma la meraviglia del mercato indie è proprio questa: non si seguono le logiche del mercato o i gusti standardizzati del pubblico, ma si lascia libero spazio alla creatività.

Questo gioco è un CAPOLAVORO. Punto.
Volete farvi un'idea di com'era vivere e lavorare in un regime comunista? Delle conseguenze da pagare se si sceglie di supportare i dissidenti? Scegliere se pagare da mangiare o le medicine per il nonno? Un libro di storia non potrebbe spiegarvelo in modo altrettanto efficace. Bisogna viverlo. Sulla propria pelle.

metacritic,LT_Gruber,overwatch,"Good shooter, but too confusing for me in terms of visuals.

Overwatch is an Online FPS with a unique art style. It is fast paced, intense and reminds a bit of Team Fortress 2. 

In Overwatch, you can choose a trillion different heroes or characters to play as. You join one of the two teams and work together to complete a shared goal, while blasting away other players. It was actually a lot of fun, although I was (like many competitive shooters) not very good at the game.

The maps are fairly large and the many buildings, alleys and small areas make for a real witch hunt between players.

I always complain in some games, that graphics and art style are blend and could use a little more color, but Overwatch overdid it a bit in my humble opinion. There are more colors in one gun or character than in some entire games. This is not a bad thing normally, but in Overwatch, the many colors and different colored textures, made me not see enemy players very well. For me personally, they kind of blended in the surroundings sometime. I saw a street lantern with a bench in front of it, and emptied my gun, only to realize that I was seeing ghosts.

In terms of sound, Overwatch is all right. Guns sound fine, effects and explosions are good enough.

Overwatch controls very easily and smooth and the mechanics are easy to understand.

I am a little disappointed that games today just close their servers in favor of the next installment, forcing you to play and making the old game inaccessible. Blizzard is the prime example for this, in case the hint was not clear. Nothing lasts forever, but when you have some kind of solid player base, you should not do this.

After dying for the hundredth time, I was kind of done with Overwatch. It is not a bad game, but for me, it was just a little confusing, hard to read and overall, not that special. It also does not help that I just **** too hard for competitive online play.

In the end, I would recommend this game, if the servers were still up for the first game.",7,10

metacritic,M3t4tr0n,overwatch-2,"It is very likely that Overwatch 2 uses an Engagement Optimized rather than Skill Based matchmaking system. Skill Based Matchmaking (SBMM) aims to create matches where participants are grouped based on their measured proficiency. Typically, this involves employing a hidden Matchmaking Rating (MMR) that dynamically adjusts in response to match outcomes, such as wins and losses, and in some iterations, individual performance metrics. The primary objective of SBMM is to foster fair and competitive environments where players encounter opponents of comparable skill, ideally resulting in a roughly equal chance of victory for both sides. It has been claimed by Blizzard and promoted by corporate partners and pro (paid or sponsored) gamers that Overwatch 2 utilizes a simple SBMM.

Engagement Optimized Matchmaking (EOMM) focuses on player retention and engagement metrics rather than a strict adherence to skill-based pairings. EOMM systems intentionally manipulate matchmaking parameters to elicit specific emotional responses from players, by creating emotional highs through wins followed by lows through losses, with the goal of maintaining long-term investment in the game. These systems take into account factors extending beyond skill, potentially including a player's spending habits within the game, their recent patterns of play, and even algorithms predicting their likelihood of discontinuing play. 

A recurring concern among Overwatch 2 players is the experience of rank changes that appear inconsistent with their individual performance or overall win/loss record, fueling speculation about the implementation of an EOMM system. The game's Matchmaking Rating (MMR) system employs a forced normalized distribution, which concentrates a significant portion of the player base within the Gold and Platinum ranks. This can lead to inaccuracies in rank representation, negative experiences for players in lower tiers who may face frequent demotions, and an increased prevalence of alternative accounts in higher ranks due to the limited number of available slots in the top tiers.

At the commencement of each season, players are often dropped multiple rank tiers below where they concluded the previous season, while their underlying Skill Rank (SR) remains unchanged. This practice creates an artificial climb, leading to frustration as players feel compelled to grind back to their established rank each season. The explicit assertion that matchmaking prioritizes MMR over visible rank directly contributes to instances where players of disparate visible ranks are matched together. Many players report being consistently paired with teammates who are significantly less skilled, resulting in rank decreases despite their own strong individual performance. This has led to accusations that the matchmaking system is rigged to create “challenging” matches for high-performing players, ostensibly to maintain player engagement.  Content creators have also described experiencing matches where the skill disparity between opposing teams is substantial, spanning multiple rank divisions. This has led to questioning whether the MMR system is truly the primary factor in determining match pairings, as such wide skill gaps would seem unlikely under a purely skill-based system. The prevalence of matches characterized by one team being ""steamrolled"" or vice versa further underscores the perceived lack of balance.

The overwhelming theory prevalent within the Overwatch 2 community posits that the game's matchmaking system intentionally orchestrates losing streaks for players, potentially as a form of penalty for accumulating too many wins or as a tactic to manipulate player engagement by inducing frustration and the desire to regain lost progress. It appears in many cases that after a series of victories, the matchmaking system deliberately places them in matches with underperforming teammates to curb their win streak. The concept of a ""losers queue,"" where players who have won several games are subsequently placed with other players on losing streaks, is also frequently discussed. The potential motivations behind such a mechanism could include maximizing player engagement by keeping them on a ""rollercoaster"" of emotions, or preventing highly skilled players on smurf accounts from rapidly climbing the ranks, or simply aiming for a perceived sense of overall fairness by ensuring everyone experiences both wins and losses, such as with games of chance, or, more appropriately, gambling.

All in all, this is system has created an average of “overwhelmingly negative” reviews on various platforms. It may in fact be the main source of the proclaimed highly toxic player community, due to sheer frustration levels induced in it, which ironically Blizzard has begun addressing by way of a more robust violation reporting system, though it has ended up quite ineffective given the persistence or even increasing levels of toxicity.  Conclusively, this game *could*be great.",2,10

If I continue to play Mercy regardless of my opponent's insults, my opponent will report me for ""joining the queue with accounts marked as cheating"". If I stop cheering and wait for the match to end, my teammates will report me for ""not limited to, not participating in the game"".

It is a pity that the game coudn't deliver on their earlier promises of expanded modes such as PvE modes. Although what is present is very well made.

As far as live service, i feel it is very well supported (oct 2024). Patches come in a good cadence and devs do a good job wth communication with the community. Balancing is not perfect, (and never will in any competitive game) But there are enough changes so any greater inbanlance is smoothed out. For anyone that doesn't have much time; Cosmetic rewards from battle pass and events are not too much ****; you dont need to play every single day and feel like a chore. And the art for cosmetics in this gam is actually one of the few in the industry i actually think is worth paying for

Most of the negatives from my experience come from the competitive aspect; sometimes it is just frustating to deal with other players, theres tools for that but they just remedy it a bit. Also the game is very fast paced and learning or coming back to it after a while can feel overwhelming.

metacritic,eeman55,overwatch-2,"Overwatch: a game, of which innovative for its time of release, entails a fast, action-packed gameplay, involving “heroes” which you play with.  However, Blizzard released a second version Overwatch 2, which was created to mediate the decrease in the popularity of the initial Overwatch, which held promise. The initial stages of Overwatch 2 indeed increased the lost interest of Overwatch 1, especially during the initial stages of the sequels release, new maps, new characters. It could be said that it seemed promising. However, as time went on from the sequel’s release, more and more flaws, complaints arose from the sequel, mostly critiquing the main attraction of the game – the gameplay.  The main premise of Overwatch is for 2 teams to complete an objective, of which induces fights between these teams to progress their objectives. The main difference between Overwatch 2 and 1 is that the sequel has 5v5 instead of 6v6. Whilst superficially, it could be perceived as a novelty change to the game, instead this proved to be a major problem for the player base, and an even bigger problem for the “old” player base. This “flaw” consisted of the fact that they reduced the initial 2 tank roles to only 1 in role-based matchmaking, although in open queue they do not have this problem as there is not a cap in the roles. The decrease from 2 tanks to 1 tank led to drastic changes to the tanks’ stats and abilities, which is quite difficult to balance, whilst also decreasing the number of combinations in the heroes you can pick, making the “meta” (the current best combinations of characters) vastly more prominent definitive in if you win a match or not. One of the main charms of the initial Overwatch is the number of combinations of characters there could be, and the viability in each character, whilst there still being a main “meta”. But in the sequel, you would tend to see a repeat of the same characters depending on the viability of each character/ character combination, hence why I would rate Overwatch 2 a moderate level below the original game in terms of “fun” gameplay.  Overwatch 2 also boasts a variety of game modes apart from the main modes, unranked and competitive (ranked), and allow for community created game modes in the workshop. This allows for the community to create specific maps for aim, parkour, talking to others, and even trying to replicate RPG inside. Gameplay: 7.5/10  Learning Curve: Depends on what character you play. Enjoyability: Biased depending on whether you played Overwatch 1 or not. 6/10-9/10 Playability: Available on console and PC, also involves cross platform gameplay, allowing for better multiplayer experiences. 9/10 Replayability: 9/10; due to the 5–15-minute games for quickplay and 10–30-minute games for competitive. Nonetheless, apart from the gameplay, there has been moderate changes to the GUI, which could be, subjectively “cleaner” and more visually appealing, and quite interesting novel changes like “mythic skins”, which were decently well received by the community. They also changed Overwatch from paid access to free to play, albeit in the early stages of the sequel, still putting characters through a paywall - entailed a backlash.  Feedback response: 8/10 Graphics wise, Overwatch 2 retains most of its cartoony aspect that it had in Overwatch 1, not very high on the graphics, therefore easier to run on most platforms. It could be said that Overwatch is much more **** focused game rather than graphics, SFX, etc, therefore a lot less time is spent towards making the game “look better”, and more time is focused on balancing heroes.  Graphics: 7/10 Holistically, the sequel could be said to be a success, bringing in a new player base. However, Overwatch 2 currently is not on par Overwatch 1; commonly regarded as one of the greatest games of its time, period. Overall rating: 7.5/10.",7,10
metacritic,Saneperson356,overwatch-2,"Overwatch is a 5vs5 team-based tactical shooter with loads of well designed characters and maps that present an incredible level of depth of understanding and skill that provide thousands of hours of intense gameplay the character’s are designed very well with abilities revolving around different playstyles split up into three categories tank, dps and support each one playing a vital role in winning the game. However the balancing of these characters can be a little off and the community can be a little toxic even in game modes  that are not meant to be competitive this was not helped by the developers adding leavers penalty into quick play forcing everyone to stay in a one sided game against their will this can create an unfun and demoralising experience in a mode that is not meant to be taken seriously. This has created a weird dynamic where the unranked game mode is taken more seriously than the ranked game mode.  Talking about ranked the only game mode where you will actually have fun on this game spending countless hours trying to make an icon display on your profile showing that you are slightly better than the people with other icons on there profiles stroking your own ego and releasing slight amount of dopamine to then have it wear off after a day and instantly start trying to hit the next rank. Not to mention before you are even able to compete in ranked you have to sink a good couple hundred hours as overwatch is one of the more complicated e-sports Also the developers receive criticism for making overwatch 2 free to play this may not sound like a bad at first but it means blizzard has to make their money through micro transactions that are incredibly overpriced leading players to drop stupid amounts of money for skins they could of received for free simply by playing overwatch 1. However, if you look past these problems you get an addictive shooter with a good competitive scene and a passionate developers wanting the game to succeed.",8,10
metacritic,QAOSbringer,overwatch-2,"Overwatch 1 was one of the last good games Blizzard made. When Overwatch 2 was announced, we were hoping for a better version of Overwatch 1. It was said that it would be especially PvE focused. The most missing things in Overwatch 1 were story and scenario modes, we were excited that we would have the opportunity to play the background lore prepared for Overwatch 1 as singleplayer campaigns and taste that world. What came out was a cheap F2P version of Overwatch 1 that was dumbed down and slain with micropurchases. They didn't care to fix Overwatch 1's balance and matchmaking issues either, even worse, they messed up the ranking system further and removed important features. Everything worth playing Overwatch 1 has been thrown away in this second game.

They use the excuse that it is free to shove constant micro transactions and battle passes down your throat whilst offering out previously rare and difficult to obtain skins for purchase that players of the first game took pride in owning.

Players of the first game got no reward for their nearly $60 purchase, and blizzard just pocketed their money and moved on, as per usual.",4,10
metacritic,Kreepit,overwatch-2,"A management team who are completely disconnected from the community. They cater to content creators while ignoring the majority of their player base.

Cheating and smurfing is a massive issue in this game and it's made even worse when the cheaters in this game are allowed to run rampant for months before getting removed in a ban wave.

Then there's the horrible rank progression system and the way it works when someone leave a competitive match, which have insane consequences for the 4 players remaining on the team.

The game literally PUNISH players on the team if a random team member leave a competitive match by adding a loss to their account.

The rank progression system also remove more rank progress when you lose compared to what you gain when you win.

Whoever came up with such an outrageously bad system that punish those left on the team when someone leave a competitive match should be fired..

If someone tilts and rage quits a competitive match, the lobby should close down, with no change to anyone's rank progress and SR other than the idiot who left because their ego got hurt.

The matchmaker in this game is hands down the worst i've ever seen in any competitive games i've played since i started playing competitive shooters back in the very early Quake days.

All in all, for the vast majority of players who play in lower ranks, this is happening on a daily basis. Matchmaker matching bronze players with gold players where the game sense and mechanical skills of a bronze vs gold player is like night and day.

The rank division system is one that needs to be removed and revert the entire rank system back to OW1 standards with visible SR and more.",0,10

Und noch eine letzte Frage: Warum musste man die Lootboxen entfernen?  Overwatch war ein Vorzeigebeispiel von funktionierenden Lootboxen, die einem nicht das Geld aus der Tasche zogen, die Ingame gewonnen werden konnten und die nur Kosmetische Vorteile brachten.

metacritic,TokemonX,overwatch-2,"Game is filled with lots of 'relatable' shallow characters. The company had a chance to remedy this through cinematic cutscenes, more backstories, improved cgi for the pve  and less annoying shield Meta.

Overwatch really for years has fallen into the trap of 'if we can rebalance, lets do so' and made the game absolutely repugnant compared to when it released.

Tank is not fun and barely requires any skille now, theres no concept of retreating or even a way to escape, its mostly just 'help the tank' which every other team mate does. Its never been a 1v1 game, but it feel even less versatile now with no variation of which character to pick. This is insane to me and it ruins any way for now players to enjoy the game, this should only be reserve for competitive, but apparent ly blizzard did notunderstand not everyone wants to play that.

Pretty much everyone understands the big ass scam blizzard has made, making skins and herpes cost as much as a full game, so the 'free to play' is an illusion if you want to play the full game, unlike the old game where you could unlock New characters, skins, voice lines through free loot boxes.

Gameplay is still fun, but man, paying tank is so easy unless ur fighting a tank.

The zombification and basterdization of a title, just in the name of pure corporate greed, nothing more nothing less fellas.

But if your the kind of gamer who cares about getting better and learning how it works this is not for you.  The dev's have absolutely no clue what they are doing, and force horrible unfun meta's and regularly buff the most hated hero's the game has so they are the most viable ones.  Every unique hero's is left in almost an unplayable state for months at a time until they get a small buff and their win rate goes up so then they are nerfed again within 2-4 weeks if not instantly which does happen BTW (maybe because they are so min maxed that any change at all make is such a big deal due to unplayability of the particular hero ).  while other hero's dominate the meta for half a year or more.  That's the other problem they balance around win rate with no regard to what is fun to play or not which is mind blowing to me and the community.

metacritic,HonestGamerX,overwatch-2,"Overwatch 1 was a great game, it even won a GOTY.

This game is not even a shadow of what the previous one was, in fact, I call it Scamwatch 2.
From day 1 until today, abusive prices have been maintained in the store, the content for which they let OW1 die turned out to be all a lie and in its place they released a pack of very bad and boring missions in exchange for 3 years of silence and abandonment
The balance of heroes is fine, however, the game has a huge problem and for which it is doomed to die sooner or later.

The MatchMaking of the game is complete infectious garbage, it is totally intervened by Blizzard to keep people playing based on negative and positive stimuli.

It is programmed to force a 50% win ratio, no matter the player's skill, it is an automated algorithm that will manipulate your games until your ratio is exactly 50-50.

All games are a Stomp, you win or lose, but it is always by Stomp.This happens because the system needs to regulate your win rate, so your games are a **** festival, boring and frustrating.

For 10 seasons, the top has always been the same players, without a single variation, because the game keeps the players stuck in a rank and the same thing happens with the Top500, they are always the same, there is no point in trying to climb ranks or improve in this game since nothing depends on you, it is an entire system in the purest Slots style

This has caused the environment to become more and more toxic, to an unbearable point.

People are very frustrated and explode at the slightest comment, it is totally understandable since the system induces that.

The problem is that Blizzard did not plan all this well, they did not think that there is very good quality competition and that 90% of people would leave their game when they realized that it is a complete scam and is totally rigged.

Because of this, the game stays alive as best it can, but it will soon die and be forgotten. Every day it loses many more players than it wins and it is a matter of time before this happens.

Blizzard doesn't care, they only want to sell skins, they have made it clear by maintaining this invasive matchmaking system for 10 ****'t play this garbage, if you want a good hero shooter, there are others on the market in which you can demonstrate your skill and the games will depend on being better than the other team, not on a casino style algorithm that decides your games before you start.

metacritic,LT_Gruber,team-fortress-2,"Boring, repetitive and mind-numbing.

I don't know what happened exactly, but from all the Deathmatch classic games, I really hated Team Fortress 2. The graphics and ascetics, the gameplay loop and the combat itself.

Team Fortress 2 is a multiplayer only game in which 2 teams battle it out in different game modes. You got all the classics like King of The Hill, Capture the Flag, Deathmatch and some unique ones like Medieval Mode and Special Delivery. 

The principle is always the same. Blow up members of the enemy team and score the most points. There are different classes available, each with their own purpose and abilities. You got a Scout, Pyromancer, Medic, Engineer and many more. 

In theory, these classes and the way the game is supposed to be played, revolves around a balanced team with different members that, together with clever teamwork, can overpower the opponent. The medic heals teammates; the Heavies guard a certain exit etc. However, this game is all over the place. You pick a certain class, just go with the flow, and try not to die.

I have a special dislike for the cartoonish and jolly graphics in Team Fortress 2. Normally I can write whole lectures about what I didn't like, how bad the animations are etc. but with this game, I can't. I just think it looks ugly and that's it.

The sound effects and music are fine; they could be a lot worse. 

The controls are fluent, although sometimes it feels a little unresponsive. This, however, is mainly me who is not that great in Deatmatch shooters in general.

My biggest personal complaint about this game is the sheer chaos. I try to reach a place, follow an enemy or simply walk around and BAM, I am dead. Some turrets on a ledge pumped my @ss full of lead.  After respawning, my screen is obstructed with the fires of hell and a Pyro just burned me into a crisp.

Sure, I am not that great at Team Fortress 2, just like I am not that great at Call of Duty, CSGO and many others. The only difference is, I can enjoy those games, unlike Team Fortress 2.

In the end, I personally hated Team Fortress 2 and knew that this is not the game for me. It is too chaotic, blend, unrewarding and straight up boring (in my opinion).",3,10

A game that was abandoned, by it's own creators?
A game that was left to rot by the developers?
A game that was released 16 years ago on Oct 10th, 2007, loved since release, and is a huge profit for Valve earning them tens of millions of dollars each year?

Have you checked your game store page and saw that ""Overwhelmingly Negative"" with that metallic brown color for the first time in your 17 year run? with 12% of the 43,000+ reviews being positive since 3rd of June?
Have you scrolled down and read every single review of players expressing their experience with the current state of your game?
I bet no right?
Your game is on the #1 worst rated game and we thought Overwatch 2 was gonna be the #1 forever but seems like the tables have turned.

I have been playing this game for over 6 years now and althought I joined late, I had a really great and fun time playing this game, that was until the sniper bots with aimbots came and ruined the game making it almost unplayable..

This was problem since ""Meet your Match"" released, we are talking since 𝗝𝘂𝗹𝘆 𝟳𝘁𝗵, 𝟮𝟬𝟭𝟲 ALMOST 8 YEARS.

Cheating software will keep getting better and better overtime so if you wanna make history that will revolutionize online games make a good anti-cheat.

There are over 276,000+ players, HUMANS (still going up) are signing the petition, praying, hoping, wishing for a fix, an actual working anti cheat that bans bots and ends this once an for all!
Is just a matter of minuted that we reach the 279,499 petitions that World of Warcraft had and because of that Blizzard DID what the COMMUNITY ASKED FOR.

THIS BOT CRISIS IS A [𝗛𝗨𝗚𝗘] PROBLEM BECAUSE THEY ARE GOING AS FAR AS ILLEGAL CRIMINALS.

• Not only they are breaking your 𝗦𝘁𝗲𝗮𝗺 𝗦𝘂𝗯𝘀𝗰𝗿𝗶𝗯𝗲𝗿 𝗮𝗴𝗿𝗲𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁"" TERMS as you said ""You may not use Cheats, automation software (bots), mods, hacks, or any other unauthorized third-party software, to modify or automate any Subscription Marketplace process""
But this **** are also doxxing, swatting and also sending death threats to people who have tried bringing attention to the crisis in the past by this 𝗕𝗢𝗧 𝗛𝗢𝗦𝗧𝗘𝗥𝗦.
• They also have farm bots setup to get cases, cosmetics, weapons drops and even tho it cost a few cents like $0.03USD after a defined time just remember they are in their own VAC-secured server with 𝗧𝗛𝗢𝗨𝗦𝗘𝗡𝗗𝗦 of bots so now imagine how much money they are making and farming in this game.
• They have 𝗙𝗔𝗟𝗦𝗘𝗟𝗬 and 𝗜𝗟𝗟𝗘𝗚𝗔𝗟𝗟𝗬 filed a 𝗗𝗠𝗖𝗔 takedown impersonating you guys, VALVE on the **** website wish is the page that the petitions are signed, this is how far these kind of criminals would go to try and shut down a call from the community to do your job as developers of your product.
• And lastly the worst one yet bot hosters have started to make their bots to advertise 𝗖𝗛𝗜𝗟𝗗 𝗣*** AND YOU THINK THAT'S OKAY TO LET IT HAPPENED? NO! THIS IS YOUR GAME VALVE YOU ARE THE ONE RESPONSIBLE FOR LETTING THIS HAPPEND NOT ONLY THIS CAN MAKE THE GAME SHUT DOWN BUT YOUR ENTIRE COMPANY CAN SHUT DOWN BY U.S LAWS BECAUSE OF THIS BOT HOSTERS AND IT 𝗪𝗜𝗟𝗟 MAKE A HUGE IMPACT ON THE GAME INDUSTRY.

So basically what this criminals are doing is:
• Possession/Distribution of CP
• Swatting
• Extortion
• Doxxing
• DDoSing
• Scam
• Impersonation
• And much more....

WHAT WILL THE NEW PLAYERS, FUTURE GENERATIONS THINK WHEN THEY JOIN TF2 FOR THE FIRST TIME AND THE FIRST THING THEY SEE IS THIS BOT INFESTED UNPLAYABLE GAME?

DO YOU WANT THAT TO HAPPENED?
DO YOU WANT TO RISK YOUR ENTIRE COMPANY FOR THIS?
DO YOU WANT THAT TO BE RECORDED ON YOUR IP AND IMAGE OF YOUR COMPANY? OH SORRY YOU JUST DID BY REFUSING TO ANY EFFORT IN MAINTAINING THEIR GAMESBUT YOU GUYS ARE PERFECTLY FINE MONETIZING IT THOUGH!
FIX YOUR F****** GAME ALREADY!
- YOU CAN'T IGNORE US, YOU CAN'T AVOID US!
- Enough is Enough!
- Actions speak louder than words!
- It's time to put an end to this!
- Why keep lying!?
- OVER 6 YEARS OF AIMBOT TERROR, OVER 2 YEARS SINCE VALVE PROMISED TO FIX IT!
- Make our voices heard!
- LISTEN TO YOUR COMMUNITY!

And for the person reading this review that's right 𝗬𝗢𝗨 the player please, go to the 𝘀𝗮𝘃𝗲.𝘁𝗳 page and sign the petition to contribute to our call, ask your friends, loved ones and family to sign to let valve know how much people really want to play this game freely without worrying about the existence of 𝗕𝗢𝗧𝗦.
And also stop spending your money on Valve, by giving them money you are basically accepting that the current bot crisis in TF2 is okay but is 𝗡𝗢𝗧.

""""𝗖𝗼𝗻𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗻𝘁𝗹𝘆 𝘂𝗽𝗱𝗮𝘁𝗲𝗱"" with new game modes, maps, equipment and, most importantly, hats!""

You should be ashamed of yourself, why do you make a game of huge success and community with 9 years of development just to literally stab us on the back and let us die on the fire?

The bot problem that plagued Team Fortress 2 for so long and went unnoticed by the developers was also a very sad sight. Even after that, I can't bring myself to give a bad review to this great game.

metacritic,BoyBlue_Indo,team-fortress-2,"Its a hero/class team based game with variety of weapons, and hats.

I will start with positive one.

1. Its free,

2. In terms of gamelay, its pretty good for the most part. Each class/hero have different stats, different strategy to attacks or defends from the opposing team, and different ability . Every class/hero is already unlockable at the start of the game, so you can change the class/hero at any time as much as you want. There is also a sub-class, aka different version of the default. And if u ask how is the battlefield? It could be chaotic, I mean, very chaotic. And, there is a variety of  gamemode too, like capturing the intelligence(cta), push the cart thingy, capture the points, etc.

3. In terms of graphic, I think its okay. Its pretty cartonish with a little bit of gore to spice it up. I kinda like it.

Well, its time to talk about negative part of this game.

1. Bots. Bots are everywhere. Bots have aimbot. Bots are annoying if it doesn't get kicked sooner or later.

2. Then, if u want to use voice commands, or chatting in-game, you need to pay an items in-game first to use them. Which is annoying for most f2p players.

Thats all. Sorry if I have a bad grammar and a bad ""rating & critics"" about this game. But hey, since its free, you could try it first and give yourself a rating about the game.
Have fun :D",8,10

metacritic,RustY420,team-fortress-2,"A fallen game, that once was the all time banger, almost had his own TV show, but Valve could not agree with Adult Swim. Oh Valve... You magnificent Company, You created this game, back in October 10, 2007. I was 6 years old, sadly I only started playing Tf2 many years later. This is/was my all time favorite game, I have 1920 hours in this game, however, the Community is one of the toxic I ever saw. 

A dude started **** talking my family and none of the 98 more players did anything. I told him to leave me alone and ignored him. He started saying stuff like: ""How amazing is when he stopped speaking"" I asked him once again whats wrong with You? Then he continued bad talking, like ""Told you to shut up"". I joined the enemy team so i can, be with this manchild on one team to kick it. I did, he got kicked then I got bullied why i did that. After this the pink cloud was over. I realized this game is never gonna get new weapons, or anything from Valve. Just Imagine a story mode... Or stories to every character. Anything. But nothing will happen with this leaked spaghetti code. Only time valve ever did anything was when it got so bad that bots were spamming racism in chat, which got news media attention. Their solution was to disable chatting for all new players...  

This game will never be the same it was.

metacritic,GhostSupreme,team-fortress-2,"A once great game that has fallen from grace. How could it have fallen so far when cheaters were once the greatest threat, but now instead cheating bots have infested the game to such an extent? They have virtually ruined the game, and yet, Valve does nothing. 
The only time valve ever moved to do anything was when it got so bad that bots were spamming racism in chat, which got news media attention. (Their solution was to disable chatting for all new players…) 

Now something even worse than that may be brewing, and yet… nothing. I wonder how far it would have to go before Valve finally does something? If cheating means nothing to them, will it take actual crimes being committed in voice chat to move them to actually fix the problem? This is a sad, yet very real possibility that seems to slowly be coming true… sad to see such a legendary game either and die like this.",4,10

Short answer would be : too many giga sweats ( Triple stack) running wild in pubs and 6 Man Squads in Comps and Cheaters. Plus, Respawn and E.A doing nothing to fix the existing issues (server lags , expensive skins , non existing new mode). its 2024 and BR is not fresh anymore. 

they had a really good idea with Arenas but they had to shut it down 'cause they couldn't fix the cheating problems.

Non ranked gamemode is even worse as unrated you are forced into a full pred / washed pred lobby once your good enough, as all the normal players quit or are forced to play ranked to avoid that fkd q as at least there'd be some diamond/plat squad that got fkd and qd into that gold-pred lobby in ranked.

metacritic,Lythy,apex-legends,"Apex at one point was an amazing FPS battle Royale game with its unique movement mechanics and a wide range of weapons to choose from. But currently the game is possibly in its worse stage. The servers for Apex Legends are absolutely awful as every game you load into, your either disconnected or have packet loss which impacts gameplay heavily. Also the rank match making are terrible as for me (plat - diamond) I have to go up against top players (apex preds) and from that alone there’s a massive skill difference and for the random teammates I get in rank, their most of the time 2 rank below me or worse skill. 

This game is also very money hungry as they chance they battle pass system from in game currency to real life currency. And it’s also split into 2 battle passes per season so you’ll be spending 20 dollars for battle pass for both the half battle passes or 40 for the premium (if this makes sense). They are also very dry on content and always have collection events that only wants money and release recolour of old battle pass skins for about $250! 

Overall at this currently state, this game is one of the worse game on the internet.

metacritic,AaronXXI,apex-legends,"What was once a great game has become terrible in the past year, they made terrible battle pass changes where you cannot get the battle pass without paying irl currency and where you cannot earn credits from the previous battle pass to buy the next one, then they added ""milestone"" events which is just gambling which has essentially made crafting shards useless. The game has become a cash grab with barely any meaningful changes, events, or content for the amount of money they get, the cheating is terrible as well, the game is just boring lately all around. Not worth playing as of right now unless they get rid of the terrible monetisation and add real content.",0,10

If you're a new dev and you want to ruin a objectively good game based in an amazing universe you can just see what apex has done. EVERY. SINGLE.SEASON since 2021 this game has taken a nosedive into being a worse game. Where do i even begin, from the fact that the game has so many predatory events that in order to get the thing you want you have to spend a ton of money?
The fact that the balancing is thrown out of the window? The fact that pro players have to wait MONTHS before they get paid out? The fact that there are cheaters everywhere? The fact that the game has garbage sbmm putting people that haven't played in years with people that play daily and are a high rank. Players are pissed with all of these and the game devs  do nothing about those things but add more unwanted changes like  they will change the battle pass system that has been the same for YEARS just so they can squeeze every last dollar from their dying playerbase and the random new players that will stay for one or two seasons untill they even realize that the game has a whole pile of problems that the game ignores.

There are definitely people using strike packs and shooting with zero recoil and the lobbies are not equally matched at all.

Even on MnK, you're looking at months and months, if not over a year of practice, to really get it down.  Then you have cheating, which is another big issue in the game.  Their anticheat is old and outdated.  3rd, if your account that you spent thousands on gets hacked, you are SOL.  Support will not help you get your account back.  Their customer service is outsourced to India and all they do is give you the run around, and there is no other form of communication.

metacritic,TheManOfTheMask,apex-legends,"This game is one of the **** games of all time. The gameplay is average at best, and the limited action physics and animation make it as un-playable as it gets.While the game does have a voice acting part (which is the only part I enjoyed in the game), it doesn't help matters. To make matters worse, the dialogue is horrible. The ""movie"" cutscenes and character scenes have absolutely no character, or life to them at all, which is a major issue. However, it's the small things that make this game even worse. For instance, the ""action"" scenes use the typical quicktime event mechanic in place of gameplay. Again, like the cutscenes, the ""action"" scenes are terrible. The quicktime events are more like cinematic jump-cuts that don't let you react to the situations. This is just some minor flaws, but they just add to the fun-less experience.This is a very underwhelming game, and has only a few redeeming qualities. However, even though this game has so much room for improvement, there is nothing that makes this worth the price of the game. If you can ignore the terrible gameplay, and have a strange attraction to fighting 'totems', this game is an enjoyable time.

Die Skins sind ja cool. Schön und gut, okay. Aber das Game an sich besteht aus Hackern, nervige Kids, die versuchen ""cool"" zu sein, indem sie andere Mitspielern ärgern oder sogar beleidigen. Es finden Konzerte im Spiel statt? So wtf geht da ab. Aliens, irgendwelche andere Kreaturen... Minecfraft. Ich meine dann kann ich auch Minecraft spielen? Ich will mich nicht für alles beschweren, es gab ne Zeit, da mochte ich das Game fürchterlich. Aber die alten Maps fehlen und es gibt zuuu viele Season Wechsel. Na ja 2 von 10 mayfusion points",2,10

metacritic,ItzWinterYt,fortnite,"This is a review of the current state of Save The World(STW) . I am making this review because I am in enraged by the greed of Epic and their implicit attempts at encouraging people to stop playing STW. They are doing this by lowing the Vbucks that can be inquired by doing daily missions and lowering the total exp that can be gained through STW for the BR battle pass. Firstly, we used to be able to get around 70 vbucks a day from completing simple quests, however, after the recent December update it has been reduced to ZERO!!! In the last few days, there hasn’t been one Vbuck mission. They also changed the total exp cap: it used to be 5.6 battle-royale levels PER DAY! Now it has been severely reduced to 9 levels a WEEK. This is a 75+ percent decrease! They are trying to make players who only play STW to complete their battle pass QUIT. We will not accept this, we will fight for STW and the OG Fortnite.",0,10

Also, they're not making any interesting skins, as they just collab with some random musician (The game has gone so downhill, they're starting to collab with Ice Spice?

metacritic,DomTheDominator,fortnite,"From the well-known company Epic Games: Fortnite, the famous battle royale game which has taken the world by storm ever since its release back in 2017. It’s complex but easy to learn building system paired with its cartoony graphics really separate this game from the rest of the battle royale franchise. Initially upon creation, Fortnite was a zombie survival game with its own unique building mechanic, however was not entirely popular as it was focused on one specific genre of gaming. However then they switched it up to an 100 player battle royale game, where players are forced to fight until there is one remaining victor. No one expected it to switch up to the game it is now, with millions playing at a time and multiple going bankrupt in buying V-bucks, the virtual currency in the game, to buy the latest ‘Marvel Collaboration’ skin. At the time Fortnite switched to the battle royale genre, it had a large competitor, PUBG, another famous battle royale game, had released a few months ago, and was really popular amongst players. However, what set Fortnite apart from other battle royale games including PUBG was its goofy cartoon graphics and its unique fun-to-learn building mechanic taken from it’s original game, nowadays known to players as ‘Save The World’. One of the main things about Fortnite is that every game is unique in its own way, no fights will be the same, loot is mostly randomised, and you’ll never know whether you will find a friend who will end up giving you the win or whether you will get blasted to pieces within seconds of playing the game. Also as of last December, Fortnite have added a Lego mode, a Music mode, and a racing mode, which you could say is adding multiple games into one single game. In other words, it takes a while to get bored of this game. Despite its skill-based matchmaking system, Fortnite does seem to have an issue where players who have played the game for 2 weeks or so get put into the same match as no-life sweats who haven’t seen the light of day in years, I myself have spent around £2000 on new headsets after tearing them apart, imagining the headset as the body of the player who just murdered me and grinning ear to ear as I tear them apart, before realising I’ve done it again... Additionally, the building mechanic of the game isn’t too difficult to learn, but when you do learn it you realise that people keep getting better at it day after day, which is where most people quit after realising to become within the top players they are gonna have to keep playing for years on end whilst trying to improve at a faster than average rate. Fortnite Battle Royale itself isn’t entirely moddable, however they have a ‘creative’ mode which lets you create your own maps for you and others to play, which after the addition of unreal engine 5 in 2023, let’s you create more than games involving shooting and fighting, for example people create horror games, tycoons. As much as this feature is great, its turned Fortnite creative more into the disgrace ‘****’, in which players are posting over colourful thumbnails and clickbait for games desgined for 5 year olds. While Fortnite is advertised as a free game, that is only to deceive you. After a maximum of 2 months, you will begin to feel left out after most around you have new skins/ the new battle pass which will encourage you to buy your own first skin. However, after that you will get hooked into buying new flashy skins and/or collaboration skins with other games, movies etc until you are in crippling debt due to this game. Although Fortnite began with its own iconic and creative music, indicated in emotes (dances) and launching the game, it has now collaborated with musicians and companies allowing it to have its own ‘Jam Tracks’ and ‘Icon Emotes’, which means you can listen to your favourite songs in game. However, now you barely see original music made by the game as everything is just a copy paste from tiktok really. Although Fortnite is a mainly stable game, it does see its fair share of bugs and exploits, usually after the addition of new items and weapons to the game. However, usually these end up being fun glitches which the community enjoys and aren’t too game breaking. Fortnite actually does very well in terms of their servers, usually any sort of lag is due to personal wifi issues etc. Whilst Fortnite does let you play with multiple players at a time, until recently there hasn’t been that much moderation over voice chats, and like any game players can get mad and say slurs and can be homophobic, racist, etc so isn’t neccesarily safe. Overall, I would give Fortnite a solid 2/10, I feel like the game is very enjoyable for many and has nice graphics and music to accompany it. However, I feel like it is known better for its first chapter, where everything and everyone was new so the game felt a lot more fun for everyone.",2,10

metacritic,Slayercide,fortnite,"Overhyped but also over hated, it's one of the few battle royals that I can have fun in, thechange in maps, gameplay mechanics and new modes makes it repayable, as mixed as I feel about how microtransactions it seems to do grind, and skins better than most as you aren't forced to buy bundles, there aren't any loot boxes and depending on how often you play you can probably get through the battlepass in maybe a couple weeks or less, or at least i have a couple times, they definitely overdo collabs, there have been cool ones that can add some intersting map changes or gameplay, like storm troopers being on the map during starters events but that's it, also recently the slight censoring of skins, emotes or removal of items due to nontroversies is unnecessary",7,10

metacritic,RobbieRaymond69,fortnite,"Fortnite is kind of a hard game to give a review for since the game is constantly changing and, especially with how nowadays they swap in and out more and more game-changing elements, you could really like one season but not be a big fan of another. However, I do find that the game as a whole tends to be quite enjoyable. It is definitely a meme at this point in regards to all the crossovers that the game has done, but I think that aspect does give the game a certain level of charm. I should note that I am a huge fan of Zero Build but am not a fan whatsoever of Build mode. I feel like the Build mode is needlessly complicated and just **** the fun out of the game, even if in concept it sounds like a neat idea. I had tried this game before Zero Build and just could not get into it when it was Build only. However, after the introduction of Zero Build, taking away the one major crutch of the game (which ironically, in its early days, is what had set it apart from other Battle Royales) massively improved the experience. The combat is satisfying and the game as a whole controls very well. Playing solo is a fun test of your combat skills while playing duos/trios/squads with friends is just a blast of a time, having tense moments during the combat alongside fun moments where you take the downtime between combat to do funny emotes while you search for loot. Also you do have some of the new modes they introduced at the beginning of Chapter 5. Lego Fortnite is basically Minecraft; while I would prefer to play Minecraft, Lego Fortnite does offer a lot more convenience since it is way easier to set up a server and play online multiplayer than Minecraft. The Rocket Racing mode is a fun distraction every now and then, but nothing too special. Festival Mode basically plays like Guitar Hero and this is the mode I find myself playing the most of the new additions. I was personally never good with the GH guitar controller, so being able to play this sort of game on a normal controller is nice, and the way they set up the controls is very intuitive. If you happen to have a GH controller, there is even an option to hook it up and use it on this mode. I do feel like the song selection is a bit lacking for the most part, but there are certainly some bangers to pick from in the lineup. One last thing to note is that there are even creator-made levels that is very reminiscent of **** except I would argue it is, generally speaking, a lot more polished than **** is. There are all sorts of maps people have made, from obstacles courses to Prop Hunts to Team Deathmatch maps, and so on. Some of these are actually really fun and a nice distraction I find myself going to every now and then. Overall, I would recommend at least playing Zero Build Fortnite if you want to have a fun, silly shooter game to play with your friends.",8,10

metacritic,Hendrik4K,fortnite,"Fortnite: Ein Spiel, das seine Seele verloren hatEs ist traurig, wie sehr Fortnite sich verändert hat. Was einst ein Spiel war, das für Spielspaß, Kreativität und Fairness stand, ist heute nichts weiter als eine riesige Geldmaschine. Es wird immer offensichtlicher, dass das gesamte Game-Design nur noch darauf ausgelegt ist, den Spielern das Geld aus der Tasche zu ziehen. Statt spannender neuer Inhalte konzentrieren sich die Updates fast ausschließlich auf den Itemshop, der selbst längst seinen Reiz verloren **** Battle Pass, der früher ein echtes Highlight war, ist nur noch eine leere Hülle. Die meisten Belohnungen, die man dort freischaltet, werden zu 80% nie genutzt. Es wirkt, als würden die Entwickler kaum noch Rücksicht auf die Community nehmen. Features, die den Spielern wirklich Spaß gemacht haben, werden einfach entfernt, ohne Erklärung oder Ersatz. Fortnite hat die Magie, die es einst so besonders gemacht hat, schon vor langer Zeit verloren, und jetzt ist auch für mich der Punkt erreicht, an dem ich aufgeben muss.Besonders frustrierend ist das Verhalten in den Multiplayer-Modi wie Duos, Trios oder Squads. Es kommt viel zu oft vor, dass man Spieler im Team hat, die überhaupt nicht kommunizieren, obwohl das in solchen Modi essentiell ist. Wenn die Leute dann doch mal reden, verlassen sie das Spiel einfach, sobald sie sterben. Dafür gibt es keinerlei Strafe – sie können sofort weiterzocken, als wäre nichts passiert. Das ist unfair gegenüber den restlichen Teammitgliedern, die dann im Stich gelassen werden. Andere Spiele setzen hier klare Regeln und bestrafen das vorzeitige Verlassen einer Runde mit einem Timeout. Doch Fortnite tut nichts, um die Spieler zu unterstützen, die wirklich als Team spielen **** weiteres großes Problem sind die Hacker. Epic Games unternimmt kaum etwas, um gegen sie vorzugehen. Wenn man ernsthaft um Echtgeld spielt, wird man nur frustriert von den ständigen Cheatern, gegen die nichts unternommen wird. Das Spiel ist inzwischen ungenießbar.Insgesamt hat sich Fortnite in ein Spiel verwandelt, das nur noch darauf abzielt, Spielzeit und Geld zu maximieren, ohne den Spielspaß im Auge zu behalten. Wer genauer hinsieht, merkt schnell: Dieses Spiel hat seine Seele verloren und ist heute nicht mehr das, was es einmal war.",3,10

They've also ruined things that were previously great, such as the scar being peoples favourite weapons, or making events that barely even last long enough for the unreasonable amount of time people put into waiting for it.

Its starting to get really hard to get exited for a new season now. and and minor nitpick. the fact they got rid of battle mode or just the meens to explore the map solo was really dum. some of these new POI's look great but i dont have time to look at them as i'm either taking storm damage or there's players in that POI.

metacritic,satvikag,fortnite,"Fortnite's appeal lies in its dynamic blend of shooting mechanics and unique building features, allowing players to construct defenses and vantage points on the fly, adding a layer of strategy to the frenetic battles. The game's constant updates and events keep the experience fresh, ensuring there's always something new to discover. However, the proliferation of microtransactions, particularly for cosmetic items, can feel exploitative and detract from the immersion. Additionally, the skill gap between seasoned players and newcomers can be daunting, potentially discouraging new entrants. Nevertheless, Fortnite's vibrant art style, tight controls, and frequent collaborations with pop culture icons make it an engaging and often exhilarating multiplayer experience. For those willing to overlook its monetization model and steep learning curve, Fortnite offers a captivating and ever-evolving virtual arena where every match is an opportunity for triumph or defeat.",7,10

metacritic,Makoprima,fortnite,"This specifically is a review for Fortnite: Save the World's PC release.

I'm one of those people who have been around since 2017, and bought the game with a founder's package. I don't regret it at all. I've burned hundreds of hours on the PvE experience Save the World brings. Essentially, picture your favorite third person shooter with a tower defense. Sounds awesome, right?

Anyway, that concept was enough to get me hooked, but the sheer variety in hero and weapon builds, as well as the progression being simple but satisfying has kept me coming back.

As for the downsides, STW is a ""dead"" game that's very much neglected by its devs and is very frequently ridden by gameplay hindering bugs. Also, 90% of the random players you run into will be griefers, or just people who **** at the game so bad you might as well not have on your team. That hampers things quite a bit. But regardless, the aspects I love about this game have not been properly replicated by any PvE game on the market.

And in a market where a lot of mediocre games are $70, I think spending $18.50 to be able to play Save the World (As well as getting some vbucks and a skin to go with it) is a steal in today's day and age. Even without founders, I wouldn't blink to buy that package if you enjoy these kinds of PvE experiences.",10,10

metacritic,DragonulX,playerunknowns-battlegrounds,"I have played so many good and less good games lately that I forgot to leave a review for this game, which consumed over 370 hours of my life just on Steam. On the Mobile version, I invested thousands of hours, and in PUBG Lite, another few hundred, only to later regret the time spent, especially in Lite, which has been erased from existence despite its huge potential. Today, I want to clearly explain why this game is no longer worth **** the beginning, PUBG on Steam was flawless. There were minor bugs related to textures and mapping if you had less than 12GB RAM, but nothing major. There was a bug where you could fly with the car using explosions, or fall under the map if you exited the vehicle at just the right speed. However, the biggest issue was the number of cheaters. I’m not talking about simple wallhacks or recoil stability, but hackers who could fly like in Counter-Strike with noclip, had infinite health, and stayed under the map to win automatically. These cheaters were eventually banned, but the damage to the game was already **** game’s initial optimization was fantastic. You could run it at 60 FPS even on an entry-level PC with DDR3 RAM. The graphics were realistic and immersive. Everything changed drastically in the summer of 2020. Suddenly, over-the-top, colorful skins appeared at ridiculously high prices (e.g., a simple green, white, and black Groza skin for $10). But the real problem was the Fortnite-style outfits, which completely ruined the serious atmosphere: pink popcorn backpacks, cat-ear helmets, and even stripper outfits from a K-pop collaboration. This change shifted the game’s tone from a military-style battle royale to something almost cartoonish, alienating many long-time players.Then came the pointless updates that destroyed the game’s performance. The map-picking system eliminated variety, and optimization became a disaster. Today, unless you have at least a GTX 1070 or RX 580, the game is nearly unplayable at decent settings. On top of that, the ranking system became a joke. Previously, you could rank up solo, but now you must play in squads of four, eliminating individual progress entirely. This change made the game less accessible for solo players and casual gamers who wanted a more independent experience.Another major downfall was when PUBG became Free-to-Play. Those who paid for the game received no real compensation, and the ""Plus+"" system was a joke. Over time, the player count dropped drastically, and bots replaced real players. These bots are so poorly programmed that they sometimes spend 10 minutes failing to kill each other, waiting for a player to show up and finish them off. It’s frustrating to loot a building only to hear two bots in a ridiculous standoff nearby, missing every shot and making the game feel **** remaining players are either cheaters or hardcore level 300+ veterans who obliterate any newcomer. There is no proper matchmaking system, making the experience frustrating for new players. You'll constantly die to cheaters who somehow know your exact location, throw perfectly timed grenades, or kill you instantly with impossible headshots. This imbalance makes it impossible for new players to enjoy the game without being endlessly farmed by veterans and cheaters **** make things worse, new updates keep adding unnecessary mechanics that stray even further from PUBG’s original vision. Weapons are constantly rebalanced in unpredictable ways, ruining established meta strategies. The UI has become cluttered with pop-ups, advertisements for overpriced skins, and event notifications that no one asked for. Instead of fixing major gameplay issues, the developers seem focused on monetization, squeezing every last penny from the remaining player **** game has also lost its strategic appeal. PUBG was once about positioning, survival instincts, and tactical gunplay. Now, it's all about flashy cosmetics, pay-to-win mechanics, and broken matchmaking. Even competitive players have been affected by this downfall, with tournaments losing credibility due to frequent hacking scandals and inconsistent rule enforcement. The integrity of PUBG as a competitive shooter has crumbled, leaving little reason for serious gamers to invest time in it.Conclusion? PUBG started strong but has now collapsed. Poor optimization, absurd monetization, a terrible matchmaking system, and an infestation of cheaters make it unplayable for serious gamers. The only ones left are those clinging to nostalgia or competing in championships. If you’re a new player, prepare for a frustrating and unbalanced **** its peak, PUBG was the king of battle royale games. It offered intense gameplay, rewarding combat mechanics, and a true sense of survival. But today, all of that has been replaced with cheap skins, laggy servers, and a community that’s either toxic, cheating, or both. Unless drastic changes are made, PUBG will continue its downward spiral into irrelevance.",1,10

metacritic,caralarmexpert,playerunknowns-battlegrounds,"I'll start with optimization, or rather the lack thereof. For 7 years, this game has been stagnating in terms of optimization. Each patch adds only paid skins and edits to the display of these skins (various visual bugs when putting on different skins). Each patch brings bugs to the game lobby, random ping increases and disconnects from the server (and this is a problem exclusively with cheap servers and not a problem on the part of the player). New maps are a separate type of masochism, if you take Sanok. This map lags like hell. Everyone's favorite cheaters. After the game switched to FTP, it became a breeding ground for cheaters. On average, 70k accounts are banned per week. But I will tell you that Crafton cooperates with software developers, because old accounts with a large number of donation skins can easily use a hack wall aka ESP, scripts for shooting without recoil, and especially impudent ones and aimbot. Stupid cheaters with fresh accounts get banned for a week, and often they are banned for a couple of **** Chinese are a separate type of subhumans, the percentage of cheaters is about 70%. They occupied the CIS servers and reports do not work in most cases.There is no balance in the game at all. Recently, Crafton has merged regions to find games faster, but this is all a lie. In fact, they decided to save on servers and simply merge neighboring regions and not pay for servers and their maintenance. Everyone already knows the situation with the SA region)) ping 150 and the inability to play. Fortunately, the resonance and the petition for 60k signatures about the return of the SA servers bore fruit and the developers **** their pants and returned the servers. The balance in the squad search works against you as much as possible. As a player of rank 1 bronze, 95% of the time I come across noobs with new accounts or rank 2 or 3 with complete noobs who don't understand where they are being shot at from. The enemy team will interfere with you with rank 5 masters who can see everyone through mountains, walls and kilometers of distance. I think it's not worth talking about the results of such matches. As a result, I do not recommend anyone to play this garbage sharpened for donation skins and a huge number of cheaters until the developers take up the creation of an anti-cheat.",0,10

metacritic,LT_Gruber,playerunknowns-battlegrounds,"Kind of boring and empty Battle Royale game, in my opinion.

PUBG was the first Battle Royale game I played, when the genre was still new for me. I liked its style of playing, with the arena that got smaller over time, finding weapons to defend yourself against other players and the teamwork when playing with friends. 

My fun however, was short-lived with this game. This was mainly because I thought it looks and feels a little empty. I played many times with friends, and even then, I got this feeling. Normally when I play any game with friends, this is not the case, so for me, I knew that this was not a game that I would play for many years.

The graphics in PUBG are a little boring. I did not expect shiny next generation visuals or something, but everything is almost the same color, green grasslands with a orange sky. It looks kind of realistic, like everyday life, but the whole atmosphere just felt hollow. 

The sound effects from weapons are great and get close to realism.

The controls and movement are a little stiff and felt a little slow. This is mainly because of the big world you are walking in, making a mile really feel like a mile. 

My problem, as always, with this kind of games, is that I am just not skilled enough. I try very hard to stay alive and kill another player, but they are always faster than me. Well, in a game like Counter Strike for example, this is fine, I respawn immediately and can try again and might get some kills and streaks afterwards. But with games like PUBG, you walk around, collect stuff, do not see a living soul in sight and then *Bam*, dead. For me, the game is over and I need to find another server to play on. 

Then you got the fact that this game felt like Battlefield 2, my arch nemesis when talking online shooters. Massive open, empty world, walk for miles and miles, and then get shot. It was some sort of Vietnam flashback for me and I immediately disliked the game by the second.

The biggest problem, that has been patched if I am not mistaken, was that players could turn down their graphics to potato mode, in which grass and foliage disappeared. This gave them a huge advantage over players that were hiding in the grass to avoid being killed. For me, this almost killed all the fun I had with the game at the time. 

In the end, PUBG was fun for a couple of hours, and I had some joy with it, but with the knowledge of today, I prefer Apex Legends over this one **** me personally, I would not recommend this game.",6,10

metacritic,MemoryAlex,playerunknowns-battlegrounds,"Para ser sincero me siento decepcionado.. 
PUBG en su momento me llego a parecer el mejor Battle Royale porque gráficamente es muy bonito, muy realista y no solo en como luce, sino también en su jugabilidad haciendo mucho hincapié en el retroceso de las armas, el sigilo y muchos otros puntos que te hacen sentir que si realmente llegaras a estar en un enfrentamiento de la vida real... pues esta experiencia seria la mas acertada. 
Sin embargo, no me han gustado para nada sus ultimas decisiones, en un principio cuando el juego paso al formato Free To Play me pareció una gran idea, pero llego con el inconveniente de que para poder jugar Rankeds tenias que pagar el PLUS, cosa que el 90% de los que han llegado desde que cambio su formato de pago no han hecho y eso a provocado que el modo Competitivo del PUBG actualmente este mas que muerto!, si te quedas unos 10 o 15 minutos buscando partida nunca encontraras. 
El rendimiento en PC lo eh sentido como otro gran problema ya que a pesar de contar una PC Gamer el juego me da tirones o me empieza a sobrecalentar el PC con tan solo 1 hora jugando!.

Retomando el tema de las decisiones, no me a gustado el contenido que han metido, ya que, se siente mas como si PUBG estuviera realizando intentos desesperados por competir contra los otros del genero en lugar de ser original... haciendo colaboraciones con juegos como Street Fighter pero donde solo meten algunas Skins y Bailes a un precio exagerado de g-coins que suelen conseguirse con dinero real!. 
Por ultimo la gota que derramo el baso y me hizo dejar este titulo fue su traspaso a la tienda de Epic Games... si bien el titulo continua disponible en Steam y es donde mas jugadores tiene, me parece algo muy hipócrita y desesperado tomando en cuenta que en 2018 hasta demandaron a Fortnite por plagio... todo esto me hace sentir que PUBG ya no tiene dignidad, originalidad...

Что есть на 23 год:
- Баги, их все еще достаточно много, но с теми что я видел у других на релизе - не втречался.
- Отсутствие баланса, игра не любит новичков и кидает всех в одну мясорубку, будь то чел играющий с преальфа версии или чел который получил игру только что за бесплатно.
- Невозможно выбрать карту как раньше, как я понял онлайн на некоторых картах проседал и им ""пришлось"" убрать маппул из игры заменив его рандомом, но рандом это что то... из 10 игр вы 4 будете играть на Мирамаре, 5 на Саноке и 1 на Викенди, на Эрангеле вам дадут поиграть по праздникам.
- Низкий онлайн, игра била рекорды онлайна но сейчас приходится иногда по 8 мин. в лобби торчать в ожидании игры.

Из плюсов
- оптимизация, не знаю у кого как, у меня средний ПК который вполне хорошо тянет игру на средне-высоких настройках.
- внутриигровые события, проходят довольно часто, можно получить разные плюшки выполняя не сложные задания.

metacritic,Lukrejshyn,playerunknowns-battlegrounds,"In my opinion the worst of the biggest BRs on the market. Comparing it to Fortnite, Apex and Warzone PUBG  simply dies on the vine.

The first issue you'll run into is the optimization. It hasn't improved much since the launch of the game. It's horrible although the game looks like stitched up Unity assets. Thank god this game is free now and not like it used to be.

My second point is the gameplay. The recoil feels terrible and FP camera looks quite clunky when compared to TP point of view. The movement is really strange. Sometimes it feels like you're sliding on the floor and sometimes your character can barely move. While the unforgiving aspect of the game can be really adrenaline pumping in the moments where there's nothing happening the game can feel like a walking simulator. Yes that aspect also extends to other BR games but in PUBG because of the size of the maps it really shows. Along with it's unforgiving nature it creates really unfun situations in which you're often killed before you even have a time to react.

Along with it comes lots of controversies the game and dev team had through it's lifespan like for example releasing an unfinished and broken port **** for consoles when the game itself hasn't been fully finished.

Overall the PUBG in the bigger scale may not seem that bad but when compared to it's competition it has nothing to offer apart from unforgiving gameplay and semi-realistic weapon systems. If you really want to play a battle royale you've got a ton of better, free and more fleshed out options.",3,10

metacritic,HaloBlues,animal-crossing-new-horizons,"The graphics are charming and genuinely pretty in places such as the sky/weather and the textures and designs of most of the villagers. It's easy to forget how good they are, but looking back at older games makes it clear that New Horizons is a massive graphical upgrade. Characters are appropriately adorable-looking, but completely devoid of personality. Villagers are the entire point of this franchise, as well as the bonds you form with yours, and yet in this game they've been reduced to window-dressing for your customised island who recite the same dozen generic lines identical to every other villager of the same type. A lot of my 'dream villagers' are of the same few types, and so I can be hitting nothing but repeated dialogues within literal minutes of opening the game. It's soulless. The gameplay is... fine. There are some good QoL improvements, such as the way clothes shopping now works at the Able Sisters and terraforming the land, but there are just... so many things that were a given in older games that have been cut out or have regressed in this one. The crafting system is awful and repetitive, DIY recipes are time-consuming to get and even then mostly just carbon copies of ones you already have, even golden tools (extremely difficult to construct) are now breakable, and shops have far fewer or no upgrades to uncover, just to name a few. You can have up to eight players on an island over online multiplayer, or up to four using local co-op. It's pretty much what you'd expect from Animal Crossing - you can run around together and visit each other's villagers (so you can experience their generic dialogue, too!) but aside from activities you can come up with and design yourself there's nothing to really do together. Overall, this game just... depresses me in a lot of ways. It's stripped back, sanitised, minimalised and ""streamlined"" in that corporate, modern game kind of way, where all the charm and heart is being lost in order to fit flashy new features to distract from all the ones that have been made worse. Sure, it was a nice refuge over lockdown, but it genuinely kind of angers me that that means this game is going down as a huge best-seller success when it's just... empty. It has the same kind of issue as Sims 4, to my mind, and the fact that so many players picked New Horizons up as their first Animal Crossing game means they don't even know what they're missing. I'll be returning to Wild World and perhaps even New Leaf, because playing this just reminds me I miss the old villagers.",5,10

The seasonal events and special updates keep it fresh and exciting, making you want to come back and see what’s **** music and sound effects are so soothing and really add to the vibe of the game. And don’t even get me started on the villagers—they have so much personality and make the game feel alive. You get attached to them, and when they leave, it’s like saying goodbye to a friend. And then there’s Tom Nook, the capitalistic king of the island who somehow manages to make you feel like you’re the one in charge while he’s pulling all the strings behind the scenes. The man’s a genius when it comes to selling you overpriced homes and upgrades, but you can’t help but love him for it.

I don't even like cozy farm games anymore, but this game is soooo goood!
It's cute and pollished. It has a sense of addictiveness that me and many other people enjoy. The community while filled with complaining attitudes is one of the most special elements of this game.
I will say that I understand the critisism that this game was a letdown. We were promised 2-3 years of updates, and all we got was around 1 and a half. I will say that the people saying that have put thousands of hours into the game already so it's a bit of a moot point.

This game has many plus's tho-
It's seriously unbeleivaby cute, everything from the animals, to the objects, character creators are so adorable. The gameplay is fun especially when you don't time travel. You get a sense of accomplishment which is funny because all you did was sit at home playing Animal Crossing (This part was fun especially in the 2020 lockdown) This game while clearly not being even remotly realistic is a great social sim. The villagers are charming and fun to talk to, you can build them objects and fufill requests, give them gifts etc. The game is forever playable and never ending.

metacritic,RestlessWater,animal-crossing-new-horizons,"I thought this game was okay. Some things in the game are cool but it is a game that loves to waste the players time with everything that you do, and because of that, I hate it so much.

The Good
The graphics are very good and cute.
You can move most of the objects that you place.
You can customize your house and island.

The Bad
There’s no story. You just have to talk to right people to make your island better. And, even when I was putting a lot of cool expensive things around the island, Isabelle still gave it a 1 star, saying that I needed to improve it.

The game is so damn grindy. Omg. The amount of time that it takes to accumulate enough money to pay off each debt keeps increasing to a stupid degree. How can adding another room be more expensive than the last extra room?

Dialogue takes forever to complete, even when you are pressing it to make it go faster. It still takes too long!You can’t buy a ton of a single item at once. 

You can only buy an item one at a time. It’s crazy! I expected more from Nintendo. You can however buy seeds in bulk of 5 at the shop.

Everything wastes your time. Talking to the museum owl, he says the same thing every time and it’s annoying. All his complaining and bulls##t too.

Crafting items ****. When crafting you have to manually put the specific ingredients in your bag to craft an item. Items cannot be used from your storage. 

Tools that you make break fast. It’s beyond stupid how that works for your high-end tools.

All the characters seem to talk the same. Some may have their own little quirks like Cherry saying “what what” at the end of sentences.

Birds who appear on the beach all make you do the same fetch every time! Same with the ghost!

The scallop guy in the ocean is annoying when he pops up and wants to spread his useless thoughts.

You have to hold the “B” button then move the analog all the way to make your character run. Just make the damn character run! What else is that button used for?

Going to another island when using a ticket makes the switch run hotter and you can hear it and feel it. Like, how can a small island with one villager stress the switch?

There’s no way to know what items you already own. I had no idea what clothes or stuff I bought from the nook store. So I stopped caring and just wore one thing. No point in collecting a ton of clothes or items that I’ll never know that I have dupes of, especially when it doesn’t matter and even more so when there is only so much space in the storage. Hanging clothes on the walls is dumb.

There’s no way to change controls, keybindings, or settings. I wanted to play with the dpad. Scared of drift.

People want and can leave the island. Problem is, you need resources that you can only get once per day, and then you have to use that to buy a ticket to then fly to get people. Why make it a pain in the a#$ to have some attempt to beat this game?

Everything in this game is so expensive.

An achievement wants you to play every day for a year.

Some items take too long or are too hard to get.

Conclusion
I gave the game 85 hours of my life, when I knew that playing my other games, like mario wonder or kingdom hearts, was way more fun. Bottomline, the game doesn’t respect your time.",1,10

metacritic,KajQrd,animal-crossing-new-horizons,"It's a time sink, but sadly for all the wrong reasons. I have 75 hours so far in the game. But a LOT of it is basically fast clicking to repeat mundane tasks like buying bell vouchers, crafting multiples of the same thing etc. Instead of doing the logical thing and having an option to purchase or craft multiples by a simple box asking how many it's five different clicks per item purchased, several clicks per item crafted etc. How is this in any way acceptable? Luckily I am the only person using my switch. But the limit to one island per console is also a MAJOR point of pure idiocy. And no cloud save means if the console goes so does your island (yes, this has happened to me). It does have some things going for it. The graphics are cute, the social aspect is fine (though I do think **** Valley does it better) but it is hard to respect a game that clearly doesn't respect your time.",4,10

metacritic,Boysle,animal-crossing-new-horizons,"Disappointing.
First of all, I am a fan of the series. New Leaf was one of my favorite 3DS games. I enjoyed New Horizons for some time so my score is not lower than 5.
What made me keep playing New Horizons was the possibility of building my ultimate dream world. At first, it started great, hour by hour, slowly improving my island. After a hundred hours, though, I started to lose interest, and looking back, all I saw were unfinished dreams and bitter feelings of regret for losing all these hours.
So, what happened? To start and invest time in these games, you have to build trust in the game itself about what the end game will bring. However, the game came out unfinished so the trust shifted from the game itself to the developers. Ultimately, the developers failed to deliver quality updates and it made everything fall to the ground.
My last complaint is about the villager's personalities. They are always so agreeable and getting the same line from two different villagers with the same personality breaks the immersion.",5,10
metacritic,Tipt03,animal-crossing-new-horizons,"Gotta be honest, I find this game really boring. The only improvements are the amount of customization options and different skintones (because animal crossing was way behind in that aspect). Other than that, this is a step down from New Leaf. The terraforming, which was the most advertised feature, takes forever to get to. New Leaf lets you jump into the fun immediately, but here you have to wait soo long until the interesting part. I actually didn't get to the terraforming because I put the game down a year ago and haven't checked on it since. I've never lost interest in a game so quickly. Another thing that bothers me is how washed down and boring the villagers (or islanders) are now. I know there were people who didn't like how some villagers were mean or sassy in older games, but you can't deny that it added spice and made them feel like real neighbors (because not everybody will instantly love you upon first meeting in real life, obviously). But now all the villagers have the same cookie-cutter niceness, making them lose what made them distict. Even villagers with snooty and grouchy personality types lack the edge they used to have. New Horizons was only critically acclaimed because it released during the pandemic when everyone was dying of boredom. If it was released before or a year after the pandemic, I'd imagine people would've been much more critical of it. I think they tried too hard to be ""cozy"" and ""chill"" that it backfired and made the game boring and bland.",4,10
metacritic,froomie01,animal-crossing-new-horizons,Animal crossing new horizons is a great looking game but lacks the charm and content the series is know for and feels to short.

I’ve never played the original tabletop RPG and had zero background knowledge of the Cyberpunk world. I felt the game didn’t provide enough introduction or context to ease new players into it. The story seemed confusing, and after about 10 hours, I just wasn’t really invested.

- Красивая графика.
- Огромное разнообразие боевых механик.

Today the gameplay is smoothed and with no doubt was the best experience I had playing a video game.",10,10
metacritic,Fngdog,cyberpunk-2077,"As I went through this game once again, I suddenly realized how it hooked me for such a long time. Literally everything in this game is about immersing yourself in the world and the story of the characters. 
First of all, it contributes to the first-person view, thanks to which each moment of the game is perceived as part of the story, the cut scenes are also in the first person, and that makes each one real for the player's character. Also, unlike many other games, the main quest of the game is not a victory over the world evil, bandits or corporations, but primarily the personal story of the main character. The development of the game world is simply amazing, as not only locations, characters, but also their entire history and environment were created: From citywide advertising to local and universe-unique slang, which is also featured in songs you can hear on the radio. 
Some may think that the city is empty and lifeless, but nevertheless, I think it perfectly performs its function: it is a location for the history and nothing more. If Cyberpunk is perceived not as another GTA clone just taking place in 2077, but as a game with a unique and deep history, it will begin to unfold much better. Of course, even from a familiar point of view, I enjoyed playing the game, but nevertheless, I think that a lot of people did not see what it can show and tell.
I hope at least one person reads my review and can take a new look at the game. For me, Cyberpunk is first and foremost about the thoughtful and integral story of the character, about his being in the world of the game. Thank you to the developers for the opportunity to immerse yourself in a unique world and a fascinating story, I hope the next part will not lose the qualities for which I loved this game. I honestly think Cyberpunk is the absolute best game in the industry at the moment, and I'm not sure if anyone can change that anytime soon. I'm glad I'm young enough not to worry about not having time to see the next part because of death from old age)

I have a good PC (SSD, 4060 Ti GPU, etc.) so it's not a specs problem.

Lo bueno:
- A nivel grafico creo que solo Red Dead Redemption 2 puede ser punto de comparación. Increíble.
- Night City es la ciudad original mas hermosa creada en un mundo abierto. Y competencia directa de grandes ciudades de referencia como las presentadas en Assassin's Creed que aunque no compiten gráficamente no son referente por la sensación que transmitían al recorrer sus calles.
- La historia es muy buena, con varios finales y buena narrativa.- Para los amantes de la ciencia ficción es lo que se busca.- El sistema de disparos es genial.
- La música es futurista, incluso en las clásicas.

Lo malo:
- Jugándolo un año después y con todos los parches que han salido aun se consiguen varios bugs que son molestos.
- La progresión de las misiones secundarias no es tan lograda, con las típicas llamadas de ir de aquí para allá, róbate esto o mata a aquel personaje.
- No sientes una verdadera progresión de personaje, se siente mucho a ACO en este aspecto. Antiguo si se quiere.- Los combates cuerpo a cuerpo no están muy bien logrados.",8,10
metacritic,pimentayy,cyberpunk-2077,"Cyberpunk 2077 is one of the best RPG experiences i've ever had in my life.

I confess, i was very reticent about playing this, because of the rough launch and the disappointment that many players had over the game.

But now that i played it, i can say for sure that Cyberpunk 2077 is one of the best RPG's ever made.

CD Projekt Red manage somehow to raise the game from the state that it was, and fix it entirely, giving the players the best experience possible.

The story is amazing. Not only the main part of it, but all the side quests and side stuff too. All the parts of the narrative are very well written and well structured.

The main story however is the highest point of the game, pairing with the character development that really meant a lot to me. I can't say that there is one character that's not interesting or not appealing. All the people that cross with V are important in some way, for his progress and development throughout the course of the game.

The quest design is peak entertainment. Every single main quest is very unique, with his own very original style. I can remember several quests and moments that blew my mind and left me ""breathtaked"" during my playthrough.

The side stuff is very appealing too, because it rewards you as the player to do them. All the gigs, the side job's and so on. It is in fact rewarding for the player to ""lose time"" with them. On top of that, there are so many different ""job's"" inside these side quests, that it doesn't get repetitive.

Talking about the world of Cyberpunk, Night City is just breathtaking. The city feels very alive because of the density of crowd on the streets, the different factions in the different districts, and many other elements that make you feel like you're really there, with V, exploring the city and all it's corners.

The gameplay, to finish this mini review, is top notch. The gunplay is very enjoyable with each gun feeling very unique and fun to play with. The exploration feels really different from anything else, because of all the interiors and buildings. The hacking system is just amazing, much better than other games that are entirely focused on it, with many possibilities do to whatever you want, and approach every situation as you please.",10,10
metacritic,Valid_narwhal77,cyberpunk-2077,At first i was hesitant to purchase this game but after playing just the first few missions I was blown away.

metacritic,Serhii2001,cyberpunk-2077,"Cyberpunk 2077 is my favorite game of all time.

Six months ago, I completed both the base game and the Phantom Liberty expansion, earning the Platinum trophy, and I loved every second of it. Now, I find myself itching to dive back into the chaotic, neon-lit streets of Night City once again. I can’t wait for the sequel!

The story struck a deep chord with me - it hasn’t let go even to this day. Lines from the game still echo in my mind, and I’ve grown attached to so many characters, all of whom are written and developed brilliantly. Even after 180 hours of gameplay, the combat never got old, and there are still countless ways to approach missions, develop my character, and experience the game differently.

Lately, a lot of games feel soulless, failing to evoke any real emotions. But Cyberpunk 2077? It has heart. It has depth. And that’s why I cherish it so much.

I know the game had a rough launch, plagued by technical issues, crashes, and an almost unplayable state on PlayStation. But I have immense respect for the developers for not abandoning it. Instead, they kept refining and improving it, turning it into something truly spectacular—and delivering an incredible expansion on top of that.

V is great (I played with male V) but Johnny Silverhand is just one of the, if not the most, greatest video games characters of all times.

Simply the best romance in video games history, extremely relevant to V's arc, the plot in general and author of the best ending possible.Soundtrack is amazing.

metacritic,S0lnyx,cyberpunk-2077,"A gorgeous game with a well-developed universe that really draws you in. Cyberpunk is not just a game about killing and going on missions, it is a game about the importance of choice, about building relationships with other characters and thereby creating your own history of not just becoming legend of Night City, and also developing V's story and his future, lifepath. It is an honor for me that I was able to allow myself to touch such a masterpiece from an equally wonderful studio with an amazing game director.

2 - Problemas que encontrei durante minha jogatina: tenho 150h no game e o jogo crashou diversas vezes, umas 5 no mínimo, tem alguns bugs também de veículos e NPCs entrando no chão, mas o jogo é tão divertido que não chegou a me incomodar sinceramente, mas os bugs estão lá mesmo que sejam poucos, são notáveis.

metacritic,DasEichenlaub,cyberpunk-2077,"Playing in 2025...
Starting with the bad:
Open world is small, since it seems like one can't really create an urban open world or modern open world that feels real,  maybe don't try.  Night city is tiny and there's no traffic jams. 
Glitches, hats don't work properly. Encountered one weird stretching glitch when a body was dismembered.
They still need to proof read the text,  I teach English to migrants and refugees and their writing is often more comprehensible than texts I have encountered in game.
Guns, don't use them in your game if you don't know how they work.  They put too much effort into making the guns gamey. Shoulda made the combat much more deadly instead of sending more bullet sponges at you.
Guns,  cyberwear, perks all involve too much incremental change and or differences between options.
Vehicles handle ridiculously and defy physics. Makes me wonder if the devs even drive. 
You can't really defy or rage against the dystopia and even if you did there wouldn't be any consequences.
I keep accidentally hurting civvies and the cops hardly care and when they do they quickly forget. 

The good
Graphics
Voice acting, characters, story and art. 
They really convey the horror of a multicultural degenerate anarchocapitalist hell with the gross ads and prostitution simulation.
At the smaller scale the environments, individual building interiors, are well designed to allow for multiple play styles and feel more or less realistic besides too many indestructible windows.

I played it with the path-tracing mode on PC and the developers deserve some serious recognition for what they accomplished! But this game took me over a year to finally finish.  I found that I was desperately trying to skip every bit of dialog just to get back out and explore the world. But then the world didn't have very much charisma or charm, and was generally buggy. I would hit a barricade while driving (vehicle handling is aweful) and if I was within 10 feet of a police officer, they would freak out and attack me with full force. The experience of driving around the city ended up becoming annoying and frustrating.

If you have a path-tracing capable PC, I would recommend picking it up on a sale and playing it to experience what truly incredible lighting looks like. But I don't recommend this game in any other form.",6,10
metacritic,hellorty,cyberpunk-2077,"One of the most boring games ever created.

metacritic,Quentinho4,cyberpunk-2077,"Night city, quelle ville incroyable! Un ""petit"" 10/10, un 9,5 si j'avais pu. Car pas assez exempté de défauts pour rentrer dans mon top 20. Mais il excelle haut la main sur certain points notamment l'histoire, ses personnages et ses quêtes. Malgré la quantité de dialogues titanesques j'ai rarement été ennuyé. L'histoire sort de l'ordinaire et les quêtes secondaires sont souvent mémorables. Les personnages attachants, intéressants et charismatiques (sauf le perso principal avec qui j'ai un peu de mal). Autre aspect incroyable, le monde est très vivant grâce aux nombreux pnj et leurs dialogues, les lumières et décors du centre ville, un plaisir pour la rétine. Même si en s'éloignant de la ville on perd vite en beauté et émerveillement. Le gameplay et plutôt bon sans être non plus parfaitement réussi. Pour parler des défauts: trop passif, beaucoup de dialogue et peu d'action. Le système de hack en combat est raté et peu intéressant, la discrétion aussi, elle me paraît trop mauvaise pour être viable et fun. Trop de fonctionnalités et d'améliorations de personnage/équipement, accompagné par un très mauvais didacticiel qui explique mal toutes ces fonctions. Aussi une surcharge d'équipement, beaucoup trop de loot. Un surplus d'information à l'écran et dans les menus est aussi à noter, le jeu est très mal épuré la dessus. La POV de notre perso est trop basse, on se sent très petit. Et sans oublier une grosse quantité de bugs. La musique est anecdotique malheureusement. Sans tout ces défauts, il aurait pu rentrer dans mon top 15, mais je pense qu'il se place autour de la +20ème place. Il reste néanmoins un incontournable selon moi mais loin derrière leur précédent jeu, the witcher 3, qui le bat en tout points.",10,10
metacritic,KillerTeddyB3ar,cyberpunk-2077,"A jack of all trades, master of none, leads to a shallow experience that's still oftentimes fun. Almost half a decade after its release, Cyberpunk 2077 is a fully playable, mostly glitch-free, and enjoyable experience that does everything well yet stands out in no particular category except graphics. Its open world, dialogue, RPG elements, progression system, characters, stealth mechanics, combat, gunplay, hacking, movement / parkour, loot drops, car handling, and basically anything you can think feel fine on the surface and are incredibly fun to engage with, yet the second you put many of these systems to even a remotely below-the-surface stress test or compare them to many other games, they quickly show to be pretty shallow. The characters are written incredibly well, yet with how little time I actually spent with many of them, I never really got fully attached to any of them, nor did I ever feel like I ever got to really know them. While it is great to see systems like the cops spawning and despawning 5 meters away from you not be in the game anymore, there are still times where they literally saw me through a wall and on one occasion through an entire house, because apparently they have eagle eye or something. The many hours you will spend in dialogue are mostly written well, yet with how many times the game gives you two options that literally say the exact same thing, I wonder why the game gave me any choices at all. One of the first options when you talk to Dexter Deshawn is literally you saying either, ""Yeah, I wanna go out in a blaze of glory"" or ""If you die a nobody, nobody will remember you, so yeah, I wanna go out in a blaze of glory"" or dodging the question entirely. Why are they in the game? They just slow down the pacing of an otherwise interesting conversation. The combat with both regular enemies and jacked-up ""Cyberpsychos"" is great fun, and the game gives you a pretty decent amount of fun and powerful options to deal with them. Yet in regular CDPR fashion, many of these can be boiled down to mind-numbingly boring tactics once you know how the game works. Oh, and expect enemies to uppercut the air 5 feet away from where you're standing and for you to still take damage. The stealth is actually handled pretty decently for their first attempt at it, yet you can't pickpocket enemies, you can't just hit one button and kill them with your melee weapon, nor can you shoot a silenced pistol at a camera without the entire building now somehow knowing you're somewhere close to them, or hide an unconscious enemy into a dumpster without killing them for some reason. Enemies in most side quests will be completely neutral towards you, giving you plenty of options to plan your approach. Yet open a door you shouldn't, step half a foot into a restricted area (oftentimes without you even knowing, because none of the enemies ever tell you to back off or to not go through a door, since you can't actually talk to most of them), and within a millisecond every enemy in a mile-wide radius will turn hostile and instantly try to gun you down. Save a girl from getting beaten up by someone; she doesn't say anything, just crouches on the floor with her hands above her head and stays there till the end of **** can buy dozens of different vehicles, yet you can't customise them at all except changing the color on a few. The movement in the game feels really fluent, yet the city isn't really designed in a way where you can use your parkour skills to your advantage. The skill tree is diverse and leads to very different-feeling playthroughs, yet in dialogue it is only used for V to be able to say additional lines of dialogue, without them ever changing how a quest plays out. Trust me, I could just go on and on. But in short; Cyberpunk 2077 is a very fun game whenever the developers decide to just let you loose and give you quests that allow for player creativity. For my personal taste, it is easily the most fun game they have ever made, once you take the game for what it is. Just don't go in expecting to be blown away. 6/10, 7/10 on a good day",6,10

When Cyberpunk 2077 first launched, it felt like a massive disappointment. The glitches and performance issues were impossible to ignore, and I’ll admit, I wasn’t sure if CD Projekt Red could recover. But now, playing the updated version on PC, it’s clear that they’ve done the impossible—they’ve turned a rocky launch into one of the most polished gaming experiences out there. The way the developers handled the updates and bug fixes deserves praise. It wasn’t just about patching things up; they went above and beyond, addressing player feedback and improving nearly every aspect of the game. Night City feels alive, the performance is buttery smooth, and every corner of the world has a level of detail that’s honestly breathtaking. With each update, they’ve added content that not only enhances the story but makes exploration and gameplay even more rewarding. Cyberpunk 2077 is now what it was meant to be—a masterpiece that combines incredible storytelling, an immersive open world, and gameplay that hooks you from start to finish. The dedication of CD Projekt Red to overcome the odds and deliver on their promises is something we don’t see often in this industry. If you were hesitant before, now’s the time to dive in.",10,10

The competitive rank system seems too harsh. Getting the best stats in the game even if you lose, deducts you so many Points rather than taking your individual effort and stats into account to award you a more accurate score. The developers show clear greed in terms of monetisation. The weapon skins are heavily overpriced, and shows disrespect towards players. Not everyone can afford a £50 skin.

Cheaters? What cheaters? Riot does such an amazing job “hiding” them that you’d think they were part of the game’s core mechanics. Players are clearly just numbers to them, not actual people. Crashes? Disconnects? Don’t worry, that’s just part of the immersive experience. And let’s not forget the matchmaking, which was clearly designed by a genius who must have thought, “Why not pair complete beginners with pro-level players for maximum frustration?” And Vanguard? Oh, that was definitely made by the same genius’s equally talented sibling. Bravo, Riot, truly next-level gaming!",0,10

recoils also feel random.
Even if you use the strat to move with a and then press d to quickly stop then one tap either the enemy will just kill you while walking with a one tap or your bullet goes to the backrooms.

Honestly the 4.7 rating probably just comes from losers and virgins who look for uwu e girls in the game which usually are just men with voice changers LMAO


My review is mostly based on the gameplay of the game its not fun doesnt seem right and feels like a gamble not like an actual gameplay, seriously.
All the videos you watch of people clutching are just losers with luck not skill. i've tested every weapon there is just to see random ass spread while once again STANDING STILL.

There is a bunch of different operators that you can choose from, but on the downside you have to use a hero ticket to unlock them.I like how the game uses manual aim and you have to stop moving to get the most accuracy with your weapons. I also like how if you are getting shot at you move slow so you have to try to avoid shots while being slow. One last thing is the weapons in the game are so thought through.A few things i dislike about the game is that when you don't mute peoples voices you can sometimes get hurt emotionally because the community is pretty meantoxic. The game is pretty full with cheatershackers that exploit the game to make it not fun for anyone.This game reminds me of the free game on Steam counter strike 2 with the same gamemode as valorant search and destroy. Valorant also has the same art style as a game called overwatch.I give this game a 9.4 out of 10, because it takes a some time to master but takes no time to learn.

The weapon system is detailed, featuring precise damage modeling and realistic feel that makes each shot satisfying. Maps are carefully designed, striking a balance between open areas and cover points, which encourages tactical and intense encounters.Visually, *Valorant* adopts a more stylized and colorful aesthetic, ensuring clear readability of actions even in chaotic situations. While it may not be as graphically advanced as other shooters, this simplicity contributes to smoother performance across a wide range of hardware—an essential factor for a competitive **** game is free-to-play with optional purchases for cosmetics and skins, although the progression system can feel slow without spending. *Valorant* is a challenging title, ideal for fans of strategy and precision in competitive gaming, though it may appeal less to those who prefer a more casual gameplay experience.

metacritic,Zxnnsrt,valorant,"It's a very well-done FPS/Hero Tactical Shooter. The mechanics are a bit complicated, but that's what brings us back to the original game, in addition to complementing the unique abilities of each character and how well designed they are for the role each one plays in the game. In addition, with the inclusion of Ascendant as a rank, it generates a competitive system more suited to the skills of each player, as well as being a bit more challenging to climb, giving a sense of excitement when playing ranked. In general, a well-designed game, a very good anticheat compared to others, the mechanics allow the casual player to enter the same world of Valorant and the competitive one (although it is somewhat toxic, but those people can be muted or banned) as well as the VCT is well organized and structured.

Something to improve would be the start-of-game system, because many people annoy being AFK, and no matter how much the remake is used, it can be easily evaded. As well as complementing the lore of the game, which seems to be quite extensive but almost nothing is known.

metacritic,tommyash1989,valorant,[SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.],0,10
metacritic,rokamej725,valorant,"Valorant is a dog **** experience from top to bottom and I'll explain to you why.

1. Competitive - This is the central game mode of valorant yet it is the most miserable experience you will ever have. Your teammates are almost guaranteed to be 12 and screaming into the mic because they think it's funny. Then when you try to play to win someone on your team will tilt when they lose a gunfight and start throwing. Lots of times you will have a teammate that disconnects or leaves the match and won't come back. 4v5? 3v5? Tough **** minus 30 rr because you didn't carry. Sabotage is almost never punished even when it is widely reported. The competitive experience is so poor in this game that almost everyone that plays it is unhappy. Streamers and pros alike bemoan how awful it is. The star streamer of valorant, TenZ, would rather play CS2 than competitive valorant, you can find multiple clips of him talking about it on stream. I haven't even touched on smurfs which is rampant. It is actually normal for people to make alt accounts and throw on them to get a much lower rank for competitive. And ALL of this goes unpunished.

2. Unrated -This is the game mode you are supposed to play to practice and learn on before you go play competitive. Competitive itself is already a clown show (see above) yet somehow unrated is a **** circus. All the same stuff goes on here except the matchmaking algorithm is far far worse. What you'll get is players that outrank you significantly all while you are trying to deal with the fact that your players are completely clueless and throwing. If you are lucky, the game will end in a surrender. In fact, you are having a good time in unrated if most of your games end in a surrender because you aren't having to deal with the misery. What this results in for new players is an absolutely useless experience before you end up in competitive.

3. Hidden MMR and the matchmaking algorithm - In every single game mode you have a Matchmaking Rating. It is determined based on how well you are doing (wins/losses, kills/deaths, HS%, etc). They use this to determine the lobby you'll get put in when you queue. Essentially, if someone has around the same MMR as you then you'll get put into a lobby together. In competitive, this means that you can end up getting MMR that is actually higher than your rank and it'll put you up against people who are outside of your skill range. It is doing that on purpose because it thinks you are supposed to be a higher rank than you are. However, you can have a few good games and then get put into lobbies where you are going to get melted because its outside of your skill range. This applies to Unrated, Swiftplay, TDM/DM as well. It's actually worse in other game modes like TDM if you play a lot. If you play TDM a lot, then you'll get a high MMR and get placed against people who out rank you so heavily it's not even funny. I happened to play TDM a lot because it is efficient for leveling the battle pass for the amount of time that I have. What ended up happening though is that I played so much that now I always get matched against people that are way higher in rank than me which in turn makes me not want to play that game mode anymore.

4. Microtransactions - Some of the skins are admittedly cool but overall, the vast majority of skins are not worth the amount of money they are charging for them. There is no reselling for skins like in CS2 so you are never recouping your money. To make matters worse, they have this stuff call Radianite that is very predatory, and they charge so much for it that it basically forces you to buy the battle pass where you can earn Radianite for much cheaper.

I honestly can't say enough bad things about this game. Its **** terrible, the playerbase is universally unhappy with it, and you shouldn't play it.",0,10
metacritic,styrgianfoe,valorant,"The support is good, the microtransactions ethically questionable outside the Battle Pass, the gameplay is great and got me away from Counter-Strike.

Not to mention, when you are trying to level up in unrated to even play competitive you can be level 4 paired against a player who is level 100+. Actually insane match making. And they do nothing about the smurfing players so you can get demolished and lose all of your RR but whatever because fair match making am I right!!!

Even million words would be less for me to express my feeling for this game. This game made me a true Souls Gamer. If you haven't played Elden Ring then you are doing the biggest disservice to the whole gaming community. Probably my favourite game of all time now.

The amount of content here is absolutely insane, and very little of it feels like filler. The challenge ensures that the game, like all others in its sub-genre, won't be for everyone.

La majeure partie des boss sont des bangers, bien sûr vous allez avoir du mal au début, c'est un souls après tout donc les masochistes adorent faire ça level 1, mais pour ceux qui sont débutants au genre, avec assez d'exploration vous pourrez en venir à bout, car le leveling est vraiment pas compliqué dans celui-ci, ce qui en fait un très bon point d'entrée dans les jeux souls de FromSoftware. En ce qui est du 100%, je n'ai rien à redire, les succès se complètent au fil de votre aventure et ceux que vous n'avez pas fait vous guiderons vers d'autres boss incroyables. Mais je dois bien avouer que l'un d'entre eux m'a un poil énervé donc je vais vous donner un conseil d'ami, récupérez le ""Carreau de Gransax"" en arrivant à la capitale pour le succès d'obtenir toutes les armes légendaires, car sinon, une fois que vous aurez battu un boss majeur plus **** dans l'aventure elle deviendra inobtenable.",10,10

metacritic,Darkj_,elden-ring,"Elden ring is a game that has largely renewed the soulslike RPG genre. It is one of the very few cases, if not perhaps the only one where a souls has an organized exploration in a vast open world structured in 5 main regions, each with a lore and various and interesting characteristics. Everything or npc that you encounter on the map turns out to be something useful, nothing is left out, every part of the map that you step on is never empty or wasted. The design of the bossfights is perfect, worthy of a soulslike, the movement, the view and the combat mechanics are the improved version of those already present in dark souls 3. Speaking of the artistic direction, it is something phenomenal that gives a strong accent to the fantasy atmosphere already treated with great care by the background of the setting with lots of dragons, dungeons and an impressive variety of weapons each with a particular function or ""ashes of war"", if it is a more refined weapon. The story, enriched by a well-written lore, is also well-crafted, with endings that can give it different philosophical and interesting conclusions. Elden ring is a great game",10,10
metacritic,Shend,elden-ring,"A frustratingly great game, not only for how it makes you wonder if other developers are even trying, but also for how many annoying, tedious, frustrating, and unintuitive features are buried under an avalanche of insanely good moments. 
Elden Ring stands as one of the best open world games ever made for its uniquely brilliant and dark world, with so many memorable bosses and enemies populating it. It doesn't seem fair to compare it to other open world games like Zelda though - compared to BotW, Elden Ring is linear. This is instead more of a series of open zones, all with so many secrets and bosses to discover, and a lot of freedom in which areas you visit first. Ultimately, it is more restrictive than BotW, but it uses these restrictions to build a deliberate path through the world. There is nothing wrong with this sort of world design, but it is worth mentioning that it does not embody ""freedom"" as much as its contemporaries might. 
Elden Ring did borrow other elements from Zelda, however, including perhaps most importantly, freedom from hand-holding and explanation. You are truly left to discover this world, and it certainly has more content to uncover than a world like Hyrule. From the variety of different monsters and enemies, to the different items of a plethora of builds, the absurd array of weapons and spells, and countless interesting NPC's (with admittedly needlessly confusing and antiquated quests). There is always something to uncover in this game, and the settings are so brilliantly designed that you can't help but delve deep into all of them. The underground sections truly were some of the most insane moments I have had in any game, and the story that unravels as you venture through the regions left me genuinely fascinated. 
This game also borrows BotW's shrine dungeon approach, having many bite-sized challenges throughout the world, yet unlike BotW this game does not skip out on its legacy dungeons. Elden Ring has some of the most impressively designed cities and castles of any medium, which are all filled with a rich variety of enemies and bosses.
The bosses really are the highlight of this game, with countless standouts and memorable moments. Radahn was frustrating as hell, Margit was a crazy realisation of how bad I was at the game, The Crucible Knights were infuriating until I mastered them and then I realised how good they were, and of course we have Malenia, who is in fact the blade of I think Miquella, i think thats what she was yeah.
The bosses are fun and challenging, and I didn't mind the fact they were recycled, since the core combat system was so much fun that it didn't matter if I was fighting the same bosses again (except for Astel, that kind of ruined the original moment). 
The core combat of dodging and hitting is simple and serves as the core of all encounters, but the heavy and light attacks, ashes of war, parries, ranged attacks, consumables, jumps, and ripostes all add a heavy heap of variety. Not to mention the trillion and one build options from the unlimited number of weapons available. Every build is unique and every build is interesting. 
But that isn't necessarily a good thing. I prefer games with just one build, but the restrictive upgrade and leveling system makes experimentation hard anyways. Speaking of leveling, the different regions in this supposedly ""open"" world game have levels which soft lock areas for players until they gain more XP from fighting easier bosses on the critical path. Speaking of bosses, some of them are complete garbage and completely hopelessly unfair, or play by completely different rules than you.
This is a frustrating 10/10, and much of that frustration is the result of actual frustration from a combat system and collection of bosses that desperately needed a bit more polish and balancing. In a challenging game, you want players to be frustrated but motivated, believing they can beat the difficult boss that is giving them trouble by simply getting better at the game and therefore being rewarded with the satisfaction of accomplishment. Elden Ring ventures too far into frustration for many of its bosses that it ends up costing the game that satisfation of overcoming difficulties, since many bosses are bested from luck, cheese, coming back when your character is stronger, or a combination of the 3. It doesn't help that you often die in only a few hits, and despite the stakes of Marika, the game still enjoys wasting your time before letting you try again. 
I could talk endlessly about how poorly balanced and unfair and frustrating and bothersome many of the bosses are, but in the face of what the game gets right, this is more of a momentary hiccup that discourages you for a time, until the world pulls you back in with some new enthusiasm. Still, if the game didn't have such a strong world to stand on, then much like BotW, it would never be a 10/10. Except in Elden Ring's case, this is due to things which are horrible, not just ok or good.",10,10
metacritic,Iamiokua,elden-ring,This is what every souls game should strive to work towards.

Combat is really hard at first and takes a lot of getting used to, unlike most other games. Not a perfect game tho imo, some reused bosses.

metacritic,Bigspin,elden-ring,"After 156 hours I must conclude that the souls fomular doesnt work on an open world. They is so much quantity in this game without quality. Bosses like Margit, Radahn or Mogh are peak bosses but they an absolute minority. All dragon bosses are bad in Elden Ring. They are sadly all bad designed and balanced. They have cool over the top attacks but gameplay wise all the same. 90% of the bosses are reused and boring. The dodge and hit mechanic are its limit got sadly boring in the end.
There is no variety every weapon plays almost the same and armor is useless. Its my opinion but the passive playstyle where you always is sometimes  even frustrating and boring. The dodge timing is now so thight that its almost impossible to create fair **** the parry mechanic in Sekiro is waymore satisfying. Imagine playing against Consort Radahn or Fortissax but with parrys and mikiri counters etc. This would be mind blowing. It becomes a battle between two power houses and not just a battle where you try to avoid the battle. Another big malus is the loot. In the first area. Its fun gathering loot. But midgame the loot is 99% useless because of your build and a waste if time. So you stop looting. But the openworld has only battles, loot or mini quest (conversations). Therefore you stop exploring and start to rush the game. 
In the end its clear that most of the good reviews are written by Soulsfanatics. At least the dlc was able to fix the mistakes of the maingame !",4,10

metacritic,Uncasual93,elden-ring,"**Elden Ring – Arcane Majesty with Flawed Brilliance**  FromSoftware has once again delivered an unforgettable experience with *Elden Ring*, an open-world action RPG that redefines exploration, discovery, and challenge. With a deep yet cryptic narrative, breathtaking landscapes, and unparalleled character customization, the game stands as one of the greatest achievements in gaming history. However, despite its brilliance, *Elden Ring* is not without its flaws—particularly when it comes to enemy balancing and boss design. 
A Cryptic but Captivating Story**  *Elden Ring* follows the tradition of FromSoftware’s storytelling—mysterious, fragmented, and open to interpretation. Rather than spoon-feeding lore, the game immerses players in the **** Lands Between, where the remnants of divine beings struggle for control after the destruction of the titular Elden Ring.  From the enigmatic *Two Fingers* to the tragic demigods, every encounter reveals a piece of the world's history. *Ranni the Witch*, *Radagon*, *Maliketh*—these characters are wrapped in lore so dense that each discovery feels like uncovering a forgotten myth. *Elden Ring* respects the intelligence of its players, rewarding curiosity and persistence with breathtaking revelations.  
Combat – Satisfying, Yet Uneven**  The core of *Elden Ring*’s combat is exceptional, blending precision-based melee with powerful magic and ranged tactics. However, it is far from perfectly balanced.  Some encounters feel exceptionally well-crafted—where skill, patience, and strategy determine victory. Others, however, lean too heavily into unreactable attacks, hyper-aggression, or frustratingly long boss animations where players are forced to watch instead of fight. While this works for cinematic spectacle, it can sometimes lead to moments of frustration, especially in the late game.  Despite this, the sheer variety of approaches makes combat deeply rewarding. Whether wielding colossal greatswords, devastating sorceries, or agile daggers, every playstyle has something unique to offer.  
The Ultimate RPG Playground – Infinite Build Variety**  One of *Elden Ring*’s greatest strengths is its approach to character builds. With countless weapons, spells, and Ashes of War, no two Tarnished are the same.  Want to play as a monstrous berserker wielding a colossal club? A swift and deadly katana master? A spell-slinging sorcerer capable of reshaping reality? The game not only allows this but actively encourages experimentation. *Respec* mechanics make it easy to shift between different playstyles, ensuring that players are never locked into a single approach.  The freedom to mix and match abilities, weapon arts, and armor sets makes *Elden Ring* one of the most versatile RPGs ever made.  
The Lands Between – A World Like No Other**  The world of *Elden Ring* is a masterpiece of environmental storytelling. Unlike many open-world games that rely on quest markers, *Elden Ring* thrives on discovery.  Each biome is distinct, from the golden fields of *Limgrave* to the nightmarish red wastelands of *Caelid*. The eerie underground cities of the *Ainsel River* and *Siofra* add layers of depth, while the frozen peaks of the *Consecrated Snowfield* feel both haunting and beautiful. The verticality of locations like *Leyndell* and *Farum Azula* makes exploration a joy, as every corner hides secrets, treasures, or deadly threats.  Unlike traditional open worlds, *Elden Ring* constantly surprises, offering genuine moments of awe and terror with each new area.  ---## **Recycled Bosses & Overlong Attack Animations**  If *Elden Ring* has one major flaw, it’s the overuse of certain bosses. While fights like *Maliketh* or *Radagon* are spectacular, encountering the same *Tree Sentinel*, *Godskin Duo*, or *Erdtree Avatar* multiple times lessens the impact of these battles.  Additionally, some bosses suffer from excessive animation length, forcing players to spend more time waiting than fighting. Enemies like *Malenia* or *Radagon* often have prolonged, multi-stage attacks that make certain encounters feel unfair rather than challenging. While this is manageable with patience, it sometimes disrupts the otherwise masterful combat flow.  
Verdict: A Flawed Masterpiece**  Despite its imperfections, *Elden Ring* is a landmark in gaming, pushing the boundaries of open-world design and RPG depth. Its cryptic lore, vast build variety, and breathtaking world make it an unforgettable journey. Even with occasional balancing issues and boss design flaws, it remains one of the most rewarding and ambitious RPGs ever created.",9,10

The gameplay and battle mechanics require accuracy and planning. Players can customize builds with several weapons, magics, and abilities obtained while navigating along the field across the map. Boss battles become more intense with the addition of a jump mechanism to dodge some of the boss attacks. Intense boss confrontations with complex attack patterns are very challenging. Elden Ring is a captivating and incredibly fulfilling role-playing game that encourages flexibility.

metacritic,Bakke,elden-ring,"Gameplay:
If you have played any other souls type gameplay, you know what the main purpose is, roll, dodge, hit enemy ones or twice, repeat. It remains fun because of the large enemy variation, but I feel it could have been innovated more. I played the game as a Samurai type guy and for my second playthrough a Mage type. Difference is not huge, but I use ranged attacks much more with the mage and its fun to see all the different spells in the game.

Immersion:
The game has amazing graphics and the world contains a wide range of areas and exploring them is one of the best parts of the game. Honestly one of the best open worlds I think I have played and I rarely wanted to use quick travel. 

Story:
I expected more considering they have George RR Martin on the cover. I get that the game doesnt needs a cutscene every 5 minutes. I get thats not what they want to be. But just give me something..I feel like the game has all this crazy lore and backstory, but I couldnt feel help but feel like that when I started the game, all the story had already happened, and I was just too late to experience it. I wished that, when I defeated a boss, like at Stormhill Castle, then the enemies there became friendly and I sort of took over that area. Instead they just respawn and mindlessly try to kill you over and over, even though I have defeated their leader.

Lenght:
The game took me about 100 hours to fully complete and that was just my first playthrough. There is so much to fight and loot to find. The game also has multiple endings and the amount of characters to play as made me easily want to replay it. Some of the bosses are heavily reused though and just named something different and I often found myself thinking, ""didnt I kill you like 4 times already"".",8,10

metacritic,LordPaarthurnax,elden-ring,"It's not only was the best game of an entire year. I guess it's also the best year of the decade, maybe of all time.

It took me about 160 hours to complete my first playthrough and find everything, yes, I mean EVERYTHING! 

Another 30 hours to play through the game two more times to get platinum.

This game is perfection. The gameplay, the open world, the graphics. It's master class!

The only two negatice points are that some enemies and bosses get used several times but I guess regarding the size of the map and the amount of dungeons it's nearly impossible to recyce some bosses. At least they have slightlyl different movesets or gimmicks each time.

The second negative point is that there's no need to start a new game + but reaching the platinum trophy. If you take your time to look around in your first playthrough there is nothing left to do on the next playthroughs.

 Yes, you can try new sets - but you also can switch your playstyle within your first playthrough due to the ability to let you get rebirthed. Yes, you can use it to finisg questlines you messed up. But if you do everything right you can finish nearly every questline and can obtain like 98% of all items within one run.

New Game Plus is only necessary toget different endings for the trophies. And let's be real. They aren't like crazy overwhelming or something. It's a bit disappointing to play the whole game again for a slightly different outcome.

But except of this two points this game let's me think there REALLY is a god. This game is a blessing, the different options to customize your playstyle, the optics of the world and the bosses, the balancing of the difficulty...I don't want to repeat myself, but...PERFECTION!",10,10

metacritic,Italouh,elden-ring,"Es el menos original de todos los souls, en mi opinión en cuanto a historia mejores son sekiro y bloodborne, mundo abierto?

En fin, fuera de eso, hermoso",8,10
metacritic,yunuselci,elden-ring,"Elden Ring for PS5 can be overwhelming and difficult for new players due to its complex mechanics, lack of guidance, and high difficulty level. Unlike traditional RPGs that offer clear tutorials and structured progression, Elden Ring drops players into an open world with minimal direction. This can make it difficult for newcomers to understand combat mechanics, character builds, and exploration **** challenging enemies and punishing boss fights further add to the difficulty, requiring precise timing and strategy. Without a guided learning curve, many new players might find themselves frustrated by repeated failures. Additionally, the game’s intricate leveling system and vague item descriptions can confuse those unfamiliar with FromSoftware’s style.While the sense of discovery and accomplishment is rewarding, Elden Ring might feel unforgiving for beginners, making it a tough entry point into the Soulsborne genre.",4,10

metacritic,Joqker1488,elden-ring,Boring garbage with stupid open world that has no reward for exploring it. Exploration itself is boring because there are no different interesting situations at all.

Still decent because it has all ds mechanics and coop is fun. 6 on a good day,4,10

Güç dengelemesi birkaç boss dışında gayet iyi. Yapısı gereği ile yeni oyuncular için en kolaylık sağlayan oyun. Teknik anlamda birtakım optimizasyon sıkıntıları olsa da harika görüntüler ve efektler.

metacritic,FliperamaDV,elden-ring,"After playing and getting to know the work that is Elden Ring, we can conclude that it deserved to receive the title of Game of the Year at The Game Awards. However, after evaluating the gameplay, graphics, combat mechanics and plot, we can say that new players may be frustrated by the difficult gameplay and freedom of exploration that the game gives you. If the game is evaluated on individual points, we have some games that stand out, such as the game God of War Ragnarok, which is better (for us) in its narrative and plot, which by the way received the award as the best narrative at the TGA , in front of Elden Ring. Regardless of your playing style, if you want to try the game to see what it's like and end up liking it, be prepared to play for hours and hours, in addition to searching for items, improvements, artifacts and understanding what happened to this entire destroyed world. , therefore, we believe that Elden Ring this score.",10,10

It may have come to your attention that i didn’t give this game a ten, the reason being that the enemy scaling is down right atrocious, why in the world would miyazaki make the definitive open world role playing experience and make it so that i need to go on YouTube and put on some stupid outfit and have some stupid weapon just so that i can beat a boss, it just completely removes any reason to create the character you want to create (which the game does allow you to do).

metacritic,sgerry,elden-ring,"Absolutely amazing, immersive, challenging game. Beautiful, captivating and sometimes, terrifying, environments. Character development is deep and varied resulting in a wide range of possibilities for different playthrough styles. The attention to detail and scope of the world is immense and almost unbelievable - I don't think I've ever seen an open world like this one before. The sheer scale and grandeur of some of the structures is amazing, and knowing that you will get to enter each of these and plumb their, sometimes seemingly bottomless, depths is incredibly exciting. The level designs of the mega-dungeons are particularly good, the biggest seeming larger than  many entire games from not too many years ago.
A few drawbacks though... After playing more than 300 hours and reaching level 201 I was not able to finish the game. The last 2-3 bosses are not beatable for me (Malenia (optional, I know...), Radagon and Elden Beast). I tried for hours, resetting my stats with larval tears to try different builds and nothing worked. No, I'm not a noob or some casual gamer - I've been doing this longer than some of you have been alive. The brutal very end of the game is really too bad. After playing for so long, competing almost all of the side quest-lines and looking forward to the alternate ending(s), I was not able to experience any of the ending sequence. To me, that is terrible game design, not extra challenge. The last fights in any game should only be slightly tougher than those right before them, not an order of magnitude tougher. Because of this alone, I wanted to give the game a 9.5. Of course I can't do that. Giving it a 9 would be too punative considering the brilliance of everything that came before, but have an unobtainable ending is not acceptable. I'm giving the game a 10 because it deserves it - except where it doesn't.",10,10
metacritic,honestreviews99,elden-ring,"Brilliant game. Top 10 game for me. On another play through and over 350 hours in game. Hated Dark Souls Remastered, but adore this game! It takes all the frustrating elements of earlier dark souls games, and makes them better. You are no longer stuck behind a linear pathing/story because of a poor build and can’t progress unless you first die 500 times to a boss. Beautiful game, compelling story, and still the difficult/challenging yet rewarding gameplay that makes these games so fun. You have the ability to make it as hard or as easy as you want as there are elements in the game that make it much easier.

metacritic,moothemagiccow,elden-ring,"Just relentlessly punishing until you hit level 40 or so. Seems to pride itself on not explaining basic things, like, what the icons mean or how to avoid being poisoned. It discourages you from continuing playing, and rewards you for accepting the abuse. You won't ""get good"" at the game, the game literally just gets easier. 

It especially gets easier if you just google how to do things. For example, the first boss can be beaten handily if you find a specific NPC, talk to them, then press a secret button on the ground summoning them to help you. How would you know this was even possible without googling it?

The story, if you can call it that, is very immature and hackneyed. I would review it but there's not really one. Find the shards of the triforce I MEAN the Runes of the **** Elden Ring. Why do you want to get the ring back together? No idea. Why do you want to be ""Elden Lord?"" Don't WORRY about THAT, OKAY.

The graphics are terrible. Everything looks the same. You will get lost because this section of the cave or castle looks exactly like the section you were just in, and you're not sure if you've been here already. Two of the bosses look exactly the same, and they are called like Morgoth and Mirgott or something. No, this is not Bowser, this is Bow-zere, his eviler french cousin. 

The game is kind of poorly assembled.
* There will be a big thing that pops up that says YOU DIED like.. three seconds after you die. You will be wondering whether you died or not and still desperately pressing buttons because sometimes there's a smidgen of life left in you. 
* If you go to a shop and buy armor, you have no idea if the stats are better than the armor you're wearing. Final Fantasy figured this out in like 1998. 
* I can't imagine what the game is like if you use spells a lot, because the guys who teach you spells are just randomly sprinkled on the map, and sometimes they leave their spot. 
* There's no in-game way to keep track of the quests you're doing (unless you google everything). I guess it would strain credulity for your character to use a pen and notebook, yet summoning a transparent dragon's head to breathe ice flames is believable.
* XP is the same currency as money, which, it never felt like telling me? I'm like level 80 now and I have no idea if I upgraded the right stats.
* Yet another open world game that starts with a character creator and face editor for someone who will never show their face because it's either behind a helmet or you're perpetually staring at their back. It asks you to choose a voice, but your character will never say anything except grunts and wails. And be sure to choose a player class, knowing nothing about how the game works at this point.
* The game itself teaches you how to play it wrong. It shows you the moves at the beginning and then puts you on a horse and sends you out into an open world. If you're like me, you wander the open world not knowing where to go and you learn to fight on the horse. Then when you get to the castle you're supposed to go to, aaand they take away the horse. And now you ****.

There is an immense level of detail and a lot of fun exploring to do, and the game actually becomes genuinely fun after a while. At that same point, it starts actually telling you where to go, going so far as to MARK ON YOUR MAP with a BIG RED SPOT where to go next. Why it didn't just do this at the beginning is beyond me.

If someone gave this to you as a gift, sure, play it. Don't believe the hype. If you bought it and got stuck with it, kill some guy named Darrell and get his 'bloodhound's fang' and sneak around places you're not supposed to go to upgrade it all the way.

metacritic,LT_Gruber,wii-sports,"Revolutionary for its time but nothing special anymore today.

Wii Sports was the launch title of the Wii and, just like other launch titles for new consoles, it was revolutionary and mind blowing.

In its core, it just a collection of generic sport games that you play with the Wii remote controller. It worked perfectly however, and playing tennis or bowling felt responsive and fun. It just was a unique experience.

You can play golf, boxing, baseball, tennis and bowling. Each game requires you to wiggle your Wii mote at a certain speed to increase velocity of your throw or hit and in the boxing matches, you wiggle the Wii mote left and right to make sideway punches.

The boxing game was my favorite and I still respect how well it works. You character is see-through, making it easy to see and focus on your opponent. The health meters are a little vague and ghost all of the time in your screen, but it works fine overall.

The graphics are ugly. Even back then, when the Wii was the newest console, the limitations on the console and the “unique” art style of the Nintendo games other than Mario, were immediately visible. The art style itself is cartoonish and jolly, but even then, the facial expressions, the outlines and animations are stiff and look like a tech demo from 2002. The Wii taught me that graphics aren’t anything, but it also taught me that you can drop graphical quality just because your company is called Nintendo, and everyone is fine with it. This reputation was fixed however, with the Nintendo Switch.

You make a special character called a Mii, which represents yourself throughout all the sports games and can also be used in other Wii games. There are limited customization options and nine times out of ten, the Mii does not look anything like you. This is mainly because of the God awful graphics that the game (and the Wii in general) offers and the facial expressions that are dug up from the pits of Hel and stare directly into your soul.

One downside of Wii Sports became quickly noticeable back then and to this day. The mechanics are easily exploitable, making the games ridiculously easy and pointless really quick.

For example, when playing tennis, bounce the ball a few times and let it be tossed back to the right side of the field, just over the net. When giving a good **** on the Wii mote, you instantly fire a unstoppable bullet to the left side of the playing field, scoring every time. The same goes for bowling; a slight tap to the right of the lane and a slight turn to the left, and then throw the ball at full speed, guaranteeing a strike every time. With boxing, just hit left and right and your opponent (or at least a CPU opponent) does not stand a chance.

The games themselves become repetitive as well. There is no variation in terms of different stages, different modes for a certain sports game or anything. Although still fine, after a few hours you are kind of done with it.

Like mentioned, Wii Sports is an ancient relic today, but I still cherish the memory of back then, when I first played it. It is one of those games that you can play anytime on a party or with friends with a couple of beers and never bores.

Definitely recommend this blast from the past.",8,10

The only one I’m not a huge fan of is golf due to the controls, they are so sensitive! The graphics of this game are fairly simplistic but there is this charm to them that makes it look so good. The controls of this game worked really well for the most part, with a few minor exceptions like golf and sometimes boxing. This was where the concept of motion controls originated, and people bash them too much for no good reason. There’s also the training mode with a bunch of fun little minigames, a few for each sport.

metacritic,clem666,wii-sports,"I guess this wouldn't have been the classic it is today if it were not firstly offered with the Wii console. 'Wii Sports' directly showed that this console was a family console. With these family-frendly graphics, controls and handling it had everything needed to get in everyone's hands. I guess that point is a marvelous success.

The sports proposed are varied. It would have been even better if you didn't have to do the same moves over and over again to progress in the game. Plus at the beginning (before the apparition of the blessed Wii Motion Plus) the moves were not that accurate. Tennis is the mini-game you can play while sitting down and just swing your Wii-mote at the right moment. Golf requires a bit more control but that's all. Music, even if funky and joyful quickly becomes repetitive and uninspiring. It eventually goes the same way for gameplay.

Let's be honest 'Wii Sports' was just a demo and we all played it for a way too long time before major games like Smash Bros and Twilight Princess came to our homes to revolutionize the Wii catalog.",4,10

Hardly what I would call “casual”. This game brought people together like no other game has before, and remains the ultimate ambassador of household penetration by a console.

There are much better options to play tennis with a ""live gameplay"" that requires moving the hands, such as Mario Tennis Aces (2018) for the Ninendo Switch, which has both better graphcis and better gamemplay.

From Golf to Boxing to Tennis, no game feels beneath any other, although Golf is still to this day my favourite, but a problem is that while they retain the quality, the quality in question isn't all too good. The games integrate the Wii's remote in great ways, but games such as Tennis can just boggle down to two people swinging without so much as a thought. Talking about two-player, this game isn't the same without someone else to play with. Playing with someone else is almost necessary to have fun this game.

metacritic,ramzes64,wii-sports,"Wii Sports jest zestawem pięciu gier sportowych: tenisa ziemnego, kręgli, golfa, baseball’u oraz boksu. Po włączeniu płyty od razu pojawia się menu, z którego do wyboru mamy wspomnianych pięć dyscyplin, oraz dwa dodatkowe okienka Training i Wii Fitness. Nie ma żadnych innych opcji – wszystko jest proste, czytelne i łatwe do opanowania.

Przed rozpoczęciem gry pojawia się okienko informujące nas, abyśmy upewnili się, czy wokół nie ma żadnych obiektów i ludzi, o których moglibyśmy zahaczyć wykonując wymachy Wii Remote. Dla pewności warto również założyć sobie na nadgarstek smyczkę, aby przypadkiem nie wyrzucić kontrolera z rąk.

Na wstępie rozpoczynając zabawę z Wii Sports radziłbym wybrać trening, z którego możemy nauczyć się podstawowych technik, a przy okazji pobawić się w pobijanie własnych rekordów w mini gierkach treningowych.

Wii Fitness – to codzienna dawka sportu (w minimalnej oprawie). Gra raz dziennie pozwala nam się włączyć i zagrać w zestaw trzech losowo dobranych „mini-gierek” dostępnych z treningów. Po wykonaniu zadania podliczana jest nasza wytrzymałość, prędkość i balans, co na wykresie pozwala określić wiek (skala), który jest naszym wynikiem. Czy daje to coś więcej, niż przyzwyczajenia gracza do codziennego odpalania Wii Sports? Tego nie wiem, ja dałem się w to jednak wkręcić.

Przejdźmy jednak do meritum, tzn. dyscyplin sportowych które stanowią trzon tego produktu. Na początku każda z nich nakazuje wybór swojego Mii, którym będziemy sterowali, a później, określenie czy dany Mii-ludek jest prawo, czy leworęczny.

W tenisie odbijamy piłeczkę robiąc wymach tak, jakbyśmy rzeczywiście trzymali w ręku rakietę. Nie musimy wciskać żadnych przycisków, cała reszta to relaksujące „machanie”, a nasz tenisista biega sam po korcie za piłeczką. Napisać należy, że zawsze gra się w deblu (z kolegą lub z konsolą), wybrać możemy jednak czy chcemy stać bliżej siatki, czy na końcu kortu. Kręgle są już bardziej złożone, bo mamy możliwość ustawienia się z lewej lub prawej strony toru, a także ustawienie lekkiego kąta rzutu kulą. Ruch jaki będziemy musieli wykonać jest identyczny jak ten, który należy wykonać w rzeczywistości. Baseball (najbardziej chyba uproszczona z dyscyplin: rzucamy, lub odbijamy piłeczkę – cała reszta to szybkie zajmowanie baz przez Mii odbywające się automatycznie). Golf, tak samo jak tenis jest równie przyjemny i relaksujący . Nasze uderzenie powinno uwzględniać kierunek i prędkość wiatru, wysokość położenia dołka względem naszej pozycji, kąt nachylenia nawierzchni, siłę uderzenia i miejsce z którego wybijamy piłeczkę (np. piasek lub wysoka trawa). Ostatnia z dyscyplin, boks jest jedyną, która wykorzystuje Nunchuk, i zarazem jedyną, która naprawdę pozwala się zmęczyć. Nasze ruchy to uniki, bloki i uderzenia wykonywane przez odpowiednie wymachy rękoma.

Wszystkie pięć gier w tym zestawie mierzy nasze umiejętności i w zależności czy wygrywamy lub przegrywamy i w jakim stylu – nalicza nam punkty i pokazuje je na wykresie.

Gry chyba nie można przejść, można tylko starać się uzyskać jak najwięcej punktów w każdej z dyscyplin, a po dłuższym rozpracowaniu i dojściu do maximum swoich umiejętności chyba nic więcej nie da się już zrobić. Gra nadaje się świetnie do multi i do odpalania płytki z Wii Sports w wolnej chwili.

Jeśli chodzi o oprawę audio-video, to jest ona schludna. Obraz w menu jest przejrzysty, a podczas minigierek ogranicza się do niezbędnego minimum. Dźwięk wygląda podobnie, w menu słyszymy lekko wpadający w ucho podkład, a podczas samej rozgrywki tylko to – co powinniśmy (żadnej muzyki). W golfie np. szum fal, świst wiatru, szelest trawy i ładnie oddane dźwięki uderzeń w piłeczkę. Wii Remote z wbudowanego głośniczka również wydaje dźwięki, co pozwala „zbliżyć się do gry”, np. w tenisie moment zamachnięcia się rakietą.

Podsumowując, należy powiedzieć iż jest to gra przejściowa między jakimiś konkretnymi tytułami. Razem z konsolą Wii na samym początku może zapewnić wiele frajdy wszystkim, którzy mają z nią styczność. Każdy gracz / „niegracz” jest w stanie powymachiwać Wii Remote, czerpiąc satysfakcję z prostoty (ale nie prostactwa) jakie oferuje nam Wii Sports i nowe sterowanie tej konsoli. Recenzowany tytuł jest świetnym dodatkiem do Nintendo Wii i choć nie zapewni długiego grania (no chyba, że ktoś będzie się bawił w Wii Fitness), to z całą pewnością na starcie ukazuje zalety sterowania tejże konsoli i sprawia radochę każdemu, bez względu na wiek, płeć i zamiłowanie do gier.

It pulled in so many people because it started the entire motion control industry and wii sports was the cover of it all. The game was free and it felt like something more than what it was intended.

metacritic,JoeCastle99,wii-sports,"You cant say you own a wii, if you havent played this game.

This game is one of the best around the world, not because is one of the best selling games, its because this game changed the game industry, using the motion controls of the wii to make you feel youre really doing sports, making home runs, playing tennis, punching that annoying trainer called Matt in the face. Man, those were the good years.

This game made me go to bed really tired because i loved how you could play it, it was so inmersive! I still have my wii, works like it was brand new from the box, and i still play wii sports, and i still get tired of playing it so much!",10,10
metacritic,ShadowSect,wii-sports,"Overall, Wii Sports is still a fun game to sink time into with a couple of friends, and unlike Mario Party, you're not bound to shout obscenities (unless it's Baseball). Golf and Tennis are great, and Boxing is a great activity. Bowling is dependent on whether you like Bowling or not, and Baseball is awful, don't try it without friends. It has some catchy music, the motion controls are up to snuff, and despite some low-res graphics, it still holds up today.

Purchase Score: Get It On Sale. It's currently $60 on Amazon for a New copy, and $30 for a Used copy, but I recommend getting it for less if it's for yourself (unless you're just getting it for multiplayer, in which case Used sounds like a good deal).

Pros:
+ Catchy music
+ Tennis and Golf are brilliant
+ Huge multiplayer fun for years
+ Motion controls work well (most of the time)
+ Boxing is great way to relieve stress
+ Lot of fun with Training

Cons:
- Graphics haven't aged well
- Not a lot of depth
- Baseball AI is incredibly difficult
- Baseball is RNG (Why on earth...)

Recommended Most For:
-- Gamers with a Wii (if you don't already own this)
-- Fans of local multiplayer
-- People who like motion control when it works",7,10

metacritic,celticaway,wii-sports-resort,Wii Sports Resort is a classic and an all time favourite of mine from Nintendo and of all video games. The Wii Motion Plus really makes the games more interactive and the controls are definitely a step up from Wii Sports. The minigames are all fun to play with other people and even by yourself. The variety of minigames is also great and I love the details that make the Wuhu Island feel like a real place. I love the beach aesthetics and Wuhu Island is one of my favourite Nintendo locations. I would love to see the return of Wuhu Island and the return of Mii's being more mainstream on the Nintendo Switch 2.,10,10
metacritic,fexl39,wii-sports-resort,"There is nothing I can say that hasn't been said already, however, this game is one of the greatest game I've ever played on any platform. While the graphics are quite lacking compared to AAA titles released in the last few years, the soundtrack and gameplay are, in my opinion, more unique and far superior to anything else on the market. The sports, while a couple are carried over from the original Wii Sports, each sport has new and different versions, like 100 pin bowling. The soundtrack is beautiful, with some parts being put together while you are playing. This game has some of the best world building through small bits of information collected through the Island Flyover mode. It is surreal to see all of the locations played in throughout the sports placed together on Wuhu Island.",10,10
metacritic,Forza_Milan,wii-sports-resort,"Great game for beginners, shows off how motion controls work in a great way, not as good as Wii Sports (Mainly because Wii sports had more fun sports.)

metacritic,nintendofan721,wii-sports-resort,"This is the sequel to the classic Wii Sports, and it’s even better! Only two and a half sports from the original game return, but there are so many new ones added bringing the total from 5 to 12! The half sport that returns is tennis but in the form of table tennis. Bowling and Golf return, while the controls for golf were vastly improved making me like it a lot more. The controls for most sports work very well and smoothly, with the exception of canoeing which can be a little laggy sometimes. The Wii Motion Plus accessory is mandatory, but it will usually come with the game for free. The new sports include Frisbee, Swordplay, Archery, Basketball, the water sports, Cycling, skydiving and my favourite one, Island Flyover. All of them are super fun to play! This game brings in Wuhu Island as the main location, while all of the sports take place on different areas of the island. In the island flyover you can explore the entire island and learn about all of the different landmarks, you will want to find them all so you can unlock the extras for this game. There are balloons to shoot lasers at as well, which is a fun addition. The original wii sports is fun but this game is so much better and improved!",9,10

metacritic,Alexb1096,wii-sports-resort,"ITALIAN:
Sebbene sia divertente soprattutto in compagnia di amici, a differenza del predecessore sono presenti sfide di difficoltà crescente anche in giocatore singolo. Inoltre la presenza dei ""timbri"", ovvero obiettivi da completare, aumenta la longevità e il tasso di sfida (in alcuni casi neanche bassissimo).

Inoltre sono presenti molti più sport e molte più ambientazioni rispetto al titolo precedente, a cui si aggiunge la funzionalità del Wii Motion Plus per aumentare la precisione dei movimenti.

Unico reale difetto è che, così come in Wii Sports, non sono presenti sport in cui il movimento sia libero, è quasi tutto gestito automaticamente e questo in certi casi non è molto bello.

Peccato solo per l'assenza di qualche modalità online che avrebbe reso Wii Sports Resort forse uno dei titoli più giocati su Wii.

The fact that so much content is played once or twice then never again, makes the amount of content feel small. The second issue is that the controls, even with the Wii Motion Plus still have their troubles detecting my motions. Swordplay is the one I have the most trouble with, nonetheless I still enjoy swordplay. My final problem is difficulty balancing. Basketball in particular. At a certain point, basketball becomes way out of my league of ""good"". Poofesure broke countless Wii remotes and his TV and sometimes I feel the same as him. Now for my final thoughts.

So than I loaded into Singleplayer and was greeted by a pop up, with said I would need a Nintendo online subscription in order to play the games online multiplayer, which is a great feature to have but not in that way, like seriously why do all consoles nowadays have to have those subscription just to use the functions already implemented into the game?Also you do not play your mii, but instead have to make a different one inside the game that look really AIish if you know what I mean.

Nintendo Switch Sports was a game I was EXTREMELY hyped for. BUT, Nintendo decided to be lazy and release this abomination.

The three ""New"" sports, are Badminton, Volleyball and Soccer. Badminton and Volleyball are VERY similar to Tennis, which is better than both of them, and Soccer runs TERRIBLY. If you want to play a soccer game, just play FIFA. I do have to give credit where credit is due, NSS's graphics are INSANE, and the background gives you something nice to look at while you play bad swordfighting.

However, the game runs smoothly online from my experience, and the sports control great.

FULL REVIEW:
I played Wii Sports for likely hundreds of hours as a child. Its five simplistic game modes maintained the same amount of entertainment whether I played it myself or with friends. Part of it’s because I had control over what I was doing in the game due to the Wii controller. Despite Nintendo Switch Sports’s best efforts, it rarely captures the same level of enjoyment. Yes, the joy-cons are sufficient replacements for the Wii controller, but people debated that long before the title’s release. The main area of concern is the gameplay of Switch Sports.

In Wii Sports, players pick between five sports, Baseball, Tennis, Bowling, Golf, and Boxing, or its minigame modes. In Switch Sports, players choose between seven sports: Volleyball, Badminton, Bowling, Soccer, Chambara, Tennis, and Golf. However, there are no minigame modes, and Nintendo added golf eight months after the title’s release when the game it essentially copied included it at launch seventeen years ago. Switch Sports also lacks the charm Wii Sports had with its Mii characters by replacing them with new character models and optional Mii functionality. It’s further differentiated due to Switch Sports’ (almost) always online functions. It’s an unnecessary marketing push towards the title’s online functionality, especially when your goal every few weeks is a new outfit set.

There’s little incentive to keep playing Switch Sports, especially when its chosen sports are anything between uneventful to borderline filler. Tennis, Bowling, and Golf aren’t as intuitive as the title’s predecessor due to the joy con’s higher motion sensitivity. Badminton is almost the same gameplay as tennis, just with a twist, and Volleyball is one of the worst gaming experiences I’ve had because of how little effort is needed to play it. The only worthwhile experiences included in Switch Sports are Chambara and Soccer. Chambara plays much like its predecessor on Wii Sports Resort, meaning it’s also stayed intact after all these years. Soccer, however, includes leg strap functionality, making it a new and exciting experience.

Switch Sports is a pivotal example of lost potential. Nintendo should’ve decided to incorporate the leg strap in every sport it included. Yes, they would have to find new sports where players use their legs, but those game modes are much more interesting than copying what they’ve already done. Using fresh and innovative ideas is why Wii Sports and Wii Sports Resort are getting a spiritual successor, and developers similarly use new technology.

metacritic,sandspeedruns,nintendo-switch-sports,"I will not deny that this game has potential. As someone who has constantly played Wii Sports and Wii Sports Resort for the last 15 years, however, this game is a bit of a letdown. There is a lot to love here, though. All the sports have engaging gameplay, especially Bowling and Golf. I especially enjoyed the ""twists"" put on each game online. However, there is no practical way to progress (besides ranking up). In the original Wii Sports, as your skill rank increased, the opponents you faced became more challenging. However, Switch Sports does not work the same. There are only a few set levels of difficulty, significantly reducing the challenge and replayability of this game. Locking many cosmetics behind an online paywall does not help, either. There are certainly bright spots to this game, but ultimately it is just another example of nostalgia bait that - while the intentions were good, was just another franchise revival.",7,10
metacritic,Demeech,nintendo-switch-sports,"I LOVE this game! It's so much fun to play with my plushies and I love making videos about it!

metacritic,ArxadeBugQueen,nintendo-switch-sports,"Updates can do wonders for an unpolished product, but Nintendo Switch Sports is a great example of what happens when a company doesn't give a single **** 3 games in this collection are extremely similar to each other, and all the games vary greatly in quality, and there are barely any side modes. While I did originally give this game a score of 5/10, praising the fun gameplay but expressing my irritation with the game's lack of polish, I feel it's time I updated the score to accurately represent the game in 2023.

After my decently long hiatus from the game, I returned to Nintendo Switch Sports seeking only to have a little bit of fun. Little did I know this seemingly tiny decision would lead to numerous hours of the most bafflingly dead game I've experienced. I started with bowling, which took forever to find a single match, but when I did everyone took their first bowl and then... nothing. Absolutely nothing happened. The lobby froze, and forced every single person to close their game and start over. What a great first impression that would have been if that were your first game back! After loading the game back up, I was waiting in a queue for another game for 5 minutes. When I did get in, did I manage to have an issue-free experience? No, of course not. Glitches everywhere, disconnects and bots, and barely an inch of polish. The next few hours were nought but waiting for the game to break in the next preposterously silly way, and groan in disappointment that I spent money on this thing.

At the end of the day, I feel I can no longer recommend Nintendo Switch Sports to anyone; the bugs aren't funny like with games like Skate 3 or FnaF Security Breach, and the game's general quality is so pathetic it simply leaves me questioning what the **** the devs were doing with their time. If you want a good sports game, go play the original Wii Sports, or Wii Sports Resort. End of story.",1,10

metacritic,Shamp058,nintendo-switch-sports,"This game is a soulless mixed bag that really should have been a port of the original Wii sports

The game can be fun for about 30 minutes to an hour, but then it just gets boring. Bowling is still the best sport and can be really fun, but the pin physics are AWFUL in comparison to Wii sports, and the curveball doesn't even work half the time, but its still pretty enjoyable. Chambara is also up there with bowling, and is actually and improvement on the version in Wii sports resort, with different swords you can equip, and it's super tense any time you play it.

The other sports are a complete mixed bag though. Tennis and Bad mitten are both pretty fun, but get old fast, and soccer is super mid.

The sportsmates, while i do like them, really shouldn't have replaced the Miis. They're pretty generic.

But the WORST thing about this game is defiantly the fact that it's another Nintendo game that was half cooked, before being released, and it has ""free updates"" that is really just the rest of the game

metacritic,themightymrpink,nintendo-switch-sports,"I’ll be completely honest with this game; this is the most shameless and disappointing product that Nintendo has released, and it’s saddening to see the Wii Sports name being used for such a lackluster game. Just when I thought Nintendo couldn’t have dropped the ball any lower, they did it. For it’s asking price of 40 dollars, it only offers six sports, SIX! All of them widely vary in quality, with soccer, badminton, and tennis functioning too similarly, not to mention it launching unfinished like so many multiplayer centric games on the Switch. While the old and returning sports do benefit from improved motion controls from the previous games, they all lack any sort of satisfying substance, especially Bowling, Chambara, and Soccer. Wii Sports Resort had twice the number games and included all of its gameplay features baked in for the same price, so there’s no reason why Switch Sports should be this lacking. I’ve said this before and I’ll say it again; the Sportsmates feel completely out of place in a Wii Sports sequel and are so uninspired and look almost identical to each other. It’s very disappointing that Nintendo went with these soulless, minimalistic avatars as the main focus in favor of the iconic Miis which are so beloved and have been widely used for over 15 years. Yes, you can play as your Mii still, but it’s so obvious that the focus was shifted away from them and look very odd with the Sportmate’s body proportions. Spocco Square as well, looks and feels so generic and out of place compared to Wuhu Island that it feels better suited for a generic third party sports game than a legit Wii Sports sequel. Overall, it’s very saddening to see such a low quality product come out of Nintendo in-house. I know they can do better than this. They’ve made some of my favorite video games and characters of all time, and it **** that they’ve pumped this product out just to cash in on the success of the Wii Sports franchise by brand alone. Compare this to Wii Sports and Wii Sports Resort, and you’ll see just how inept a video game company can be these days, setting aside any glimpse of the edge, charm, and creativity that they’ve had over 15 years ago.",4,10

metacritic,SwiSearmagician,nintendo-switch-sports,"Nintendo Switch Sports is a fine Wii sports like experience. If you're craving a new sports game with some Nintendo charm Nintendo Switch Sports will probably satisfy you. The main problem with Nintendo Switch Sports is that it doesn't have its own identity. The game is nothing compared to Wii Sports and there are a lot of reasons for that. Instead of using Miis the game uses generic avatars which don't work. You could make a Mii look like basically anyone. The new avatars have a lot less options and just doesn't have the same charm of seeing yourself in the game. The other problem was just that Wii sports is better. The sports are much funner to play in Wii Sports. Even in bowling and tennis I feel like the Wii Sports version is slightly better. While the Nintendo Switch Sports games have detailed backgrounds and better graphics Wii sports is more charming and feels more welcoming. The new sports added in the game are not great. Out of six sports three of them are new and only one of the new ones is actually enjoyable. Badminton is the one enjoyable new one. You can think of it as Wii Sports tennis but more fast paced and chaotic. Badminton was the sport that I went back to the most. But it is disappointing that the best sport in the package is basically a slightly modified version of tennis. Volleyball and soccer are the two other new sports and they're horrible. Volleyball asks you to make extremely specific movements to hit the ball. Its also just a very slow game. Not once did I feel like a game of volleyball was different from the last game of volleyball. Soccer is not any better. The game feels like a really slow and bad version of rocket league. The field is way too big and your character is too slow. Sometimes it feels like I have to run a whole mile just to get to the goal. Besides the new games there's bowling, chanbara, and tennis which were all brought back from past Wii Sports games. They all work well and are really fun but without the old Miis and backgrounds playing them in Switch Sports isn't as good as playing them in Wii Sports. Besides just playing the sports alone or with family you can go against friends or random people online. From what I played I didn't have many problems. It's not a perfect online mode but it works. By playing against people online you're able to earn new items you can put on your character to make it look more like yourself. This makes it so then there's something you can actually accomplish by playing online and I'll always have something to do. The online mode is the only thing that Nintendo Switch Sports has over Wii Sports. Overall Nintendo Switch Sports is a fine game. The main question is, was it fun to play with family and friends? The answer to that question is yes of course. Although its obvious that this game is not perfect and feels a bit under-baked. Its annoying to see Nintendo constantly make games that are kind of rushed and don't make their full potential. But I would be lying if I said I didn't enjoy my time with Nintendo Switch Sports.",7,10

If Super Mario 3D All-stars didn't exist, I'd classify this game as the biggest cash-grab in Nintendo's history (which says a lot). You've got six games and one coming later. Of every game there is just the bare minimum and, except maybe for soccer, they've all been done better before by Nintendo themselves.

If you compare it to Wii Sports or, much better, Wii Sports Resort, this game falls short in every. single. category. Except maybe for the online Leagues but considering Nintendo's netcode feels older than the Internet itself, this is only a drop in the ocean. Even the Joy-Cons feel inferior to the Wii Remote. At least the latter could be re-calibrated mid-game which they somehow forgot here.

It's overall evident that no competent designer of ANY capacity was involved in development of Switch Sports. I've rarely seen worse and less functional UI (except for maybe ubisoft's STEEP).

Its actually good. The controls feel decent and the game respond well. It also supports singles but doesn't support doubles
- Sword fighting
Again is actually good. There's actual customization but its presentation leaves much to be desired.
- Tennis
This one isn't horrible either, Feels like a straight remake of the original with slightly better controls. Main issue is a lack of support for singles
- Bowling
Feels unfinished. Many mechanics from previous titles are missing and getting a strike or spare just feels emotionless.
- Soccer
Terribly unpolished. It just fails to be interesting and the leg strap is worthless and contributes nothing to the main game
- Volleyball
**** to control, somehow terribly unresponsive and overall just not fun.

The game's presentation has a good amount of attention to detail but the lack of customization (most of it is locked behind NSO) and the disappointing soundtrack and audio mixing, combined with the ugly ui its just not good,

Yes losing the analog controls hurt but the d-pad controls are not bad, they are decent and in some ways superior to it's N64 big brother's controls. The new missions for the power stars adds some interest to the games and I mostly enjoyed playing the multiple characters. I did find Wario's extra sluggish movement frustrating and fitting for this time of game. Visually I prefer this game to the original. It may be more pixelated but it looks sharper and more vibrant and the character models are a step up. They replaced the 2D coins with 3D coins and I wish they had done the same with the always distracting 2D trees.

The only reason this isn't a 10/10 for me is because of the controls they aren't that good and it makes the game really irritating to play. Like you will have a lot of stupid deaths because you will keep accidently slipping up trying to make a precise jump but you can't because the controls are so bad that you messed up. Like trust me you will probably be raging more than you are having fun because you will keep messing up because of these bad controls.

metacritic,CinzaColorido,super-mario-64,"It is Mario 64 after all, and I finished that game on the Nintendo 64, which was some of the best platforming experiences I ever had in a videogame. On the Nintendo DS, however, while it has kind of updated graphics (the game looks impressive on the console) and some additional content that I didn't even care much, the gameplay itself does not fit in a console that does not have a analog stick. Playing Mario 64 DS literally hurts my finger and the inputs are not even responsible, 'cause you can't input different intensities onto a D-Pad, so the movement just feels really bad.

The game *tries* to compensate that with the option for you to play with touchscreen input, but the touchscreen on the DS is not that much reliable for a guaranteed solid experience. Most of the time it fails to get where are you touching.

By hurting the controls of the game, you literally kill the foundation which this game was developed upon, on the original version. Mario 64 was developed to get the most of the N64 hardware, as a lot of N64 games do, and so a lot of *exclusive* DS games as well.

So again... It is Mario 64, and it is a legendary game, but this version, the ""64 DS"", just **** for me, and I couldn't even play it past the second or third course. Gave it a 5 because I really, really enjoyed the graphics on this version.",5,10

I wish they improved the boss fight, or the open-world mechanic, or anything that could make the game better. Although characters have special advantages, why is Mario used for everything.

metacritic,vhyles,marvel-rivals,"Original, FUN and F2P game which does not treat its playerbase like a zombified milk cow, because that's what you become when you play the turd that is Overwatch 2 (its 1.8 rating here is eye-opening).
Not only that but you FEEL that the devs have integrity, they love their product and treat their playerbase with respect.
Now what exactly does MR bring to the table, that the still-living and walking corpse of GotY OW 1 does not bring.

1 - Beautiful 3rd person gameplay allowing you to be more aware of your surroundings during team fights and also allowing you to admire your hard-earned skins.

2 - Team-up abilities which enable unique, fun scenarios depending on the heroes chosen, and paving the way for more skill-expression as well as for a more diversified and flexible meta. Considering that by the end of the year we'll have 42 to 44 heroes in total, you can only image how much more deeper the rabbit hole will go for skill expression and tactics, with so many team ups available, some old, some completely new.

3 - 6V6 and Open Queue - the only way a hero shooter is meant to be played. 2-2-2, 1-3-2, 2-1-3, 1-2-3 ---> all these are possible thanks to these 2 features, which boost skill-expression and permit players to experiment with tactics and counters mid-match if need be. Even 3-0-3 or 0-4-2 or other whacky comps are possible to allow for more freedom and skill expression. That being said the highest percentage winning comps are the first four I mentioned.

4 - Destructible environment which allows better strategy making like more flanking possibilities or hampering the enemy team's defense by destroying key points on the map.

5 - Less egregious battle pass... had to say it... Even if Blizz reduce their endless greed and start polishing OW 2 it will still remain a turd, albeit a polished turd.

6 - Frequent updates and developers who LISTEN to their playerbase instead of trying to gaslight them. This year alone we're getting 1 map and 1 to 2 heroes EVERY 6 WEEKS, and balance changes at the same time frame. 
A nice example: the devs were about to mess up by resetting rank on every half season but they listened to the playerbase, did not gaslit them, and said 'ok ok, you're right, screw that, we will NOT reset the ranks of players every half season, but every season like it is supposed to be done'.

Imagine one day NetEase decides to change monetization models for more corporate cash, rebrands MR to MR 2, culls 2 players from the game to make it 5V5 so as to introduce something 'new', and calls it a day?
Nah, you can see that money is important for these devs, but they did not sell their soul for it, unlike Blizzard.
You can see that they have integrity and love for their game.

Hop in hero, we're waiting for you to have fun with a roster of 37 characters whose number increase by the month, many new maps, and new skins and events introduced each season, including balance changes each half season.",10,10

1) Optimization - When rainbow six seige runs better than this, you know you have a problem, low optimization settings are practically mandated to play the game without a $900 pound turbo PC from heaven.
2) Character Design - Some designs in this game are stellar, which makes the other incredibly uninspired characters stick out like a sore thumb, several characters feel archaic, being tainted copy and pastes of characters from other hero shooters, most prominently overwatch.

I haven't encountered such a horrible, toxic community of self hating basement dwellers since League of Legends, but I can't much blame them because it's such an objectively bad game. It's an unplayable mess where every game is predecided as there is no matchmaking. Even in ranked every game is a coin flip to see who will stomp who. I think the devs know this because they've added a very generous ranking system that forces you upwards, probably because they know there is no agency in such a lazy, ramshackle implementation of basic competitive fundamentals. If they remove the chat features and add matchmaking it could eventually be a more poorly balanced Overwatch but if that's the peak for this game you should save your time and pick up something from developers who can create a meaningful experience.",0,10

metacritic,Sp3nc3r_69,marvel-rivals,"Marvel Rivals has one of the worst matchmaking I have ever experienced in a multiplayer game.

It has the most obvious EOMM that will keep good players from winning a lot and give bad players free wins to keep them playing and spending money.

After you go on a win streak, the game will give you the worst teammates imaginable to make you lose and go on a losing streak. If you are close to Rank up, it will give you less points required to reach the next rank, then give you bad teammates, even though you were getting good teammates before, back to back.

When it happens twice, it's a coincidence but when it happens nearly everytime it's by design. I don't know why I ever trusted NetEase to make a game with a fair matchmaking system, a chinese studio known for the most predatory mobile-esk games.

metacritic,Incelticide,marvel-rivals,"While Marvel Rivals delivers solid Overwatch-style gameplay with an interesting combo system, its treatment of female characters is inexcusably regressive. From the start, I was bothered by the homogenized, hypersexualized designs: every woman shares the same exaggerated curves, swaying hips, and revealing outfits, as if the artists were a bunch of basement-dwelling goblin incels whose only interaction with a woman is with their mother, completely incapable of crafting diverse, compelling characters. 
 
I initially gave feedback hoping for improvement, but instead, the developers have leaned further into misogynistic tropes. The recent addition of Invisible Woman features gratuitous breast physics that look ripped from a cheap adult game. Even worse was the promotional rollout for Emma Frost, where the focus wasn’t her gameplay, but the thickness of her thighs, reducing the entire character to a cheap thirst trap. 
 
This isn’t just lazy design; it’s actively exclusionary, reinforcing the idea that women exist in games primarily for male titillation. Male characters like The Punisher or Iron Man are framed as powerful and dynamic, while female characters are reduced to T&A props. In an era where games like Overwatch 2 and Apex Legends have embraced more inclusive designs, Marvel Rivals feels embarrassingly out of touch, almost like a deliberate masculinist backlash against the progress games have made in representing women as more than just eye candy.. If NetEase wants to build a lasting player base, they need to do better. Until then, I’m done supporting a game that treats half its cast and half its audience like an afterthought.",0,10

Além de conquistar seu espaço em um mercado competitivo, disputando com grandes live services já consolidados, como Counter-Strike, League of Legends e Rainbow Six Siege, o jogo conseguiu se destacar como um hero shooter de altíssima qualidade. Com gameplay sólida, servidores estáveis e boa otimização, ele se prova muito mais do que ""mais um Overwatch"".

Toda a ideia de que seria apenas mais uma cópia cai por terra diante do excelente nível de qualidade apresentado.",10,10
metacritic,Lugocain,marvel-rivals,Pretty neat content for a free game. It feels like what OW2 should have been.,9,10
metacritic,StopEOMM,marvel-rivals,"Marvel Rivals boasts one of the most silliest ranked systems I have seen and they treat players like idiotic cows. For example, why do they put bad players in bot matches when they did not consent to it. (I’m ranked plat/gold don’t know if it’s happened to me).

No role que means you get trolls in ranked who pick healer but don’t heal leading to your team losing. This was was common sight in Gold 1 lobbies and it only gets worsez

Really bad penalties for trying to avoid trolls in ranked.

I suggest playing a different game if you don’t like being coerced by the devs to play with trolls.",0,10

Funmodes are generally playable but ranked seems unplayable. It feels like having to win 2 of 3 coin tosses a round if its not domination, domination is a bit better.",6,10
metacritic,Iron_Salamander,marvel-rivals,"Not perfect of course, but it's better than OW ever was, and yes that includes when it was actually good, even though that's been a long time, i.e., pre-Moira.

I'm not a huge Marvel fan, but it doesn't hurt that they have access to a huge roster that is already quite good, with some great character designs and kits. The skins and animations are mostly excellent too, which helps. Moving, shooting, and even melee, which most games that focus on shooting fail at, all feel good, and the game modes while standard, work well. 

I'm not a big fan of battle passes or the price of the skins in this one, although if you buy the luxury battlepass, you can always work on it later, but it's better than OW's full price plus paid loot box system it had, and far better than OW2's current trash monetization.

It sorely needs more map and mode variety, and I'd like some permanent PvE missions as it's fun to mix it up and have more play options.

Tanking and healing are both very enjoyable here too, although not every character is to everyone's liking like any other hero shooter, you will almost certainly find at least 1 hero per role type you like, and that's a big plus.

It mostly runs great for my rig with everything turned up, but it does get some frame drops on certain maps at certain times, not 100% what the cause is, but it's noticeable.

Overall, a fun hero shooter with excellent character designs and game play, so-so monetization, but needs some performance patches and more mode and map variety. One of the better hero shooters I've played.",8,10

metacritic,Daveman,marvel-rivals,"The Good
-Inventive mechanics that breathe new life to the hero shooter formula
-Fast paced and engaging
-Outstanding presentation
-Great artstyle, with some fantastic character designs (Psylocke, Hela)
-Generous amount of new playable characters in latest update


The Bad
-Poor optimization. Has crashed many computers.
-NetEase security measures can be a privacy issue
-Fair amount of bots encountered in quick play

The Ugly
--Some character designs are meh (Captain America). And why TF is Punisher so damn beefy? 
-The ability tool tips leave out some important information (ie. Hulk can hang on walls, Wolverine does damage based on target's health, etc.)
-Some characters are in serious need of balance (Hawkeye's damage, Punisher's ult not affected by stuns), but I'm sure this will change as the game goes on.

metacritic,OnlyOneHere,marvel-rivals,"So I've been playing this game for a while now and I was debating what to score this game. I was going back and forth on what to give this game, maybe I should give it a 4, 5, maybe even a 6. But after an incident that occurred yesterday, my mind has been made up. Let's start with the positives. The best part of this game is that it's free. Half of the maps were well designed. Stuff like the portals and the destructible environments created some interesting scenarios. The launch roster for the game is great and the powers are lore accurate. But the problem with the powers being too accurate to the lore is that it makes the game very unbalanced, but I can see that being a good thing for a Marvel fan who just wants to have fun. Now on to the negatives. Well like I said, it's unbalanced, and the devs were too lazy for a balanced game mode. This game is PvP online with unrealistic player movement and garbage animations, so one might expect the controls to be seamless, right? Wrong, they are way too clunky. The voice acting for the characters are repetitive and awful, the greedy developers paid the voice actors pennies. Galacta's voice is annoying, I just want her to shut up already. ● So I was chatting with someone about classic action movies because the game itself was starting to get boring, and that eventually prompted me to write 1989 on the chat. To my surprise, 1989 is considered inappropriate content. Are you freaking kidding me? I couldn't even write the number 89 for goodness sake. Apparently, this game censored various phrases and terms that China doesn't tolerate. I can't say 1989 because it reminds them about a certain event? What's next, am I not allowed to say Taylor Swift because it reminds them of 1989? Then Cruel Summer? Then Bananarama? Then Karate Kid? Where does the censorship end? I can't believe these sensitive babies get offended over Winnie the Pooh. God, these people aren't mentally sound. Look, I understand these devs have to censor things for China, but don't drag the rest of us down that rabbit hole. I'm a Gen X man, an early one at that, so I am bound to talk about the year 1989 and I had no intention to mention any of that John Cena bullcrap. I am so sick of developers forcing their political beliefs on us. Keep your propaganda out of video games. ● The multiplayer experience was just trash but the censorship made it really easy for me to determine the score for this game. And what is it with these conservative nerds celebrating this trash for not being woke? This is woke trash. Sure this game doesn't deliberately make women ugly like western games, but woke is woke. You are allowed to trash talk America and straight white males in the chat, but can't do the same for ""protected"" groups. Not that I want to do that mind you, but the double standards make this woke. ""I don't care about the chat"" no, be consistent. If you claim to be against censorship, then you can't defend this trash. You let this slide, it's only going to get worse from here. For me, censorship isn't the problem. Game chats have always been censored, but usually it was just a profanity filter, but at least I can swear through voice chat for rated M games. It's the principle behind censorship that bothers me. Stupid control freaks won't let me say 1989 because it reminds them of an event. I demand an official confirmation from the studio that I can at least say 1989 through voice chat without getting banned. Until then, this game is a 0. I don't recommend this commie trash at all.",0,10

Its more fluid gameplay compared to the previous ones and the presence of Marvel licensed characters are enough for this. Characters that we can define as meta in the game are found in every game but since each character's playing style is different here, the meta is spread out among each character. If we play all the characters with their full performance, they would be very strong but this is where the difficulties of the characters come into play. Difficult characters become very strong if played well. Well, this is already the case in most games but what is different from other games is that the real heroes of this game are not those who get a lot of kills but who gives more life to the tank characters.

Only complaints is it's mildly poorly optimized I haven't had much issue other than huge lag spikes once in awhile but I notice other people can't even get into a game without crashing so hopefully they fix everything there's also a thing where when you jump into the game it takes complete control over your mic so you can't even talk to your friends on discord without running discord as admin.

metacritic,CnPx98,marvel-rivals,"It's a fun game that clearly aims more towards fun gameplay then a competitive experience. However, the game is a bit buggy. Like sometimes your character takes ages to spawn, so your running around with no character on screen.
Despite the Marvel Rivals clearly not playing like a competitive game, the matchmaking in casual mode feels overly strict. Skill based matchmaking (Sbmm) can make games feel overly sweaty, making casuals like myself get burnt out and tired after short play sessions. I have a few hundred hours in XDefiant and my KD isn't that great, at around 1.2. So it's not like I'm a pro. But since there is no Sbmm in casual, every match feels different from the last. This variety helps keep things fresh, rather then repetitive.

My next issue is they need role cue. Even if its a separate playlist, so open cue players still have their fun. I don't mind this game not having perfect balancing. I would rather have a bunch of heroes, then fewer balanced heroes in a game like this. But we need role cue.

Other then that, game is a lot better then I expected. I can imagine updates will hugely improve the experience. Monitization is a bit steep. At around £5 per 1 month battlepass with just under 30 items. Most being filler. This makes it around twice the price is most other games.
Game has been massively successful, and I think that's no surprise. With it's massive roster on day 1, humourous characters and dialogue and chaotic, fun gameplay.

metacritic,HaloBlues,the-sims-4,"This is really tricky to rate, because everything is brought down by the inherent predatory nature of EA's microtransactions and pricing tactics. The base game itself is hollow, soulless, and corporate. Basic content that was always available in earlier games is now parceled out in sectioned DLC and 'kits' that cost extortionate amounts of money and will only give you a piece of each previously-complete category of content - for instance, Sims 3 gave you Pets (which included cats, dogs, horses, foxes, small animals like hamsters, all of the furniture and items for pets, etc). In comparison, Sims 4 gives you Cats & Dogs, then a separate DLC for Horses, THEN a separate Stuff Pack for My First Pets Stuff for furniture and items. They sell a DLC for their DLC. If you download a ton of custom content, creating Sims is as fun as ever. The graphics are a step up, and it makes it (unfortunately) difficult to return to older Sims games after getting accustomed to this one, but everything else is a huge step back. Once you've created your Sim, it's pretty much just empty repetition. You have to make your own fun via legacy challenges, mods, etcetera. So: my rating is not for what the game can be with your own additions and downloaded custom content, because then it's what you make of it. I am rating it as it is vanilla, which is, frankly, barely anything at all. Pirate it. Genuinely.

However  other than the skill,ironically, there is absolutly no logic in the game. The game will also find any way it can to botch you around every corner.

metacritic,PrintHelloworld,the-sims-4,"Dang this game looks like a fun game for free on steam but its actually not. When you start playing it might be fun at first but then you notice... the absurd amount of dlc's it has is just like a monthly McDonald's paycheck. 900 dollars for all dlc's???(855 euro) Why would anyone in their lifetime spend so much on a building game? Even the **** game called ""Welcome to Bloxburg"" is better than this even tho Bloxburg was based of The Sims they still made a better job at not being a ""Spend all your live savings on a game that will make you homeless"".

metacritic,Poradicus,the-sims-4,"I cannot recommend this game to anyone. Sims 4 is just a cash grab/wannabe online game instantly turned offline. The game I still play is S2 and S3. Sims 3 was the last sims game created. Sims 4 also has too many bugs that EA will never fix because they only care about creating more expansion packs to rack in more money. What that means is those constant freezes or crashing you had, characters animations where arms stretches out like an excorcism happening, or graphical glitches you see will never get fixed. Don't bother save your money for something that will make you happy and worth your time.",1,10
metacritic,lizboobiz,the-sims-4,"The Sims 4, we all know her and love her. The Sims 4 is the fourth edition of the list of real-life simulation games created by Electronic Arts. However, the natural person behind the franchise is Will Wright, who made the original start of the Sims 1 franchise and created Sims 2 and 3 from there. Eventually, Will Wright left the Sims team to develop other games. They were leaving behind a legacy and creating nostalgia for multiple generations. However, the Sims 4 was released on September 2, 2014, first making headway for the almost clay-like version of the Sims compared to the alpha sims in the past. But the Sims 4, compared to the past Sims games, the sims 4 has less color variation. For example, sims 3 allowed players to have a color wheel to pick a color they wanted, or the color gradient included in the Create a Sim. However, for the Sims 4, there was no color gradient; they were set in stone skin tones, and the variation was very inclusive for a game that people paid so much money for. So, for the rest of this game review, I will go over the diversity within the game and how this diversity has grown over the years. Sims 4 has had ups and downs over the years as it has come out. There have been critical reviews of things that EA has done and things that still need to be done in the game to better the appeal of a simulation game. One of the past upsetting things about Sims 4 was that there wasn’t much inclusivity, such as skin tone or LGBTQ+ inclusivity. In the beginning, when the game first came out, there weren’t too many skin tones to make everyone feel very inclusive. In the user interface, different variations of white didn’t make me or other BIPOC players feel very seen or included in the game's space. Also, to the same point, there have been times when the Sims team has left out the LGBTQIA community within the simulation, not including pronouns, so there can be non-binary or trans sims. This isn’t fair because the people in the community feel they are not represented by a group of people, claiming they care about everyone within the community. But would instead continue to release updates at the time that didn’t include these marginalized communities that people have continuously looked down upon. Even at the same time, they would say they cared but not do anything about it, which was so **** fix the lack of representation in Sims 4 simmers (fans of the game) would have to download mods to add skin tones. This mod increased the variation of skin color in the game to include everyone across the board, which fixed a long-standing issue with the game: the lack of variation. When the mods that fixated on skin colors started circulating in the community more and more, the simmers that had these mods became increasingly agitated to realize that people had fixed the Sims team issue that didn’t even work for EA. Their gamers had to fix this problem. But this wasn’t fixed for console players; they had to continue to play with games that lacked diversity or inclusivity. To make up for this issue, the team restructured the user interface by adding more skin tones and different undertones to represent that each skin tone is different; they also included the sliding feature that even more increased the diversity of skin colors in the game. By doing this, they semi-fixed the long-standing issue in the community.  Even as time passed, they included many different cultures that can be represented in other regions of the Sims world. This means most people in the community, from Polynesia to Mexico. For the Polynesian aspect of the game, they included kava parties or even the conservation of an island. It somewhat makes up for BIPOC not being represented for a while in the game. But all the content that has been added now should have been added at the beginning of the game and not restricted behind a paywall even to get the chance to see the different cultural representations.I recommend the game only to people who are willing to make space for a bunch of mods that will make the game fun. Or to people willing to spend tons of money on games that keep different cultures behind these paywalls. It is a fun game where you can create your adventure or families of other cultures. It's fun in that way. But over time, you get to see more and more what is wrong with the game and the game in general. These companies spend so much money and time on games and release them half-baked, which is sad. But I still enjoy the game as something relaxing that doesn’t involve my brain in developing a strategy for beating a final boss.",6,10

metacritic,X_Skinchanger_X,the-sims-4,"Actually a good game, but the DLC policy is off-putting. But that alone wouldn't be so bad, I can live with it if I get something worthwhile for my money. The problem is that the game doesn't really run well and there are lots of bugs. The gameplay itself is good, but when there are hitches or bugs, it's just annoying. What is really brazen, however, is the new system with rewards for regular logins. I don't really have a problem with that, even if I find it strange for a single-player game and it also makes it feel cheaper. Besides, I don't like this kind of customer loyalty based on habits anyway. But the really bad thing about it is that it's not just cosmetic rewards, but also ones that affect gameplay. For example, there will be a character trait for Sims in the next few weeks. (As of October 16, 2024) This is simply a slap in the face for a game that many players have spent a lot of money on.  I cannot recommend the game in this state and hope that EA will change its general course, but I have little hope.",2,10

I rated it an 8 because it is very entertaining, has a lot of gameplay, and is very addictive. A downside to this game is having many in game purchases. Having only the base game is free but can get boring. Buying the expansion, game, and stuff packs add way more gameplay but can get very expensive. The base game comes with 4 worlds but also has a few hidden ones as well. There are many ways to make your sims diverse and have interesting personalities. Making relationships and having a family as well as creating drama are all fun aspects of the game. The Sims is recommended to play ages 12 and up since there is mild fantasy violence.

metacritic,moirons,the-sims-4,"Pay-to-Play models have destroyed the gaming industry in general. My recommendation is to not even bother with Sims 4. There is no real game unless you're willing to pay hundreds or even thousands of dollars to experience it.

Grab Sims 3 or even Sims 2. It's a better overall experience, gives you the same mechanics, and is the game in its pure form. Like most people, I fell for Pay-to-Play for a few years. Those days are over. If Sims 5 is Pay-to-Play, it's the first Sims game that will never get a dime of my money, even for the base game.

It's okay to have add-on packs and scenarios that add onto the original game, but there has to be a full, original game to begin with, and there isn't here. It's not even a game, it's just a commercial for the other $1,000 you need to spend to enjoy this game. There hasn't been any evolution in the gaming industry for 10 years and pay-to-play is why.

While I do like the semi-open world system it kind of has in place, if you want to go to lets say a neighbor's house or something across the street. You're going to have to sit through a loading screen. And if that's not enough disappointment already, the life stages are very bare in the base game. There aren't even any changing tables in the base game even though there are infants for god's sake! If you're not going to play as a young adult you're going to be super bored. Even if you buy packs, you'll still be bored because the fun only lasts from a day or two to a couple of minutes. I didn't even mention the amount of bugs.

Su incompleto y muy escaso contenido se ha ido saciando con contenido de pago que probablemente es mucho más caro de lo que debería costar en realidad, por lo que si no quieres acabar aburriéndote con el juego (debido al poco contenido que ofrece el juego base) lo tendrás que terminar comprando. Quitando este importante factor, el juego es muy entretenido y accesible, y posee un apartado artístico muy bonito (a mi parecer) y una música y ambientación decentes.

You can have a vacation or a day off on Sulani, while living in an apartment in San Myshuno just with one call /the ""Travel"" option/. It's not bad at all.

I am happy that they kept the tradition to have different graphics and animations, than the previous game. You know that every sequel is unique and this one is really fresh and colourful in every aspect.

I am not into the building but by the time I tried it, I can see a lot of new options which are huge pros to the game.

The biggest cons are the endless line of expansions, stuff, kits, etc. staff which might affect the game's quality, but in the end, you are not obliged to buy all of them.

metacritic,Kazahkstan,the-sims-4,"Sims 4 is a step backwards in the vaunted Maxis flagship series. I have never understood sequels with less features than their predecessors. In a game with as straight-forward of a sandbox concept as The Sims, the only purpose of releasing sequels is significant expansion of the assets and functionality of the game, like Sims 2 open-world towns, greatly enhancing the now somewhat cramped single-lot gameplay of the Sims 1. The Sims 4 deprives the player of the metropolitan shenanigans of the open-world town, undoing a full 14 years of game development undertaken by Sims 2 and 3.
Yet, Sims 1 deftly sidestepped its single-lot limitations with huge expansions such as Makin' Magic. Sims 4 represents an ever-increasing frustration in the gaming industry, locking even basic features behind DLC paywalls.

metacritic,Shend,super-mario-odyssey,"The best 3D platformer ever made. Mario Odyssey accomplishes so much with so little; offering a buffet of inventive and imaginative worlds to explore, with an insane amount of collectibles to gather. The music and visuals are top notch, with a story that does not get in the way while somehow managing to be interesting by the standards of the series. 
Odyssey places all its chips on Mario. His moveset is the core essence of this game, and is one of the most expressive and fun of any game period. All his various options of traversal weave together so seamlessly that they make the player feel like an acrobat, and encourage experimentation and mastery to skip sections and make it past obstacles even more efficiently. The cap is a brilliant addition, funcitoning as an augmentation of his movement and combat abilities, while also serving as the gateway to some of the coolest ""powerups"" in Mario history. The Captures in this game offer so many unique ways of approaching platforming and puzzles that it honestly cannot be compared to any previous Mario game. All these captures added to Mario's already vast moveset grant the player an enormous amount of freedom in how they want to tackle every objective.
Unexpectedly, Mario Odyssey takes a different approach to collectibles, by opting for micro-challenges with more Moons spread throughout every corner of the map, rather than longer, lengthier challenges with fewer rewards. To my surprise it works outstandingly well - Odyssey keeps the momentum going in every level not only by letting players stay in the level after collecting moons, but especially by offering moons as a reward for so many micro challenges all throughout these stages, making for a game with persistent and satisfying forms of encouragement. These bite sized accomplishments might not be preferrable to all fans, but I found them immensely satisfying. What it means is not every challenge will be expertly crafted, but the sheer number of challenges there are means that there are that many opportunities for the player to show of their mastery of the movement mechanics. Nintendo really does place all their chips on Mario's moveset rather than level design (practically the complete opposite of Galaxy) and while it might not be strictly better, it certainly works for this experience. All the challenges in this game, no matter how short, simple, long or complicated, are equally fun because it is simply fun to move as Mario in general, and so as a result these micro challenges become seamless extensions to the jungle-gyms which are the levels, as you effortlessly leap and dive from one Moon to the next.
The enemies and levels are of course, brilliant, and are perhaps the most inventive we've seen to date. The Pokios in Bowser's Kingdom, the Gusheons in Bubblaine, and the little onion sprouts I forgot the name of in Steam Gardens - both the captures and the levels have such wild and imaginative personalities that it is honestly impossible not to admire at least some of them. There is more creativity oozing out of the cracks of this game than there are creative ideas in all the games Ubisoft, Activision, and EA have made in the past 10 years. 

Mario Odyssey is a landmark in Nintendo's already monolithic series, and will stand as one of the best games ever made, until they inevitably dethrone it with the next one.",10,10

metacritic,alancito10t,super-mario-odyssey,"The Mario series was always characterized by how tight and precise the controls were. Every video game system and platform wanted to have its own ""Mario"", because they knew a game like that was going to be a system seller. Super Mario 64 revolutionized 3D gaming and at the time, it was a big step for the Mario franchise but also gaming in general. However, and like many other 3D games of the era, it's difficult to go back and feel comfortable with the way Mario is controlled.This aspect aspect improved quite a lot with following entries. Mario Sunshine, Galaxy and Galaxy 2 all retain that precision aspect that is a staple of the Mario games. But Odyssey is a chef kiss in this regard. And that's a big reason why Super Mario Odyssey is the best 3D platformer I've ever played. It has a lot of variety, it is fun, but most importantly, it is SO easy to control. Playing Odyssey and going back to the previous games is really difficult for me because of this **** course, a game is not only defined by its controls.

I can’t believe it but it has been just about eight years since it was released, and I was dedicated to not using any sources like YouTube in order to finish the game, only recently can I say I have one-hundred percent completed every thing. If you dont believe me then go listen to the shiveria theme and watch a speedrun of this game, it never fails to amaze, and the trick jumps you can do are incredible, even if a few of the more memorable ones use glitches, some like the stair skip in Lake Kingdom or the Dino skip in cascade are easy, but just so fun to master, Super Mario odyssey Is the only game I have ever dared to speedrun, but it was worth it getting a time of just under an hour ten minutes",10,10

Most of the good things the game does have been discussed countless of times so I won't go into them here. Instead, I will go into the game's flaws. The game has a few flaws, namely:
- Too many filler moons that aren't satisfying nor that fun to find and do
- Too big of an imbalance between the easy moons and harder moons. Some moons require a simple ground pound onto the ground while others require a whole platforming section. This could have been fixed with maybe moon shards for the chore-like tasks and whole moons for the bigger tasks.
- The challenge rooms are in general bland and uninspired in appearance and a lot of them even look like unfinished tech demos. They are generally not that developed or challenging either.
- The game generally lacks in difficulty which is sad, considering this means Nintendo didn't believe in their consumer base's abilities enough.",8,10

Gameplay 10/10 - Fun bosses, more challenging than I thought it would be. Movement takes some getting used to. The hat is used in very unique ways. Swinging the controller would do specific attacks. I've never seen that done well in a game until now.

A great aspect of Rocket League is its fast-paced, adrenaline-pumping action. Matches are quick, intense, and full of excitement, with constant scoring opportunities, last-second saves, and dramatic comebacks. The gameplay keeps players on the edge of their seat, offering an engaging and dynamic experience where every match feels fresh and thrilling, whether you're playing casually or competitively.

Play all these different modes in tournaments too!  Are you away from home? It's ok! Because Epic and Psyonix made a mobile version called Rocket League Sideswipe.

I liked the game, I stuck with it for a long time, if you learn to play well it will give you a feeling of euphoria. For example: Extra time in a match, the score is 2-2, the opponents are launching a dangerous attack, the goal is empty, it would seem that everything is lost. But then you appear, make a brilliant save and begin your counterattack, after which you score, for this you can already give 7 points, the idea itself is original, I have never seen anything like it anywhere else. You can add one point for this. Next come parameters such as graphics, etc. Nothing surprising, but it is kept at a good level, this is something that should go into the core of the game.

Игра мне понравилась, залип в нее надолго, если научишься хорошо играть то подарит ощущение эйфории. Например: Дополнительное время в матче, счет 2-2, соперники идут в опасную атаку, ворота пусты, казалось бы, все потеряно. Но тут появляешься ты, делаешь блестящий сейв и начинаешь свою контратаку после которой забиваешь, за это уже можно поставить 7 баллов, сама идея оригинальна, ничего подобного я больше нигде не видел. За это можно добавить один балл. Далее идут такие параметры, как графика и т. д. Ничего удивительного, но она держится на хорошем уровне, это то, что должно лежать в основе игры.

Not to mention smurfing, why tf has that not been fixed yet??? Yet you're removing trading, a huge part of this game's casual and trading community?????? I thought I could trust you Epic and Psyonix, and I'm sorry for whatever the lords of Epic Games has done to you Psyonix but you're the one that agreed to give yourself to them, so you're also the culprit in this case. I used to love this game, but now it's going down the EA route, lack of actual content from updates, lack of fixing the highly-requested matchmaking issues and the removing of crucial features with a huge lack of proper reasoning, I have officially quit Rocket League forever.

I never put money in that game and i already have all i want thanks to the trade between player but it takes long compare to à guy  who paid who thats **** epic seems to have forget that's it's à FREE TO PLAY  now they retire the trading between player, new player must paid 20 dollars to have à decent car and not the trash one at the beginning or wait 10 000 Hours to have a miracle in lootbox lmao.
Epic know that retire the trading scene will anger players but they do it any way because they trust the fact that her players are cow who will pay whatever. Its so insulting from them, they add or coriged nothing in years and take back  the few advantage of the free  play player,show them they are wrong and buy nothing.
Epic Games don't care about players they only care about money they disrespect players . it was their last fault toward me i stop rocket league and i will never tutch a epic game again.

Up to try any genre of games and sometimes I find something new that I didn't think I'd like. I own a PC (built by me), Xbox One X, Xbox Series X, PS3, PS4, PS5, and a Switch. I prefer Playstation due to their focus on narrative games. For scoring, I’ll be using the Gameinformer review scale and of coursed influenced by my personal opinions.

(10) Outstanding. A truly elite title that is nearly perfect in every way. This score is given out rarely and indicates a game that cannot be missed.

metacritic,vadhaghl,world-of-warcraft,"I played WoW for almost one year, and liked most of it.
Until I started doing team quests and raids...
There you are, with 24 other players, most of which have done this raid before. Some of them have done it many, many times. But for you it is a first time. And even though you watched a youtube video or two, chaos breaks loose around you. So you run around, try to do something useful, and most likely are killed off quickly.
Do the other players care? They certainly do: They are P***ED that you are not performing as well as they are, and they let you know it. In very harsh, vulgar language, which will not be repeated here. Use your imagination.
Repeated complaints and reportings of some players lead to exactly nothing. No reaction whatsoever from Blizzard.
And some raids just cannot be avoided when you follow the story line...

So if you wish to play WoW, be prepared of this. And if your kids want to play, consider this from their point of view. I am 50+ years old, and found this a humiliating experience. This does not bid well for kids in the same situation!

In more than 30 years of online gaming I have never met so many rude and arrogant players as in WoW. But I hasten to add that in every raid there were also people behaving in a polite and civilized way. Either a minority, or not concerned enough to speak up stronger.

WoW was groundbreaking by it's release, back in 2003, and it's vanilla form has held up for almost 20 years. Simply a classic, that really grasped the shear scope of a massive world, with countless adventures and friendships waiting.
Lots of great class and faction fantasy. Each faction is unique, and so are the classes. Not everyone can interrupt spells, have defensive cooldowns, or can burst. There's pros and cons to each class - Class Flavour.

The Bad:
Biggest downside is the difficulty of the raids 20 years later.  The fact that the classes only really excel at one thing in PvE and PvP, is also up there on the list of potential problems. If you can heal, you're only good at healing - Only exception to this, is the Druid and Warrior, both of which can both Tank and, either DPS or Heal. All others are stuck doing just one thing: What their Tier-Sets assigns them to do. TBC fixes this, though.

Although I may take breaks and the game has had rough patches, literally, it still stands out and alone as the best experiences in gaming for me have all come from this game.

metacritic,Crimson9,world-of-warcraft,"World of Warcraft was a fantastic game. I played classic and I could tell just how amazing this game would have been back in the old days. Yes, modern games are superior in quest design and dungeons, but the lack of QOL here was genuinely a positive thing imo and allowed the community aspect to be far better.

But MMOs as a whole have problems WoW never solved. They are end game heavy, so leveling becomes an empty chore devoid of community, and the MMO crowd consume content like locusts. Its very hard to enjoy yourself in such an environment. WoW classic didnt do anything to address these things, but these problems were not a big issue when you had continuous growth and when there weren't leveling bots, optimization guides, and try hard communities just looking to grind content instantly.

Ultimately WoW's success was about the time it was released just as much as it was about the gameplay and design. And that time will never come again.",7,10
metacritic,lkeplar,world-of-warcraft,"Anyone saying there isn't enough to do in this expansion has been the victim of WoW's past expansions programming them to expect mindless, daily chores instead of actual gameplay.  Imagine that, gameplay in a video game!  There's so much to do, with so much variety, from traditional WoW reputation grinds to mountain climbing to exploration events, rare mobs to farm, dungeons to do, and that's all well before the M+ and raid season open next week.

The storytelling in this expansion thus far reminds me of the good story driven expansions - Wrath, MoP - and has been a genuine pleasure to experience.",10,10
metacritic,ohmygodlygod,world-of-warcraft,I enjoyed World of Warcraft the most during The Burning Crusade through to Cataclysm but it is still a great experience but expect a learning curve if you are a new or recurring player.

metacritic,MetaWaterSpirit,world-of-warcraft,"The Warcraft universe spans across decades of lore building and this game is no exception to that. Any player will find themselves fully immersed into the World of Warcraft lore and the narrative you get experience first-hand as a player. It created the foundations of an exemplary MMO that set the golden standards for most other MMOs that came forward from it.

Whether you like Pets, Dungeons, Raids, PvP, Battlegrounds or more this game has pretty much every RPG aspect you would want. I removed a few points because I feel that World of Warcraft has lost its sense of identity in being a fun game to play - it often resorts to becoming a part-time job, which I feel a game should not be.

metacritic,popPunker,world-of-warcraft,"Melhor MMORPG já feito, é diferente de qualquer outro, a imersão é diferenciada, a separação entre as facções realmente faz alguma diferença, diferente de outros jogos que isso não tem nenhum impacto na gameplay.
Se tu gosta de um jogo que tem muito contéudo e vai te garantir muitas horas de diversão, esse é perfeito pra você.

A progressão é fantastica, durante o leveling tu realmente sente que está evoluindo, ir atrás de profissões, aprender as habilidades, a possibilidade de upar com dungeons em vez de se obrigado a fazer a quest... tudo isso torna o jogo muito imersivo.
Quando tu chega no nível máximo e pensa que acabou, tu descobre que ta só no começo, agora você vai se preparar pra raidar ou fazer pvp e na minha opinião essa é a hora que o jogo vai te prender de fato, se tu chegou no end game, dificilmente tu vai parar de jogar, uma prova disso é a maior parte da fanbase, a grande maioria dos jogadores não começaram recentemente, muito pelo contrário, estão há anos na franquia, pois tanto no pve com as raids quanto no pvp (instanciado ou world pvp) o jogo consegue te prender, esse é o momento que tu costuma a fazer mais amizades e isso torna o jogo ainda mais divertido.",10,10

metacritic,Bahia8000,borderlands-2,"Best looter shooter i have played. Its a perfect sequel doubling down on everything, expanding, and improving its systems. Story is solid, handsome jack is a really fun villain and a lot of the characters here are memorable enough, with fun facts, like tina and her lazy eye. The main problem is the lack of acknowledgement of the vault hunter a lot of times when you do something they take the credit, especially in the ending even tho you are really fundamental to everything you are seen as a mere tool, that is also a 4 man army. Gameplay is incredible, sound design isnt the best but aside from that it has really good atributes, incredible gunplay, gun variety and design, that makes you play the game in various aproaches along with lots of enviroments, snow, hills, deserts and wastelands with varying color palette and ageless art style of sobel. Good enemy variety robots, bandits, psychos each with its own unique enemies, goliaths, constructors, drones and badasses, my only gripe is that you might be fighting robots most of the time (main campaign). Soundtrack isnt really memorable there is a couple good ones but nothing that stands out. Classes are really good, varied with a lot of potential and playstyles and techniques to learn. DLC is really good (except hammerlock one). Tons of easter eggs to games movies comics and books. And not only as cheap as 10$ it has a lot of replay value and lot of content. Farming is mostly optional but rewarding AF and satisfactory too. And there is some unintentional techniques that enhances the game like rocket jumping.
Some issues are incredibly unbalanced endgame where you really need to know the game to survive, and limits a lot your build potential and makes raid bosses something almost impossible without glitching or cheesing. Characters sometimes can be so broken they are boring. A lot of weapons are unusuable in UVHM. Conection issues from time to time. Lacks a lot of qol stuff that is in 3. A lot of side missions feel unrewarding. Vehicles could be better. Shops and slot machines are interesting but needs better rewards or better probability (shops feel a lot better in TPS). Altough humor is pretty nice a lot of times there is cringe and toilet jokes.",8,10
metacritic,smug_hoe,borderlands-2,"this is a perfection of the borderlands 1 formula the gameplay is even better It doesn't have character building issues because the trees are so much better balanced every character is very fun to play with and doesn't feel super constricting to one play style and it has the best loot system I have ever seen as well the 360 version is very well optimized for playing with poor Wi-Fi this game has so much flavor and so much heart in it it's unbelievable, just an amazing game something that I would recommend playing through but I will warn the final boss is a little bit of a pushover",9,10

Additionally, I remember that the inventory menu was somewhat more complicated compared to the first game, which made item management less straightforward.However, the standout feature of this game is undoubtedly the antagonist, Handsome Jack.

metacritic,ZXSth,borderlands-2,"While undeniably possessing the strongest levels of writing and characterization among any game in the mainline series, I would humbly argue that BL2 has some of the least engaging mechanics and gameplay. If you play this game, it will likely be Handsome Jack (as well as some of the other characters) that keeps you hooked. However, this is not to say that the gameplay on offer is not strong - much of what was on offer in BL1 is still here, but some of its novelty is lost, and I personally saw the removal of some of the more niche RPG mechanics (such as levelling up proficiencies with specific gun types) as a negative.

Most people see BL2 as the best game in the franchise, and while I may not personally agree with this opinion, the game is still a great one that 100% deserves to stand alongside the other games in the series, especially due to its strong narrative.",8,10

metacritic,Kio22,borderlands-2,"Amazing game, every inch of this game is covered in bloody fun from beginning to end. The enemies and bosses combined with the loot grinding never gets old and feels so satisfying when you get an insanely fun drop that changes the way you do combat in the game. The loot in this game is ridiculously diverse and allows so much re-playability along with the six different and unique vault hunters you can use, not to mention being able to switch any weapon from one character to another you have. The story and characters are all done perfectly with a plethora of different takes from comedy to adventure to mystery to suspense to emotional loss to badassery and so much more. The unique world and all its designs give it a less dungeon feel and make it seem all most like an open world.

metacritic,Chempion1,borderlands-2,"В 2009 году вышла Borderlands, которую никто не ждал. Во первых ждали совсем другую, визуально игру, во вторых когда узнали, что игра будет с ""рисованной"" графикой все совсем  утратили к ней интерес. Но когда игра вышла, я прошел её просто запоем. Весёлая, самобытная, фантастическая гринделка с невероятной массой оружия. Конечно Borderlands 2 очень ждал, но.
В 2012 Borderlands 2 вышла и жестоко меня разочаровала. Хотя говорят, что игру надо проходить в коопе, я играл в одиночку. Так как найти толковых напарников у меня в то время не получилось, а играть по инету с тупыми, незнакомыми малолетками, убегающими от тебя без спроса или вообще покидающими сессию в самый разгар боя, ну это то ещё удовольствие.
Игра стала сложнее. Но не геймплейно, а просто враги стали более толстокожими. Поэтому приходится проходить по 5 раз одну и ту же миссию, чтобы поднять себе уровень и наносить хоть какой то видимый урон своим врагам в следующей миссии. По этому кажется просто преступлением невероятно маленькое количество доп миссий, которые можно было бы использовать для гринда. Эта сложность начинает сильно ощущаться где то во второй половине игры.
Визуально особых различий с оригиналом я не заметил, по крайней мере на Xbox 360.
Геймплейно это всё та же игра 2009 года. С  небольшими изменениями.
Это всё также одни и те же враги на протяжении всей игры, просто с разными цифрами над головой.
По мне отличия состоят только в сюжете.
Вообще отличия оригинала и сиквела мне напомнили таковые в Left 4 Dead и Left 4 Dead 2. На бумаге их множество, но что бы увидеть визуально нужна лупа.
И так резюмирую. Игра сугубо запрещена для одиночного прохождения. Удовольствие можно получить только в коопе, если таковой подберёте!",5,10

I love Borderlands 2. It's just incredibly fun. When purchased borderlands 2 I would have been playing hours and hours of Halo 3 and Reach with my childhood friend. We then started just playing this for hours and hours. Going through every quest, playing through all the side quests. WE WOULD SPEND HOURS in this game world. Getting to love the characters, the setting. I really need to go back after finishing Borderlands 3 and just enjoy the game again. Been way too long.",10,10
metacritic,coistmunt12345,borderlands-2,"aside from the last single player dlc that released for this game it is the only thing saving the game from absolute mediocrity.

the humor can be compared to that unfunny friend who thinks they are the wittiest person in the room rather they are merely being tolerated because their circle of friends is much too kind and they are not honest enough to tell them that their jokes are not funny and their presence is intolerable and awkward.

the gore is also a sever downgrade from the first one, e.g there is just no crunch when you perforate the various unfriendly denizens of Pandora, it just does not have the same punch the first borderlands did.

also the kooky characters that were added were not funny and only ever cringe worthy in the worst possible way, e.g tiny Tina the quirkiest , quirkster of quirksville

also Antony birch is a  poor writer.

They still support it, and the first year we got 4 great DLC Expansions followed by the 2nd year getting 4 more DLC Expansions even though they were much shorter. They also had 2 level upgrades and the 2nd one allowed you to run the gauntlet to unlock OP8 which made it ever funner. 10.0 without a doubt and i hope Borderlands 3 will be even better. The only negative thing to this game is if your after certain things farming can be a quick or long process depending on what your exactly after, but with 6 character classes and 4 player coop its still one of my favorites to date.",10,10

metacritic,MarvelJoe,borderlands-2,"This is one of my best video games of all time. It like a upgraded version of the first game but way better. We can unlock skins, not take fall damage, you can move when you're down, get stronger weapons, and the map to this game is much better than the first. You have this cool memorable villain and recognize characters from the previous game and it's basically gun porn of video games.

metacritic,raccoondaddy,borderlands-2,"Borderlands 2 does EVERYTHING better than its predecessor!!
The game itself is a post apocalyptic/space western RPG game blended with a FPS shooter.  Honestly, if you like games like Diablo and Call of Duty, you'll REALLY enjoy this game.
Best of all, its funny, flashy and best of all, has LOTS of guns!!

It's main feature is the campaign and doesn't have competitive multiplayer, BUT it does have 4 player co-op which gets more difficult and rewarding when you have more players in your team.  (max 4)

Along with it's DLC, this game will last you a good month with regular game play. (Possibly more with multiple playthroughs)  There are 4 different UNIQUE and two optional DLC ones.  Each with their own powers, skill tree, personalities and play-style.

It's only drawbacks is traveling when you first start and moving to fast travel locations.  On-foot movement is sluggish and make the game boring when you've revisited or explored an area mutliple times.
Also, a few of the quests can get repetitive, but getting loot makes it rewarding enough to balance the repetition.

OVERALL:  Borderlands 2 is a fantastic game and blends a lot of good ideas in an entertaining experience single player or with friends!!",9,10
metacritic,14lalo,borderlands-2,"Este juego seguro que bajo el mismisimo Zeus a programarlo, hilarante, dificil, con un cell shading muy bien trabajado, misiones secundarias divertidas de hacer, con un contenido abundante y por Dios un DLC bastante competente, de los pocos que valen lo que cuestan!",10,10
metacritic,TheArchetypes,borderlands-2,"The first question people will likely ask is, ""Does this game live up to BL1 and DLC?"" and that answer is a resounding ""Yes!"" The second question, ""Is it better than BL1?"" and the answer is ""**** the most part."" So what's improved? Better gun mechanics (sound and feel), more humor, more frequent boss and sub-boss battles, easier to get a co-op game going and see who's online playing, character skill trees are improved, friends can select quests in co-op games rather than having to tell the ""party leader"" to do it, the new enemies are well designed, you can now dismember baddies, you can now tag items in your inventory as ""trash"" or ""favorite"" so you remember what to sell next time at the vending machine, you can now directly trade with people, you automatically pick up money and ammo (but thankfully not loot) and combat is more organic (enemies take cover, flank you, dodge attacks).

So what's the negatives? The new menus are clunky and difficult to parse, missions still consist of mostly ""shoot that"" or ""find this,"" driving mechanics are about the same (though thankfully you don't take damage from hitting enemies as much), level design can be really confusing at times even with the new HUD mini map and sometimes there's simply too much dialogue happening simultaneously. For example if you're playing co-op the first big town you get to is a total cluster as multiple characters are introducing themselves cutting off the others dialogue. I find myself saying, ""what is going on?"" much more regularly during this game than BL1. That said, these are only minor complaints and the additions far outweigh the handful of small issues. In short, if you loved the first BL stop reading this review and go pick up the sequel!.",9,10
metacritic,JaguarsFan,borderlands-2,"Borderlands 2 is a game like no other. I am possibly the biggest fan of customization within a game that has ever lived and this game offers just that. From the millions of different weapons to skill trees to Badass Points and more, this game allows you to play the way YOU want to play. Along with the amazing amount of variety in player customization, there is also a tremendous amount of variety in the enemies and settings you encounter. The landscapes are beautifully done and the amount of places you travel is simply astonishing. I have played through this game 3 times so far and still love every minute of it. I have yet to find a game (besides Borderlands 1) that can compare. If you enjoyed playing Borderlands 1 or are simply looking for a game that offers endless amounts of replay value derived from its sensational amount of customization (or if you love loot!!!), look no further. TRY THIS GAME. :)",10,10

metacritic,johannultimate,destiny,"Chapter 1: A Rough Start, A Compelling Core
When Destiny first launched, it was a bit of a mess—let’s be honest. The story was vague, the mission structure repetitive, and Peter Dinklage’s “That wizard came from the moon” line was getting memed to death. But underneath the confusion was something incredibly fun, and once Bungie started tuning it, expanding it, and listening to player feedback, Destiny slowly morphed into one of the most addicting shooters of the decade.

Chapter 2: Shooting That Just Feels Good
The real magic of Destiny lies in the gameplay. Bungie brought the tight, satisfying gunplay from Halo and elevated it with loot-driven progression and slick sci-fi aesthetics. Firing weapons in Destiny just feels right—each gun has weight, recoil, punch. Whether you’re using a hand cannon that kicks like a horse or a pulse rifle that’s basically a laser sewing machine, the controls are buttery smooth.Pair that with slick movement mechanics, class abilities, and a growing arsenal of exotics, and the result is an endlessly replayable combat loop that stays fun way longer than it probably should.

Chapter 3: The World(s) Are Gorgeous, Even If They’re Empty
Visually, Destiny is a stunner. From the dusty red dunes of Mars to the glowing ruins of the Moon, every location is dripping with atmosphere. The art direction is top-tier—armor looks mythic, guns look futuristic-but-plausible, and the Tower gives off just enough mystery to keep you curious.That said, the worlds look rich, but often feel a little empty. Exploration doesn't always yield satisfying secrets or dynamic encounters. You’ll find yourself retreading the same paths over and over, wishing there was just a little more in the sandbox between missions.

Chapter 4: Story? What Story?
This is where the game takes a hit. The campaign is famously vague. Lore is rich if you go digging for it (Grimoire cards, online deep dives, etc.), but the in-game narrative lacks emotional weight. Characters like the Speaker or the Exo Stranger say things that sound cool but don’t really mean anything. You’re tossed into a war against ""the Darkness"" and just kind of... roll with it.

Thankfully, later expansions (like The Taken King) improved this dramatically, but at launch, the storytelling just wasn’t there. It's not that the world of Destiny isn’t interesting—it absolutely is—but Bungie initially seemed hesitant to actually tell the story.

Chapter 5: Raids, Strikes, and Fireteam Glory 
Where Destiny shines brightest is in its cooperative content. Strikes are tight, replayable dungeons with solid mechanics and boss fights. But the crown jewel is the Raid.Vault of Glass, the first raid, is still one of the best-designed PvE experiences in any game. It requires communication, teamwork, and strategy in a way few other shooters do. It’s punishing and exhilarating in equal measure. If you had a fireteam of friends and the patience to learn its mechanics, it was gaming bliss.

Chapter 6: The Grind—Beautiful and Brutal
Loot progression is both Destiny’s carrot and its stick. You’ll spend hours chasing that perfect roll, that exotic drop, or that armor set—but it’s not always a satisfying grind. RNG can be brutal. And sometimes the difference between progression and frustration is whether or not the weekly reset gives you decent luck.Still, there’s something addictive about it. That moment your Gjallarhorn finally drops? Unbeatable.

Final Thoughts
Destiny is a game of highs and lows. Its launch was rocky, its story was barebones, and its world felt undercooked. But man—when the gameplay loop grabs you, when your fireteam is clicking, and when the loot gods smile on you—it’s unlike anything ****’s not perfect, but it’s bold, beautiful, and wildly fun. An 8/10 feels right: flawed, yes—but unforgettable.",8,10

metacritic,kiozen,destiny,"*Destiny* is a first-person shooter that introduced the concept of a “shared world shooter,” blending RPG and MMO elements with traditional shooter mechanics. Set in a dystopian future where humanity fights for survival under the protection of the mysterious Traveler, *Destiny* takes players across a series of breathtaking planets and environments, each with its own story and unique **** gameplay is one of the game’s strengths: controls are smooth and responsive, weapons feel satisfying, and the three classes—Titan, Hunter, and Warlock—provide a well-rounded mix of playstyles. While the main campaign is engaging, it has faced criticism for fragmented storytelling and a lack of depth, leaving much of the lore for players to uncover through external **** true core of *Destiny* lies in its endgame, with activities like raids and Nightfall strikes offering intense challenges that require strong player coordination, creating an extremely rewarding experience. Raids, in particular, have been praised for their intricate design and difficulty, delivering content that few games in the genre can match. Additionally, the PvP mode, known as the Crucible, adds variety with competitive modes that reward both skill and strategy.Visually, *Destiny* is impressive, featuring well-crafted environments and a powerful, evocative atmosphere.

metacritic,spiritisgodly,destiny,"This game continues to be the greatest ""shooter-MMO"" to this day yet not receiving any updates since 2017. Taken King and Rise of Iron fixed many issues that the game had at launch and as it sits right now, anyone can hop in and have one of the most enjoyable experiences in the genre. The raids are unforgettable, the strike playlist with rotating modifiers are beyond enjoyable and the weapon / ability sandbox tuning that was left the way it was remains close to perfect.

The only faults that this game has is the unfortunate state that PvP was left in with how ammo economy functions. But if you're looking for a solely PvE game, then this one is a perfect 10/10 ignoring the issues plaguing PvP.

Destiny 2 has improved drastically on a lot of issues that Destiny 1 had, but it still fails to be as fun and replayable as Destiny 1 once was. One of my favorite games of all time.

My first hours with Destiny were pretty fun, it has a decent but unremarkable challenge but when I did hit the ""final"" main quest mission I have this feeling of deja vu, and from there I couldn't shake off that feeling. When Destiny truly shines is when you play mandatory co-op missions, the thing is that even those missions will feel repetitive as the bosses are more like sponges for bullets.

Another thing that I really liked besides the lore is the magnificent art direction, weapons, gear and graphic design of this universe are superb,  music and landscapes in the other hand were cool and pretty but I'm not sure they were on the same height.

I really liked my time with Destiny but I also didn't overstay my time there, because as wide as the universe may seem to be, it sure can feel hollow pretty soon.",7,10

From the get go this game feels shallow, with poor exposition and no explanation about pretty much anything. The Story... what story? Absolutely terrible and underwhelming. I thought at some point this was made by Michael Bay. If only it was.

Shooting mechanics are clearly designed to keep players engaged instead of amused. Progression is level and loot based, with a dedication to mindless grinding for ugly looking items. The drop rate of engrams is inconsistent and more rewarding when you just **** around outside of missions and strikes.

So, poor story, poor characters, no universe building, the lore is not even in the game (which is an offense on itself) and the game was released empty, but with two announced Expansions packs. Anti-consumer, that's what this game is.

Don't play this game alone, or it will be a terrible experience. At least with friends you'll be a little amused through playing this exhausting grind fest.

One of the enemy factions are the “Vex”, whose units are named Goblins, Hobgoblins, Minotaurs, Cyclopes, and Harpies.

That's it, it is not a MMO, main quest can only be done with 2 other players and the social aspect ****, it is not an adventure game either (forget everything you heard about Mass Effect, because it's not), it is just a boring FPS, far from Halo or Borderlands.

The world, the loot, the quests, the story, the multiplayer, it's all so bare bones and uninspiring. Truly an example for the ages of how not to build this kind of FPS.",4,10

metacritic,he110me,destiny,"EDIT: This review was written while I still thought there would be more than 10 hours of actual content. Once you beat the campaign, the ""content"" was merely repeating the same levels and enemies to get gear until you can finally get your numbers high enough to do the raid. Naturally, I was really salty about this. The text of my original review giving this game 9/10 can be found below.

Destiny is not a traditional MMO. The world is sliced up into planets, with the tower on Earth being the hub. Buying, finding, and selling gear is incredibly streamlined, but there is not auction house or trading between players of any kind. The Economy in Destiny is purely based on Player-NPC interactions.

So why did I give the game a 9? For one, the enemies are really well designed and incredibly diverse. There are different factions of enemies you'll encounter and each requires a certain strategy to deal with. To describe three of the many factions: There are your standard halo-esq enemies with a blend of snipers, grunts, and heavies; There are your Zombie esq enemies that consist of zerg-rushing zombies and pot-shotting generals; And there are slow-moving teleporting enemies who use horde tactics to overwhelm players. Combine these enemies with varying terrain for different combat scenarios and the game rarely get repetitive.

The gun-play is incredibly refreshing in this age of standard modern-military shooters. The fast movement speed combined with the relatively slow projectile speed of the enemies weapons will make you duck and dodge constantly. Additionally, the hip fire on many of the guns is surprisingly accurate, to the point where it makes more sense to use hip-fire and retain mobility rather than use ADS in close combat situations. Finally, the melee attacks can often dish more damage than the guns themselves. In point blank situations, the best strategy is often to use melee and gun together in a sort of one-two punch that is incredibly satisfying.

The mounts are a joy to ride. Players get a speeder bike very early in the game that can take them from one end of a map to the other in minutes. Unlike other MMO's whos mounts are controlled by a simple point-and-go system, the mounts in Destiny are actually physics driven. The maps are also designed so that you'll never be going straight for long, as you will constantly be weaving between rocks and other obstacles. If you ever watched the speeder bike chase in Star Wars VI and wanted to play that, this is your chance.

The PvP in the game plays a lot like the original Halo trilogy, except you choose your weapon loadout instead of scavenge weapons. Players start out with only ammo for their normal gun (assault-rifles, pistols, etc) and special gun (shotguns, snipers, etc). Throughout the match, players can find ammunition for their heavy gun. The weapons players bring are the weapons they find in PVE, with the damage output scaled to be even. The only disadvantage for low-level players is the lack of abilities gained from levelup. All in all, Destiny's PvP is the Halo 4 multiplayer we were looking for.

I've heard a lot of people say the game is ""grindy,"" and that the gameplay just consists of ""go here, kill mobs, go there, kill more mobs."" To that I say ""what were you expecting?"" Every first person shooter in existence can be described this way. The game, at times, can feel easy but every mission has a hard mode attached to it that is often overlooked. Playing on hard mode on a mission your level is a challenge similar to playing halo on Legendary.

All in all, Destiny is a mediocre MMO, but a Superb shooter. Playing solo is quite fun, and playing with friends is a grand experience. It is well worth the price of $60, especially when compared to other games of a similar pricetag. If you like Halo or other shooters, and don't care about MMO elements, then buy this game!",6,10
metacritic,mordin1999,destiny,"What a piece of junk!
Just to clarify: I am a network engineer in my day-job, so the network setup in my home is no problem.
After wasting my weekend with troubleshooting (and adding port-forwarding ... etc.), I finally hooked up my PS4 directly to my cable-modem as only device with Internet so it can do whatever it wants to ... and it still says ""marionberry"" - no connection.
I cannot return the ""game"" to Gamestop as it is open. Now I have a $40 coaster.
During my troubleshooting I saw others have similar issues where it does not work on their home-Internet-connection, but at a neighbor it works. Other had to change their DNS-servers to make it work ... and so on. Needless to say, I tried all of those suggestions as well - to no avail.
What game needs tweaking with DNS-servers to make it work??? I only see issues like that with crappy written/ implemented software at my job.

Not Fun anymore
With Destiny 2 around the corner I thought I’d give the original Destiny a try to see what all of the fuss is about...
And apparently it’s the expansions because it’s not here in the base game...
And with activision shutting down multiplayer modes for those expansions the month this review comes out I’m not going to even bother them...
So while I’m sure Destiny is now this great experience with all its ad ons...
I’m going to just talk about the base game which is a repetitive and boring joke…
Destiny is a competitive and cooperative online only first person shooter where you play as 1 of 3 classes and create your own character
As an aggressive player I played as a titan..
There are 2 bases in this game that you turn in your quest progress 2, get new missions, fork out your real life cash for any weapons that are worth anything from loot boxes and get back to the grind of being a guardian…
This game is co op...
But through my entire 9 hour journey in story mode I only had team mates in one mission…
The story mode is practically dead…
So you’re going to have to grind through this excuse of a story mode yourself…
Worse is that all 9 hours take place on the same 4 maps…
the missions just take your deeper into these maps each time..
There are some loot boxes here that are like playing a game of where waldo to find them...
so I just stuck to getting my loot from missions and enemy drops…
Leveling up in this game gives you upgrades for your grenades and suit
though the game doesn’t seem to balance in terms of xp if you are playing alone so late game missions are extremely frustrating..
I was playing through the final story mission at only level 14 because of how slow the game was handing levels out because it assumes I’m going to grind through boring story missions over and over or that I’m playing with other people…
I felt like I had to keep playing in these annoying no respawn zones over and over that would reset every time I died…
But these missions are all the same thing of bring up your ghost, go to a point on the map and shoot all of the stuff until there’s no more stuff to shoot rinse and repeat..
There is a competitive team based mode of 6vs6 like call of duty which is the best part of Destiny as a base game...
Here level advantages are taken away, but you’ll level up way faster than the story mode, you’ll get loot drops, and you’ll have way more fun doing it…
IF you were thinking about giving destiny a try before destiny 2 comes out there’s absolutely no reason to
there’s nothing here worth your time
Give Destiny
a 6/10",6,10
metacritic,HerrWuetent,destiny,"With Destiny1 coming to an end, I have to say, this is in my humble opinion one of the best games ever released. It defines a new genre of gaming, there are not many games that can say that for themselves. Sure, it had its flaws in te early days and it still has some flaws. Some old ones that never really gotten patched up and some new ones that developed along with the game. But that is what this game does. It evolves. The developers are in a dialogue with the players and aside from the odd secretiveness are pretty open about the game. If I compere time played vs money spent, this is easily the chepest game I ever bought. The movement is fluid, the gunplay is snappy and if the beta for the sequel is any indication, Destiny2 will be as good from the start as Destiny1 after 3 years. 5/7 would buy!",10,10

I realized i completed 1 of the 4 worlds in the beta and that all the missions followed the same guidelines, despite a few different objectives but the same idea overall. and then in one day, literally one day i beat the games story. Im not saying a whole day, more like 8 hours. Now i understand that the game really opens up with raids and PVP after the story, but they got stale for me quick. PVP had a good idea but overall after doing the same thing 30+ times you get the idea and want a bit of variety, and unfortunately there wasn't enough diversity to keep me interested for very long. I have heard all of the expansions really do improve the game, and whilst the base game itself isn't a fail in terms of being a first person shooter, i didn't see and justification for paying for what should have been the game to begin with.

I really enjoyed Destiny for a long time. Between nerfing everything and ridiculous decisions they made the game worse as time passed. Then Bungie began making it nigh impossible to be a solo player. Deej kept insisting they'd continue to support the solo experience for a very long time. Well, he's just a damn show pony and a flat out liar. The tide shifted for me when Taken King came out and Eververse was introduced. I've never been so disgusted in my life. I could not believe I spent $150 on this farce. I really tried to give them the benefit of the doubt, but this was the last straw. People will pay for good content. Resorting to microtransactions just shows how incapable Bungie is of doing that. So, they add a gate for content which forces you to get DLC. Otherwise your character is essentially useless.
I don't know what happened to Bungie (Activision?) but Destiny completely changed my outlook on games. I am now very cynical. I used to be happy go lucky and optimistic, but nowadays companies have to earn my money. I take very little on faith anymore.
People quitting or being fired before release should have been a huge red flag.
Their incompetence on having to rely on out of game assets to do things is also appalling.

metacritic,johannultimate,destiny-2,"Ambitious, Addictive, and Sometimes Aggravating

Destiny 2 is the kind of game that shows flashes of brilliance but can’t always maintain its momentum. As a first-person shooter, it’s easily one of the best in the genre—tight mechanics, satisfying feedback, and some of the most creative enemy designs and environments you’ll see. 

Bungie clearly hasn’t lost its touch when it comes to **** campaign is a step up from the first game, offering a more structured and cinematic experience. But once the story wraps up, Destiny 2 settles into a familiar pattern of grinding, gear-chasing, and seasonal resets. 

Sometimes it feels rewarding. Other times, it feels like **** social aspect shines when playing with friends. Raids and high-level content can be thrilling, with real coordination and team synergy. But solo players may find the experience more uneven, and the barrier to entry for endgame activities can feel punishing without a consistent fireteam.

The evolving “live-service” nature of the game is both its strength and its biggest flaw. On one hand, Bungie constantly updates the game with new weapons, quests, and tweaks. On the other, content is often locked behind paywalls, removed entirely, or rebalanced in ways that alienate parts of the community.

Final Verdict:
Destiny 2 is still one of the most mechanically sound shooters around, and when everything clicks, it's a blast. But it’s also inconsistent, grind-heavy, and burdened by the live-service model. A great time for the dedicated, but less forgiving for the rest.

metacritic,Ncalsnx,destiny-2,"Destiny 2 Review
I've been a Destiny player since the first game came out. I have fond memories of Destiny 1, but there were also a lot of frustrating experiences. Finding a decent team back then was a challenge. You had to go online and try to link up with players, but unfortunately, many of them were toxic, often bullying others in-game. It was a weird experience, and I personally dealt with it a few times. After a lot of effort, I got what I wanted back then (the Vex Mythoclast), but by the time I did, the gun was no longer useful. Fast forward to Destiny 2, and honestly, not much has changed. One positive improvement is the in-game fireteam feature, which makes finding players a bit easier, but it doesn't completely fix the issue. You still run into a lot of toxic players who seem to have all the time in the world and think they're superior because they've maxed out their gear. I simply want the Mythoclast again to enjoy it in PvE and PvP, but the grind to get it feels **** drop rates for the Mythoclast seem just as punishing as they were in Destiny 1. I don't have have 800+ hours to grind out raids for just a CHANCE to get it. This creates a big divide between new or casual players and those who dedicate all their time to the game. On top of that, it's tough to find decent players willing to team up if you're not already geared up. Another major issue I've noticed is that the game seems heavily focused on bringing back older players. Weekly, I see them selling nostalgic weapons like Sunshot, Hawkmoon, Gallarhorn, and Suros, which drew me back in, but once I returned, I quickly remembered why I left in the first place. The community still feels unwelcoming, ego-driven, and obsessed with gear. It's not new-player friendly at all. If you're jumping in without a group of friends, you'll struggle big time, especially with some of the convoluted level designs that leave you scratching your head and having to go to YouTube walkthroughs. Now, the worst part is that Destiny 2 feels like a pay-to-win game. After hooking new players, they hit you with expansion packs that total up to around $250 - $300 if you want access to the best guns and content. Why would anyone pay $300 for a gun and a raid that they'll probably do once for some gear they won't use again? I've been playing for about a week now, and I'm already tired of it. Now, I just log in every Tuesday to see if I can find a decent group for a raid, and after that, I close the game. I know that when I eventually get the Vex, I'll play a couple of times and drop the game for good.
Suggestions to Fix the Game
1. Stop the Pay-to-Win Model: Locking the best content and weapons behind a massive paywall of expansions is a big issue. Players should be able to earn top-tier gear through in-game progression, not just by buying expansions.
2. Revamp Raiding or Make It Optional: Raids, while a staple of Destiny, are what's dividing the community. They're not accessible to everyone, and the reliance on raids to get top gear isolates casual players. If you can't find a solid raid group or don't have hours to dedicate, you're out of luck. Either simplify raids, reduce team sizes, or offer alternative ways to earn top-tier loot.
3. Make Top Gear More Accessible: Everyone should have a path to earn top-tier gear, even it they don't have hundreds of hours or a dedicated raid team. Weekly or monthly solo challenges, smaller public events, or alternative PvE modes should reward high-end weapons and armor.
4. Improve the New Player Experience: The game isn't friendly to new players at all. There needs to be a better onboarding process with clearer tutorials and mission structures. The game should guide new players in learning mechanics without making them feel overwhelmed or needing to consult YouTube every few minutes.
5. Reduce Toxicity by PromotingTeamwork: Implement skill-based matchmaking for both PvP and co-op content, helping players find better teammates instead of throwing them into groups where they're made to feel inferior because of their gear. Introduce a mentorship system where experienced players can help new players for in-game rewards.
6. Balance the Economy: Instead of locking powerful weapons behind expansions, focus in-game purchases on cosmetic items. Skins, emotes, and other visual customization should be the primary focus of the marketplace. This way, players can enjoy the game without feeling pressured to pay to stay competitive.",4,10

Eventually all the content becomes very repetitive and stale. There's a lack of real progression knowing that your progress is going to be wiped by next season and that you need to buy a season pass to progress the level system. Sometimes it feels like I'm stuck in loading screens 30-45% of the time. Navigating the UI is somewhat painful. The story is also disjointed and incomprehensible for new players.

metacritic,Xx_Chili_Dog_Xx,destiny-2,"Hey there, it’s me! I’m here to talk about Destiny 2. Let me tell you, this game has been a rollercoaster of emotions for me. I’m not sure if it’s the game itself or just my addictive personality, but I can’t seem to put it down. It’s like a black hole that **** me in and never lets me go.

First, let’s talk about the game’s addictive nature. I’m not sure what it is about Destiny 2, but it’s like a black hole that **** you in and never lets you go. I’ve been playing the game for the past 2 years straight, and I’ve accumulated over 7000 hours of playtime. That’s more than 291 days! It’s starting to take a toll on my life, and I’m not sure how to stop. I’ve tried to quit multiple times, but I always find myself coming back to the game. It’s like I’m addicted to it. It makes me anxious and **** game’s recent decision to vault three years of content has had a devastating effect on my 7-year-old son James. He was so attached to his favorite characters and locations, and now they’re all gone. It’s like he’s lost a part of himself, and I’m not sure if he’ll ever get it back. He’s been crying himself to sleep every night, and I don’t know how to comfort him. It’s heartbreaking to see him like this. I’ve tried to explain to him that it’s just a game, but he doesn’t understand. He thinks that his favorite characters are gone forever, and I don’t know how to convince him otherwise. It makes me sad and **** 16-year-old son Logan has also been affected by the game. He’s been playing it nonstop, and it’s gotten to the point where he won’t even talk to me or his boyfriend Alfonso. He’s just completely obsessed with the game, and I’m worried that it’s going to ruin his life. He’s always been a good kid, but ever since he started playing Destiny 2, he’s changed. He’s become more distant and irritable, and I don’t know how to help him. I’ve tried to talk to him about it, but he just gets angry and defensive. I’m at a loss for what to do. It makes me worried and **** for me, I’ve been playing the game for the past 2 years straight. I’ve accumulated over 7000 hours of playtime, and it’s starting to take a toll on my life. My wife is threatening to leave me because I’ve become a raging alcoholic due to the game’s addictive nature. I can’t seem to stop playing, even though I know it’s ruining my life. I’ve lost my job, my friends, and my family because of this game. It’s like I’m trapped in a never-ending cycle of addiction, and I don’t know how to break free. I’ve tried to quit multiple times, but I always find myself coming back to the game. It’s like I’m addicted to it. It makes me depressed and **** then there’s Cade6. Oh, Cade6. I’m obsessed with him. I treat him like my virtual spouse, and my real wife is very displeased by this. She thinks I’m having an affair with a video game character, and I can’t really blame her. I mean, I spend more time with Cade6 than I do with her. It’s like he’s become a part of me, and I can’t let him go. I’ve even started to have dreams about him, and it’s starting to affect my sleep. I wake up in the middle of the night, sweating and shaking, and I can’t go back to sleep. It’s like he’s haunting me. It makes me obsessed and disturbed.Overall, I’d give Destiny 2 a 3 out of 10. It’s just too addictive, and it’s ruining my life and the lives of those around me. Please do not play this game, trust me you’ll thank me later.",3,10

Whether these details make sense or not. I highly guess most of the negative review people love the fast and furious series, which is in no way as real world as they make it out to be. The only reason I can't give the game a 10 is because their servers are very choppy when new seasons are about to drop.

metacritic,deplorable,destiny-2,"Let's start off with the base game, and first 2 expansions are no longer available to play. I mean Bungie is coming up with excuses but have you ever seen MMOs do this without properly ensuring previous content is playable (very rarely) even division 1 could still be played. Bungie are just awful developers. One Trick ponies. They can do gameplay that's it. They can't do stories, they can't do anything else very well.

As for the expansions you can play, well as long as you haven't done forsaken, you can still play it. I couldn't but someone said you could, and if you have only like 3 missions are available (1 per week). just really bad. Shadow keep isn't even worth mentioning i mean that expansion was so weak with content i'm surprised they don't call that the base game. They have amended the base game start to try and compensate but it isn't well done or thought through (typical bungie let's be honest, story threads are not their strongest point). Beyond Light was dull, because - same enemies, same stuff that you've been doing, very little diferrent.

Witch queen slightly better (filled with the usual mission breaking quests even now in 2023) and ""lightfall"" the new one is lifeless, again same enemies... although ONE, one new type but not interesting enough to go ""yes finally"". i mean i'm not sure why this is even still going.

Anything under a 7 would be unfair because of the sheer amount of time I have spent with my brothers here but I certainly would not recommend this game per se.

It started off as a pay-to-win game with a paper-thin story and little free content, but has developed into a gripping, genuinely fun and exciting game. The storytelling has made massive leaps from the start and it is now one of, if not the best multiplayer shooters around. The RPG quality to the game has improved, and the modification and customisation choices available allow for very unique gameplay compared to other shooters. The music is truly stunning and the scenery only adds to the immersive experience. There is so much to enjoy in this game once you complete the first steps, with many different routes for the player can take: You can play PvP only if you feel that's for you; you can play the story if you want to truly get involved in the lore; and you can play strikes with clanmates or others if you want a teamwork-type environment; or you can enjoy all of these different aspects for a wholesome and enjoyable game  The *only* flaw, in my opinion, is the micro-transaction cost and lack of high-level items in the free season pass.

metacritic,apulido33,destiny-2,"After spending 1,940 hrs combined hours of Destiny, I have witnessed friends leaving, vaulting of content, dreaded sunsetting (Obsolete gear), and massive grinding experience. The situation Bungie is currently experiencing is nothing new as other game studios face similar situations. Maintaining interesting content for their player base is no easy feat, and it is easy to disappoint. Though game developers that learn from feedback and criticism most certainly produce a phenomenal game. Bungie does listen to feedback but the changes are related to in game complaints such as nerfs to weapons/gear, subclasses, and cheating in competitive game modes. The changes that I desire are more exotic questlines, secret dungeons, and community events. They have done these during (Black armory and Season of the Dawn) 2018-2019, and never revisited the following content. During the first 2 years of Destiny 2 raids often released having 6 raids total. Currently Bungie is releasing a frequency of 1 raid per year, and now releasing raids in form of legacy raids that contain minor changes to mechanics. It is very difficult to bring friends or new time players to the game since a lot of their content is paywalled, and vaulted.

metacritic,CamyVero,destiny-2,"I am not a big fan of multiplayer games or games that require a continuous internet connection to play, i.e. those that have a social component. I like to play alone, or if it's in company, I like it to be local, to be with me in the room, each with their own controller. However, I liked Destiny 2, it's a game to get lost in from time to time, shoot a few shots, do a few missions and, on occasion, meet up with some friends and have a great time in a 'raid'. The game also offers content to play alone or in co-op in the form of campaigns, associated with content expansions that expand the game considerably. As a shooter the game is a blast. You can tell that Bungie have learned their lesson as the original developers of 'Halo'. A great game that will make you spend dead hours in a very fun way. Highly recommended.",8,10
metacritic,BillyTheSkid,destiny-2,"One of the PS4's seminal looter shooters, permanently ruined by its own software development team, Bungie.

Immersive, sprawling, and smartly-constructed MMORPG-esque sci-fi with functioning up-to 6-man co-op PVE multiplayer or 12-man PVP, API apps, websites, and all-sorts to support offline administration sorely lacking in games such as The Division 2 that are an administrative burden and brutally joyless ****.

Alas, any goodwill Bungie created with its Destiny 1 fanbase was comprehensively destroyed in 2020-21 by an apparently indecisive, devil-may-care, 'we have your money now so we don't give a flying f**k' attitude.  In detail, Bungie single-handedly ruined the entire PVE side of the game with weapon sunsetting and content vaulting. This generated a situation whereby the most devoted of long-term Destiny players were forced to re-purchase the same content they'd previously paid for, over and over, while other relatively recent paid-for content was mercilessly taken away. At the same time, weapons, armour, and other exotic items that players had spent months or even years grinding and perfecting were summarily confiscated from players, leaving them with a lacklustre, malfunctioning sandbox devoid of new weapons and items that should have filled the vacuum but never arrived.

Despite massive online backlash that caused even Bungie themselves to publicly concede that they  wouldn't ever dare sunset again, the damage was never undone!  So in true doublespeak fashion, despite Bungie publicly admitting it had made a mistake, all players who lost their hard-earned product of hundreds of hours of gaming STILL never received them back again! To make matters even worse, Bungie then poured gasoline on the fire already incinerating what was left of the relationships it held with its player base by re-introducing old weapons and armour that had been previously confiscated, and forcing players to re-acquire and re-grind god rolls on them all over again!

Unsurprisingly, players left in their thousands and never came back, some of whom had played the game for as far back as the Destiny 1 beta seven long years ago.

Simultaneously, cheaters were permitted to run rife within the PVP side of the game to such an extent that all free-to-play PVP has been rendered generally unplayable. Blatant aimbot, invulnerability, limitless ammo, hyperspeed, x-ray vision, and other god-mode software and hardware-based cheats were permitted to infect most PVP modes, right up to and including the pinnacle of Destiny 2 PVP - the Trials of Osiris. This combined with Bungie's clumsy use of a new guardian ability, 'stasis', as a means to force players to purchase the latest DLC at the time, turned the non-cheating miserable leftovers of PVP into a complete farce. The stasis ability is still so, SO overpowered that it continues to ruin the game for players even today. In short, the choice is to either use stasis builds on all your three characters, all of the time, or lose every PVP match you start.

Destiny 2 is yet another sad case study in how humankind has failed to evolve beyond money, and therefore witnesses the profit motive ruin most aspects of life on an almost minute-by-minute basis. Play it only if you can time-travel back to 2014, and plan to cease playing in 2019.

In all, the Destiny and Destiny 2 gaming experience suggests that Bungie is no longer a game developer you should entrust your time or your money to unless you're content to give up both for nothing in return.",6,10

That pretty much sums up their attitude. Why make Fresh content when people spend money at Eververse? Why make fresh content when they can just RESELL content from Destiny OG and early D2 content. After taking it away first, of course. Destiny is the most frustrating and unrewarding game I have ever played. I kept supporting Bungie in hopes management would die off or quit and some fresh people, that were actual gamers, would join the upper ranks. Unfortunately that is never going to happen. Eventually Destiny will become a mashup of desperate streamers and naive newbies wandering around in  a gamer's desert asking for water(content). FYI, you can buy a water bottle at the Bungie Store. Note: it is shipped empty.",0,10
metacritic,Bonk9,destiny-2,"In the current state of the game, and overall im enjoying it a lot. Content is fun, drip feed is ok. But it is very repetitive at times and can lead to a lot of boredom.

metacritic,WillProt,destiny-2,"I bought Destiny 2 for it's PVP, however the game is PAY TO WIN.

I would believe ANY major developer in this day and age would understand this is a poor way to do business.

I fully understand locking new maps, skins, and missions behind a paywall, I understand the developer desire to make money but a game should NEVER lock abilities and weapons that other real life people can Lord over you behind a pay wall, it is not a fair process.

Bungie allows people who pay extra to get devastating weapons like Dead Man's Tale that can easily kill and frustrated players who do not desire or are unable to pay for this upgrade.

They also add inherent class abilities available to anyone who pays, such as in The Beyond Light expansion with the ability to completely freeze other players.

Not being able to move AT ALL is a huge advantage and makes the game unplayable. It's frustrating to have such huge disadvantages ADDED to the base game which can not be overcome unless you pay more money. If you have already paid money for Destiny 2, you should not be forced to pay more to compete effectively.

Either every PVP player should get all new the abilities and have the potential to access all new weapons, OR players should only play with people with the same abilities and weapons, OR give us our money back.

I can no longer play comfortably as I could when I originally bought the game, and changing the effectiveness of people who pay to make it easier for them and harder for those who don't is a very fraudulent and reprehensible act.",0,10

metacritic,BlowItAll2Hell,warframe,"I've been playing Warframe for close to 5 years now and while there are sometimes periods where content runs dry, it does not take long for another fun DLC to release. The game is completely f2p, all money will do is give you cosmetics and skip some minor grinding.

The most recent story arc has been getting better and better; from The New War to Angels of The Zariman, to Whispers in the Walls, to the latest quest: The Hex, they just don't miss. What's great is DE announced earlier this year that they will be releasing small DLCs every few months, that on top of them recently releasing one major update/year makes the future of Warframe look bright.

DE is constantly trying to improve the new player experience so players will not be deterred by the abundance of game mechanics introduced early on, however simple they may individually be. One example is the update Koumei and the Five Fates, which added an easily obtainable Warframe* for players old and new in an area accessible very early into the game.
*A Warframe is also a unique, playable in-game character, of which there are 59. They are often called 'frames' by players.

I myself have never had any major problems with Warframe but to tell the truth, there have been a few times I've gotten bored of it. Over the years there have been a few times when there is nothing left to do except Fashion Frame*, there have been times where I did not feel it was worth the time to grind for certain items / weapons / frames and there have been times that I have found another game more interesting. In the end, I do always end up coming back to Warframe as the great developers, community and content of the game will never not be enough to get me to rejoin my fellow Tenno*.
*Fashion Frame is the process of players customising the appearance of a frame to the best of their abilities, sometimes sending links to public chats to redirect players to a preview of their newly decorated characters.
*Tenno is a term used by NPC's to refer to the player, no matter their current frame. This will make more sense to a player once they complete the main story quest The Second Dream.

After >6,150 hours playing I would still highly recommend Warframe to anyone who likes the idea of a 3rd person shooter full of action, ninja-like movement, a deep story and a helpful community.",9,10

metacritic,th3reaperskull,warframe,"(General Opinion)I've been playing since 2012 and I can say with certainty that the game has improved in all aspects since that time, but I've been disappointed with the current state of the game since 2018 with the ideas of open worlds and I'll give my opinion on that.I believe that the whole problem with the game is poor development organization and the creative team that continues to constantly focus on new content rather than worrying about existing content.(Lore, History and Progression)As we all know, the game's lore has been recycled and changed several times, the same happens with the concept of the game being space ninjas, for some time now we have stopped having space ninjas and have a completely different **** game's story and progression is horribly poorly structured especially for someone who is a new player, none of my friends are interested in playing this game and they are friends who don't know warframe and wanted to know the game, but the problem starts in another topic I was going to talk about.Game progression should be structured by limiting new players from joining high level missions and making the game more fun for those who play, not making players jump from mission to planet to planet, not forcing players to go to open worlds without knowing what they are doing in the game, the community does not oblige you but it has the role of helping those who have doubts, the game should provide general level explanations of the whole game for new players.(Warframes and Combat)I thought the new introduction of ""warframes"" characters into the game was funny, but currently I am completely against the absurd amount of warframes that most of them are not used or are completely useless and that need to take adequate buff to reach the interest of the players, which is nothing but general dmg, support, and durability in **** Warframe actually became a League Of Legends with over 50+ Warframes of them normal and enhanced prime and Umbras **** combat in general (melee, secondary and skills), the enemy npc's don't have any reaction there is no difficulty besides being authentic sponge enemies that absorb large amounts of damage and that doesn't bring any quality of life to the game.(NPC Enemys)Enemies should dodge our attacks they defend but it's not enough to bring immersiveness to combat, they should walk in groups like The Grustrag Three, there should be more varieties of enemies that are a counter to warframes, not that they give random ""One-Shot"" to players but that add difficulty to the game. But in Digital Extreme's idea to add difficulty to the game is to add +200% armor and health to enemies and nerf warframes players and weapons, excellent idea.(Nerfs and Buffs)As mentioned in the topic above I am completely against nerfs, this is because we put life time in this game to do the maximum grind to achieve good builds whether for weapons or warframes whether they are meta or not, they are timed and are nerfed for easily killing enemies , not allowing players to see enemies on the map and the problem is always the same it's not that the warframe and weapon is op, the problem is the game it's super easy and it's poorly structured if it wasn't like that then there's no reason to put DMG limits on Bosses in the game because players gave One Shot Kill on them.There have to be mechanics that enemies interact to defend against warframes, bosses should have waves of enemies, stages like we have like Vay Hek but even it continues to be bad, there could be these fights against faction bosses in open worlds that we had to invade could add that to railjack combat but it needed to be greatly improved.(Digital Extreme vs Content Creator and Community)Digital Extreme was a company with a lot of respect that was taken away from it for stopping listening to the community and just starting listening to content creator(Content creators, extremely racist, still existing in the partner program)and canceling all analyzes and negative opinions about the development of the game(Banning people from forums), making threats of banning accounts because they negatively criticize the **** a Warframe partner content creator says a Warframe needs to nerf a weapon or anything they automatically put it on the changelist, that's disgusting.(Warframe and LGBT)We have another serious problem with the warframe community, this is part of the moderation members who are completely Woke, they do not accept criticism, they do not accept opinions, they do not accept that any word is said or directed towards them, they feel in the power of superiority and the power to punish anyone who calls them into question.They continue to want to target the LGBT community, instead of being concerned with the community at large and not privileging members of the LGBT community that they sympathize with, since the fever and rise of homosexuals in society has been blamed for damaging and demolishing the video game industry.",6,10
metacritic,klkevinkl,warframe,"This game is a mess. The planetary navigation system is awful and how spread out things are makes it difficult to find group queues for anything. The combat is also weirdly ""floaty"" and you end up running long corridors or hallways where not much happens because of how quickly everything dies. The only time it feels like there's an actual fight is during the boss battles and everything else is just a long run to it. You will be doing this a lot because farming for stuff with low drop rates can take 40+ runs in some cases and you still have to spend multiple days waiting for it to be assembled in your ship.

The worst part of the game is that it seems to have some kind of automated system that flags you for everything from taking too long to clear missions to not having logged in for a long time and it forces you to message a moderator/administrator to get it resolved. If you don't, you might get banned until you do. This system is flagged as a trojan by other forms of anticheat and even some antivirus, so just be aware of what you're getting into.",4,10

This game is free. And yet it includes more content that could last you the rest of your lifetime. 50+ different warframes, 200+ weapons a lot more than 200 matter of fact I dunno many tho.

metacritic,GeneticcChimera,warframe,"Warframe is one of the free-to-play massively multiplayer online games (MMOS) that came out at the launch of the PlayStation 4 . There is no sense of cohesion -- you have to navigate the entirety of the game in the absence of a manual. Therefore, you are quickly overwhelmed. You understand as much regarding the Tenno -- an ancient and esoteric faction that you play, the synopsis of the encyclopedic story and the Warframe cosmos in the beginning as you do at the end of your playthrough.

Warframe has no sense of progression or challenge. You can experience the entirety of the game in 15 minutes -- the creators assume the psyche of quantity over quality. The gameplay is a mixed bag -- smooth acrobatic movements and swordsmanship, mediocre gunplay, repetitious cyber-ninja combat, and generic-futuristic-scenery. Nevertheless, the positives do outweigh the negatives. One enormous problem is microtransactions. Equivalent to Blacklight: Retribution, you either pay for microtransactions or commit to for an eternity in an endless system of customization, weaponry, and Warframe costumes -- though some costumes are aesthetically pleasing.",4,10
metacritic,DukeJon,warframe,"Grindy game with a great community. Lots and lots to do though it's overwhelming, for the beginner you get the tutorial quest (which is super easy) then you are thrown into all these different game mechanics. Lots of updates and freebie drops from the devs to keep everyone interested. I played this for a few weeks but got bored. You keep repeating the same levels to grind for better equipment and warframes, but the game is essentially the same. You start a level against one of the small number of enemy races. The map is often quite large and sparsely populated and it's easy to get lost, which isn't fun. You race round picking up loot. You have to perform simple minigames to turn off alarms and unlock vaults. Then you achieve your goal and head back to be extracted. Enemies are either easily killed or bullet sponges. There are a few warframes and abilities that make it too easy. Rhino is super strong. Octavia can kill rooms with a rolling disco ball. You end up wondering what the point of it all is when the weapons are all essentially the same but with different stats. There's a PvP mode but the game is geared more towards PvE.

metacritic,thethethe4,warframe,"WarFrame is a fun game, you almost fly around chopping up your enemies with a sword. You also have your special powers so that also adds to the chaotic fun of the game play. The levels do get repetitive though, each level is basically the same and all the enemies are very similar. The shear amount of micro transactions in this game is overwhelming, it has the same monetisation system as clash of clans. I understand that this is a free to play game but when you have to wait hours or even days for a simple unlock then who cares if it's free. It really slows down the game and surprise the only way to constantly keep the time down is to spend your money and that is even if you get the unlocks. To get some of the bigger more significant unlocks you have to play certain levels that give these very specific unlocks. This would be fine if you didn't have to play that same mission over and over again because each time you beat it you get one part of what ever you want and you can get the same part twice so that makes it even longer. Even this would be tolerable if it wasn't a boss fight you had to spend 30 minutes on. The game is ok and its good for a play here and there but it's not a game to obsessive over.",6,10

metacritic,MorningstarGame,warframe,"Okay so here are the fdacts as Ive come to know them.
1- Amazing Graphics and game play, when your not glitching and falling through the map floor
2- Pre New War Story Lines are interesting and smart
3-New War was not and is not worth it. about 2 and a half hours worth of Cinematic footage and unskipable blather with about 75 minutes of actual game play sprinkled in, though the sci-fi principles are actually quite sound

Now here is where it becomes less pleasant.

4- DE's idea of releasing content is Releasing poorly designed to awesomely designed new skins for existing frames, for mini cash grabs

5- DE spends more time NERFING your builds than creating new actual in game content one would assume due to the fact that they're lazy and no longer are able to slave out Rebecca, the former intern who carried them into their popularity. Rebecca for those who dont know voices the Lotus and was instrumental in the original story line to warframe.

6- Though they love to claim that they enjoy, listen and work with fan feedback, you can tell that the only fans listened to are the ones that they sponsor. And the fans they sponsor happen to be the same fans/streamers that will downplay and create excuses for glitches nerfs etc. rather than acknowledge that there's a problem to be fixed.  Seriously this need to be repeated: You will find the perfect frames for your playstyle and you will invest HOURS into perfecting your builds so that your frames play how you want them to. Then the **** nozzels at DE will nerf  your frames, mods, and builds?.

Is this all due to some people bullying others in PVP and their looking to make it more fare? NO, the crappy Conclave (their pvp battle arena) uses Conclave only mods, to Balance it out and leave it to game skills rather than your OP builds.

Is it because they need to weaken your builds because game play isn't challenging enough? Shouldn't be, their ""2nd"" star chart (map) is the exact same chart as before, just with your enemies starting out 100 levels above the normal.

So why do they do these things my honest opinion is that they have less than 0 respect for their players/fans, player/fan time and or money spent in game to try and build the MOST OP FRAMES AS POSSIBLE.

The events surrounding the game, like the Fighter's pass additions and reveals is as significant to the experience of the game as playing it, which retains the greatness of the previous entries while striking a good balance for both casual and competitive players. Yes the game has areas where it is inferior to other versions, like World of Light not being as interesting as Subspace Emissary, the Spirits not being as cool or information-focused as trophies, but the rest of the game is just so massive and loaded with content that it is more than forgivable. I believe that Smash Ultimate is as close to the series' full potential as it can possibly be, and if this is the last Smash game ever, I would honestly be fine with that.",10,10

metacritic,BroadTS,super-smash-bros-ultimate,"As of writing, I have over 1,700 hours playing this game, and I cannot stress how enjoyable of an experience it is. It's a both a party and fighting game title, where you deal damage to opponents to build up their damage, before launching them off-stage to gain points, and I've found it to be a very enjoyable experience!

Firstly, its graphics far surpass any of its predecessors, looking extremely detailed and polished, alongside classic and new sounds alike being edited perfectly for the newest instalment of the franchise. This is also one of the largest gaming crossovers of all time, with each character having an expressive move set that represents their original game despite the large roster. This also come with the possibility to play with up to 8 players at once, on stages that you can customise in the stage builder.

The game has many different things you can do, whether it be unlocking all of the characters, playing through 'Classic mode' and attempting to reach the top score of 9.9, the story mode which involves fighting your way through the corrupt fighters to take down the final bosses, Galeem and Dharkon. There are over a thousand unique spirits and custom battles to be had, with deep strategy and puzzle-solving mixed in-between. The online feature allows you to fight opponents all around the world to gain GSP (Global Smash Points) to make your way to Elite Smash, giving player an ever higher goal to reach and being a difficult but also thrilling adventure.

There are also different DLC packages that allow you to unlock new fighters such as Joker from Persona 5, Hero from Dragon Quest, and Kazuya from Tekken. These packages are not only worth he price, but also give you new stages, music tracks, spirits and a larger cast of characters to play with.

Despite its praise, the characters can feel quite unbalanced despite their move sets being expressive of their games. I found in my time playing that there are certain characters that are simply better than others in ways that can make the game unenjoyable. Ganondorf from The legend of Zelda series for example, has strong attacks but is sluggish and hard to get back onto platforms with, while characters such as Sonic the hedgehog and Steve from Minecraft are dominant for having nearly every option that Ganondorf doesn't have. This comes alongside an online experience that has its own faults, such as servers randomly shutting down, randomly being kicked out of spectating matches or there being no punishment for players who rage-quit in the middle of games.

Despite its downsides, I'd still rate this the best smash brothers game in the series and highly recommend it to you! It's absolutely worth the price and you is relatively simple and easy to get a hang of.",9,10

The characters also have stages and music tracks exclusive to the game to accompany them. The Stage Builder returns, you can use the Switch as an MP3 player??! Story Mode?? They crammed as much content as they could into this title, but kept a consistent effort to make the game high quality and relatively balanced.

Die Story hat mir persönlich wirklich sehr gefallen, es hat sogar mehr Spaß gemacht als der Subspace aus Brawl. Das Finale war wirklich schön. Auch die ganzen Cutscenes konnten mich überzeugen.
Die Hintergründe, die Charaktere und eigentlich alles von diesem Spiel ist wunderschön und detailreich gestaltet worden.
Die DLC Characters sind gut gewählt, besonders über Banjo und Kazooie habe ich mich riesig gefreut, nur habe ich Sora nicht wirklich verstehen können. Eindeutig die bessere Wahl wäre Waluigi gewesen. Aber auch die neuen Stages sowie die neu hinzugefügte Musik sind einfach nur Perfektion.

Por un lado trata de usar el tipo de combate que se uso en el juego de GameCube, el cual es el mejor de la franquicia, pero por otro lado recicla todo lo del Wii U y te deja un juego sin avance sin historia sin satisfacción por tratar de completarlo. Su campaña de aventura es realmente aburrida y repetitiva, aunque como juego de peleas es bueno no hay como que contenido extra ya que de entrada el juego te lo deja todo sin esfuerzo en cuanto lo empiezas, eso si, si quieres todo lo del juego y desbloquear todo como es costumbre hay que pagar por los personajes adicionales.

Вот, наверное, самое спорное впечатление у меня выходит: богу невозможно перепрыгнуть или сломать маленький заборчик, чтобы попасть на задание или что-то взять, какой сюр из-за этой игровой условности.. Но это было идентично и в прошлой части, просто тут этого было даже больше, что ли. Как и идентично тупая балансировка хардкора, которую я терпеть не могу. Совершенно не решили нужным это исправлять.

Цветокор иногда был ну прям вырвиглазный. Конечно, упаси Кратос, не то что было в предыдущей части (это прям скорее исключение, но очень странно это видеть, когда некоторые геймплейные сцены шедевральны на вид). Миры тут ну очень красивые из-за света и детализации, тени есть хорошие, но в некоторых красочных местах прям очень странно со светом дела обстоят: то всё очень бледно, то нереально контрастно.

Больше половины навыков, которые заново открывать, просто нужно… Куча ассетов и анимаций были взяты просто с прошлой части, что-то немного улучшено, что-то наоборот (интерфейс не особо понравился, в прошлой части мне было понятнее и приятнее в нем копаться), что-то не тронуто совсем. Понимаю, почему многие игре приписывают статус DLC, хоть и не считаю так. Головоломок больше, и они лучше — не сложные и не простые.
Насколько душные моменты в игре есть — это жесть. Я понимаю, что игра поменяла вектор, упор на сюжет и повествование, что мне в 4-й части и понравилось в целом, но как же тут этого много. Да и сражений с врагами больше, понятное дело, игра в целом значительно больше, как и наконец-то разнообразие врагов. И, о боже, куча боссов разных (хоть и снова повторяющихся). Но что не понравилось в них, так то, что в этих боях не хватает зрелищности, не хватает именно жестокости с боссами (с мобами хватает), как в старой доброй тройке. Ну, слишком игра стала сюсюканой и детской: Атрей собирает груши 2 часа.. да, в этот момент раскрывается сюжет, но это можно было сделать куда интереснее геймплейно.
Пройдя игру, осталось какое-то ну очень двоякое впечатление, и скорее перевес будет значительнее в сторону того, что мне не понравилось.

СЮЖЕТ И СПОЙЛЕРЫ
Просто какие-то нелогичные и странные мувы та повороты в сюжете. Проделать путь к Рагнареку, вызвать его, чтобы потом стараться остановить (причем не самолично даже, а закадрово…) — это так тупо, и такое разочарование вызвало. Да и вообще, чувство, что процентов 60 сюжета и геймплея — это ходить, искать пророчества, которые по сути ну не интересны. Не подвод к ним, не сами пророчества. Игру в некоторых моментах ну чересчур растягивают, и растягивают неинтересно.
В этой части я стал меньше понимать персонажей. Для меня некоторые из них действовали или говорили не так, как мне их показали. Персонажи показались вроде и не пустыми, но и что ли менее проработанными, чем в прошлой.

Краткий итог: были завышены ожидания, даже скорее и ожидания другими были в некоторых случаях. Она превосходит во всем предыдущую часть, но, наверное, всё же субъективно это, а намного больше понравилась в сюжетном плане игра 2018 года. В этой никаких слёз, мурашек от экшена, почти ничего я не испытывал, только негатив от затянутости и неинтересных миссий. Ну и ещё очень много минусов, которые можно перечислять и которые просто уже забылись.

But Kratos moves his sword and axe slowly. Some stages of the game are very boring and make the game less worth repeating or not worth repeating the game again, and even finishing the game for the first time is not so enjoyable that you can enjoy the game for hours.

metacritic,HaloFever,god-of-war-ragnarok,"A funny thing happened while playing this top tier AAA game: I stopped having fun. The main culprit is the “Soulsification” of gameplay and its emphasis on difficulty that just shuts out older and slow players or players who are stressed for time who just don’t care about getting good.          

The gameplay itself is the problem with this game. The main issue is the parry mechanic. You can no longer simply block with a shield. Every block has to be perfectly timed with an enemy attack. Time it wrong and you are worse off than not blocking. The accessibility options will let you tweak enemy damage but not increase the parry window. A longer reaction window would also help with attacks that can’t be blocked and attacks that must be counter attacked with a shield attack. The first God of War game came out in 2005. It’s long overdue for this franchise make their games accessible to an aging player base.         A minor enemy of fun in this game is the repeated backtracking to already explored areas for minor fetch quests. This is not an open world game and traversal is not fun. Some of the puzzles were not that fun either. I can see why folks like the climb anywhere mechanic in the latest Zelda games.         

That‘s enough negativity. The world, story, dialogue, and voice acting in this game are the best around. When people say they want single player games, they mean story telling and world building like this. You could take away all the combat and turn God of War into a story based game like “Detroit: Become Human”, and players would still love it.         

So all-in-all, I recommend this game with caveats. If you are a novice gamer or older gamer like myself, you might struggle to enjoy this game. With some tweaking, this could be a perfect 10/10 game. Right now, it just isn’t.",7,10

Y para mi el otro problema es que el juego te lleva siempre de la mano, ya sea con paredes escalables pintadas o bien con tu aliados casi de manera inmediata diciendote que hacer.

After completing God of War Ragnarok and its Valhalla DLC, I can confidently say that this game exceeded my expectations in every way. From the intense boss battles to the breathtaking animation and deeply emotional storytelling, Santa Monica Studio delivered an unforgettable experience that solidifies Kratos’ legacy.

Combat & Boss Battles

The battles in God of War Ragnarok are nothing short of epic. Every encounter feels weighty, tactical, and rewarding. Facing gods, beasts, and legendary warriors kept me engaged from start to finish. From the brutal confrontations with Thor and Odin to the shocking returns of Magni and Modi in Valhalla, every fight is designed to push Kratos to his limits. The DLC adds even more depth by making Kratos confront not just enemies, but his past self, leading to some of the most meaningful duels in the series.

Animation & Visuals

Visually, this game is a masterpiece. The level of detail in the environments, from the icy peaks of Midgard to the fiery ruins of Muspelheim, is breathtaking. Every animation—from Kratos’ brutal combat executions to Atreus’ swift archery—feels fluid and cinematic. Playing on PC via Steam, I was able to experience God of War Ragnarok in stunning high resolution, making every moment feel even more immersive.

Story & Character Development

What sets Ragnarok apart is its powerful storytelling. Kratos’ journey is no longer just about survival and vengeance—it’s about legacy, redemption, and change. Seeing Kratos evolve from the Ghost of Sparta into a leader and father figure willing to guide others was one of the most compelling aspects of the game. Atreus also grows significantly, forging his own path while still staying connected to his father. The introduction of new characters and the return of familiar ones, such as Sigrun and the Shield Maidens, enriches the world-building and lore.

Final Thoughts

God of War Ragnarok is more than just a game—it’s an experience. The seamless combination of action, mythology, and emotional storytelling makes it one of the greatest titles of this generation. With the Valhalla DLC, we get an even deeper dive into Kratos’ past, testing his resolve and forcing him to face the ghosts that still haunt him.

On normal difficulty. You’re kidding me.. I died so many times it became a joke. In Forspoken I felt much more like a god(ess) of war than here. Also the characters sometime talk too much, the dialogues are not particularly interesting or funny, and overall it’s the same thing over and over, very similar to previous games. If you have played the previous god of war, or games like tomb raider, uncharted, etc, you have seen it all. It’s ok if you like this type of game, but nothing stand out too much.",6,10

Gameplay: 10/10
Story: 8.5/10
Graphics: 9/10
Enjoyment: 9/10
Music: 9.5/10
Overall: 9/10

God of War: Ragnarök once again shines through with its outstanding combat, with fluid animations and finishers, it puts it above all other action games. Combine that with good world-building and storytelling, and you have an imposing cinematic action game. The puzzles are done much better in Ragnarök, they built upon the good mechanics they had in the base God of War and made the puzzles very intriguing and fun to complete. They also added more side content compared to the first game, which already had a lot.

The music and themes of the characters are done to perfection. I have a few criticisms about the story. First, the voice actor for one character I cannot mention is not great, and it really does not match his character, but instead sounds like a pre-pubescent. The cartoon villainy of some other characters is not compelling whatsoever. There are obvious and quite literally the most unneeded decisions that had nothing to add to the story. Sweet Baby Inc. worked with them near the end of Ragnarok, and it shows. And I don't know if the character development of Kratos is something I like, but we'll see how it pans out in future games.

There is something about the old-timeliness of a story, Black Myth Wukong excelled at this because it's based off a mythos from the 15th century, as too is Ragnarök which is based on an even older story from the 10th century, they did not bother to follow it, which is fine since they are bringing Kratos in, but I feel not taking from these classics does a disservice. God of War: Ragnarök feels like a modern Avengers film and doesn't have classical touch games like God of War 2016 and Wukong did. The 2018 game was amazing, but this one is a mish mash of ideas executed inadequately with much less direction. And this shouldn't surprise anyone, because they were considering making Ragnarök into two games instead of one final game for the Norse series.",9,10

metacritic,roinujoluap,god-of-war-ragnarok,"Fevereiro de 2025 - Platinado - Quero god of war

Já tinha jogado antes, fiz só o principal, mas agora vou jogar pra platinar. O gameplay de exploração ficou bem mais dinâmico, melhorando a locomoção do jogo. Gosto de ter uma interação maior com o cenário podendo congelar água e acender umas tochas, mesmo que sendo apenas as selecionadas. Demora muito pra conseguir runas de ataque magico e as primeiras são bem sem graça. Nesse jogo o machado ta bem melhor que as laminas. Tem muito mais inimigos nesse jogo. Esse jogo esta bem mais fácil do que o anterior, porem os inimigos secundários são bem mais difíceis. Em termos de gameplay, gostei de ter mais companheiros de suporte com eles usando golpes diferente.

A historia é o ponto mais fraco desse jogo. Todo mundo fica numa vibe depressiva, pedindo perdão por tudo. O Kratos numa viadagem de não querer guerra. O Atreus ta muito mais chato. O Kratos parece que é um figurante no jogo, a única vez que ele faz a historia andar é quando vai atrás das irmãs do destino e vai fazer a lança, no resto ele ta ali como guarda costas do Atreus e da Freya. Gostei muito do Heimdall, achei muito divertido ele desviando dos golpes, ele podia ter batido um pouco mais no Atreus. Não gostei desse tanto de personagem do bem que tem na historia, com a amizade entre Atreus e Thrud o jogo seguiu um caminho onde o Kratos não podia matar o Thor.

A fantastic game, it’s hard to say whether the predecessor or this one is better, both are on a very high level. The story, the characters, the atmosphere – top-notch. The soundtrack is probably the best I’ve seen in gaming. Only Hans Zimmer could compete with it in terms of epicness. The only downside is probably the first segment with Atreus and Angrboða in the Iron Woods, where we spend about 2 hours, and it’s just incredibly boring.

metacritic,Vegetti,god-of-war-ragnarok,"God of War Ragnarök foi, para mim, uma experiência incrível e envolvente do começo ao fim. Desde os primeiros momentos, senti que a narrativa seria ainda mais ambiciosa do que em seu antecessor. A relação entre Kratos e Atreus evolui de uma forma muito natural, mostrando um pai mais disposto a confiar no filho, mas ainda lutando contra seus próprios instintos protetores. Essa dinâmica é um dos pontos altos do jogo.A ambientação me impressionou bastante. Cada reino de Yggdrasil tem uma identidade visual marcante, com cenários riquíssimos em detalhes e vida. Midgard, agora congelada, traz uma atmosfera opressora, enquanto lugares como Vanaheim oferecem uma explosão de cores e natureza selvagem. A trilha sonora só intensifica essa imersão, com composições épicas que te colocam na pele de um guerreiro enfrentando desafios colossais.O combate é simplesmente espetacular. A transição fluida entre o Machado Leviatã, as Lâminas do Caos e os novos elementos trazidos ao arsenal de Kratos proporciona uma variedade tática enorme. Enfrentar inimigos com estratégias diferentes nunca fica monótono, especialmente nas lutas contra chefes — que, aliás, estão ainda mais desafiadoras e memoráveis.A história me pegou de jeito. O peso das escolhas de Kratos e a jornada de autoconhecimento de Atreus são conduzidos com maestria, abordando temas como legado, destino e redenção. Não vou dar spoilers, mas o clímax e o desfecho são emocionantes, deixando aquele gostinho de missão cumprida, mas também uma leve melancolia por saber que uma era épica pode estar chegando ao **** tivesse que destacar um ponto que me deixou um pouco frustrado, seria a linearidade de certas missões e algumas seções que pareciam um pouco esticadas sem necessidade. Ainda assim, isso é um detalhe pequeno diante do **** geral, God of War Ragnarök foi uma jornada inesquecível para mim. É o tipo de jogo que não só entrega ação visceral, mas também uma narrativa madura e tocante, provando mais uma vez que a série está no topo do mundo dos games.",10,10

metacritic,PkmnMeister,god-of-war-ragnarok,"Aside from the story and scenery, God of War has very dated gameplay. You don't feel like a god because the smallest enemies can stagger you or even kill you with just a few moves. Invisible walls and a very limited tube-like level design only emphasize it.Enemies sometimes repeat themselves from the previous part. This continues until the end. There are exceptions and interesting / well-staged opponents. Unfortunately too little and with very poor pacing, as many are repeated (**** puzzles are very limited and you sometimes have to do exactly what the developers ask you to do, even if that's exactly how you thought it out, but you don't act with pixel precision. It also takes you more out of the game. It feels like a pattern. Hordes of enemies, hose passages and then monotonous puzzles. If you want to immerse yourself in the story, the unnecessary RPG nonsense will get you out of it. Equipping may be a little improved from the first part, but it's still too much. Like the combat system with the camera problems and the question of whether it should be Hack'nSlay or more tactical Souls-like, the entire game doesn't really know what it wants to be. It was like torture for me until the end. Motivated by the good scenery mentioned at the beginning, the interesting characters and the story. But to get to these points, I have to deal with outdated gameplay that offers poor pacing. It is one of the worst games I have played in 2024.I wish the combat system had been made more fun, short-winded, and freer. Without RPG elements, or really just a minimum of new armor parts. Skill unlocking would also have been nice to be able to happen automatically (and intuitively). Almost everything is ripped out. I would have liked more individuality and variety in the opponents. And when you fight against crowds, please do so in a way that makes you feel like a god (quickly and well staged). And don't laboriously process every hundredth opponent like a stronger one. The strengths were this hidden world, where you later go with Artreus. Epically staged boss fights (not the annoying little bosses), the visual environments (not hose levels), such as on the way to Odin, and the characters in general. 6.2",6,10

I used to play Hearthstone several years ago occasionally and quit because I got bored of it and annoyed by the constant push for new cards and packs and so on.
Now I booted the game up again today for a couple of matches. All my old decks were useless because most of the cards are either gone or disabled for standard matches. So I went through the horrendous menus while constantly having the screen orgasm at me about achievement this and new unlock that (I had no idea what most of it even is). After going through all this nonsense I then wanted to get a feel for the game again to see cards and playstyle and so on. I had no idea what cards to use for a deck so I went with one of the 6 premade ""loan"" decks where supposedly you can keep of them at the end of a certain time period. I tried several of them and play about 10 matches.

I lost every single one of them on the lowest rank and it wasn't me making mistakes. I simply had no chance with the deck because whatever these other players had always literally obliterated me. And a lot of times I didn't even understand what moves my opponents made. I saw mages use his 1 damage class ability mini fireball that killed a minion that had 2 hp. I have no idea how that worked. The log didn't show anything special. It just died. There's also way to many weird effects jump all over the screen and are difficult to keep track off while you're under constant time pressure to make your moves.

I have no idea what kind of players enjoy Hearthstone at this point but I can't imagine it's anyone doing it for casual fun. The UI is messy and the gameplay is terrible. Not much else to say.",1,10

- brilliant tavern music
- many beautiful arts

- gameplay is often unbalanced
- many new cards added but lack of new mechanics so the freshness of gameplay is unsatisfying
- relatively high entry threshold (in Standard)

- lack of basic function as in game deck tracker, graveyard, detailed statistics/progress, one-click unhooking (open all packs button etc.)
- lots of bugs and problems with fixing them

Also too much ""randomness"" for a game that claims to be competitive: Luck beats skill in  100 of 100 matches where this could be the deciding factor. Of course people get angry for it and they try to direct their anger to the only vent they have: the enemy player - reasonable, since winning enemies are not free of guilt. But Blizzard completly disabled chat for non-friends - which is by far the most crucial mistake for a multiplayer game. You would think that Blizzard is into the Online-gaming business long enough to know that ""Toxicity and flame always finds a way"" - if not by chat then by emotes, or abusing the items in game they have.

metacritic,ElleSeeWhy,hearthstone-heroes-of-warcraft,"Hearthstone's tagline: Deceptively simple, insanely fun is very descriptive of the kind of game that Blizzard set out to make and in many ways did succeed to make.

At it's core, hearthstone mechanics is easy to grasp, but the skill ceiling of the game is pushed much higher by decks with intricate combos and game plans. In hearthstone, I have always leaned towards combo oriented decks and it has always been super satisfying to pull out complex combos and crush my opponent's face.

However, having played for years, I have to give HS a negative review. Firstly, the monetisation of this game is extremely greedy compared to many other games. The card packs are priced at close to the cost of TCG's physical cards when the value of virtual cards are nowhere close to that of physical cards. The simplest example to highlight HS's greedy monetisation, the preorder bundle for the upcoming expansion costs 80USD and does not provide even half of the full content of the expansion.

Another thing that has really bugged me playing this game over the years is how Blizzard have always been slow to react to community feedback about balance and QoL changes. The community had to beg for months just to have additional deck slots.

Also, it is simply embarrassing that a gaming company as storied as Blizzard is still unable to provide simple features like replay functionality even 6 years after the game's launch. It is also indicative of Blizzard's greed that the battleground's statistic page is priced behind the 20USD battlegrounds perks. I could buy several indie games for the same price, and all I get from the 20USD perks, is a statistic page, ability to use emoticons and the ability to choose from 2 more characters which is strictly speaking, p2w.",0,10

metacritic,AdAstraMadCat,hearthstone-heroes-of-warcraft,"This game was fun and interactive when it came out, however, expansions totally killed its magic. Developers decided to add imbalanced cards and use them to force players into playing expansion-specific deck archetypes. Any element of fun just got lost, the game is no more decided by skillful play and careful consideration of opponents deck, but merely by draw luck, as cards and their specific combinations are so strong that one card drawn card can basically kill an opponent on its own.

It doesn't pay off to create a unique deck and surprise opponents with non-standard cards, because the difference in cards' power-level dictates what cards can you play to be successful.

In other words: I really enjoyed the game up to the expansion Journey to Un'Goro, but afterward, it became an unfocused mess. In my opinion, it's not worth getting into at this point.

Battlegrounds is a fun mode, but super luck dependent, and the Arena suffers from the same issues as competitive: snowball effect can kill you without having a chance to react.

Update: problems of luck and hyper-powerful cards are increasing every expansion. Your skill and experience don't matter in the slightest.

metacritic,Caeruleus_CCXVI,pokemon-tcg-pocket,"5/10 - The Definition of average to me

---This game is just fine, a watered down version of the original Pokemon TCG, not unlike YGO Duel links or LoL Wild rift. This Version of Pokemon TCG is more in line with other digital games like marvel snap, hearth stone, etc. I do enjoy that this will be many 1st time exsperiance with playing pokemon or even card games, and the general genre is a very slowly dying bread of game that needs much new blood in the industry.

---I was away on a long trip during the initial release with very poor internet connection so I didnt bother even trying to play the game. Only starting 3 or so weeks after the games release,  I noticed a dip in launch rewards and exclusive cards that will surely bite me in the butt later. 

---I am a long time player of card games, pokemon included. And having something to keep me vaguely in the scope of all things pokemon and something to do during breaks of my life is nice. This game is truly a 20 or so minute game, and an embodiment of what a mobile game is suppose to be.

---All that being said, this game is just fine and a score of 5/10 should reflect this. Seeing a 7ish/10 score from both user and meta score means my opinion is probably spot on as 6.5-7.5/10 is average these days.",5,10

Ich kann die negativen kritiken nur minimal verstehen, die leute sollten sich ein anderes franchise suchen. Was die von pokemon erwarten ist totaler käse. Abwechslungreiches gameplay, tolle story, etliche pokemon mehr usw xD sry, das ist absoluter quatsch. Bei pokemon gings immer darumden pokedex zu vervollständigen. In diesem spiel hat man das sogar verbessert indem man die pokemon mehrfach fangen muss, aufgaben abbarbeiten kann usw dadurch fängt man nicht einfach jedes pokemon und lässt es auf der box versauern, sondern man kämpft mit so gut wie jedem pokemon. Absolut geil. Klar, für manche wirkt das langweilig, aber keine ahnung was die leute sich dabei denken, was die für spiele wollen. Ich bin bei 150 stunden und noch lange nicht durch. Und das schlimmste, ist das grafik rumgeheule. Ich kanns echt nicht verstehen. Was erwartet man denn von einer switch? Nintendo war noch nie ein herrsteller der groß auf leistung gesetzt hat. Und leistung ist nebensächlich, wenn der spielspaß im vordergrund steht. Vor allem, worauf die leute achten. Bäume, steine usw. Ich achte aufso etwas gar nicht, ich achte auf die pokemon. Genauso wie lebende städte. In welchem pokemon spiel gabs das denn? Die meisten städte waren klein, es gab ne handvoll npcs und das wars xD was verglichen wird ist so heftiger nostalgiewert, das macht gar keinen sinn. Dann lasst das franchise liegen, vielen spielern zu denen ich auch gehöre macht es mega spaß.

metacritic,ArdeniC,pokemon-legends-arceus,"Having seen many positive reviews and the generally favorable user/critic scores for the game, I decided to try it out. I'm familiar to the Pokémon franchise from my childhood but I've only played Pokémon Sword before. Pokémon sword was a letdown with its repetitive mechanics but I had fun catching familiar Pokémon for nostalgia reasons. I thought that Arceus would be something different and that it would have more challenging mechanics and an interesting story.

Here are my issues:
- The main story has potential, but it is very predictable and the characters are totally unconvincing, irrational and robotic. The writing is simply bad even though the setting shows promise.
- The graphics are abysmal, it was unplayable on a large screen so I played almost the whole game in handheld mode. 
- The music was all right (not great by any means) but the sound effects are terrible - especially for the Pokémon themselves. The Pokémon have generic, metallic sounding voices, the same sound plays for all Pokémon when they ""speak"". Only the pitch changes a bit. The sound was very unpleasant to hear in any case.
- The combat is boring, way too easy and repetitive. The Pokémon battles are similar to the previous game and I didn't mind them, but the boss fights had terrible mechanics and the only challenge they may have posed was due to poorly implemented mechanics.
- Catching Pokémon by aiming with pokéballs was fun at first but became very repetitive rather quickly. The variance of Pokémon in different areas was not very good so I ended up seeing a lot of the same Pokémon in many places.

All in all, I can't understand why this game has so positive reviews. I ended up playing for about 25 hours to finish the main story and collect some familiar Pokémon. There are pretty much no redeeming qualities aside from the (personally) nostalgic Pokémon theme and the fragment of a story which could have been interesting save for the terribly written, unbelievable characters. These are the only reasons for me not to give a 0 to the game, what a waste of time and money.",1,10

metacritic,Germano166,pokemon-legends-arceus,"A masterpiece!

Story and Characters
Plot Summary: 
Arceus transports the player back in time,dropping them into the Hisui region (later known as Sinnoh). As a recent settler, you join the Galaxy Expedition Team’s Survey Corps and become both a symbol of hope and fear.
Engagement:
 the story was okay there was no gym battles but souls like boss battle which was very fun to do and our character does not represent what do i want so many times it is a childs game and little bit of adult game at the same time.
Gameplay
Core Mechanics:
Open-World Real-Time Pokémon Encounters & Capturing rpg with crafting and soulslike boss battles.
Controls:
Controls were very responsive, using all the Joy-Con buttons effectively.
Difficulty Level: 7/10 - Difficult enough for a Pokémon game meant for kids.
Graphics & Sound
Graphics Quality: graphics is generally good? you dont leave snowpath when walking on snow most of the things and textures load when you are close to it etc... but it was good generally
Art Style: art style is damn good i think this is the best art style on pokemon game history
Soundtrack & Voice: soundtracks were damn so good they made it well in this game too as always general voice were really good but there is no sound coming from pokemons it is same sounds for all of them. I think we should have voice acting in 2024 by this moment i dont know if it is cartuge's problem but voice acting would be good

Catching pokemon has never been this interactive and fun. The battles are short, but still give you a good fill. And the world yet a bit boring is large, expansive and worth exploring.

metacritic,ThatProGamer,pokemon-legends-arceus,"Honestly, Sinnoh needed this Diamond and Pearl was so bad that it made me drop the Pokémon franchise until Pokémon X and Y, or was it Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire. Regardless it wasn't until around that time that I returned to the Pokémon franchise. Yeah, I missed Black and White so there's that.

Pokémon Legend Arceus really does an amazing job at making Sinnoh, known as Hisui in that time period seem interesting. The battle mechanic is fresh and brings a new level of strategy to the franchise. Also, you can opt to catch Pokémon without battling them. Something, I'll admit, I wish Scarlet and Violet had. I also like how the Pokedex is structured.

The Pokedex itself is less of a side venture and more of a key aspect that gives the player incentive to explore the world and interact with it. Far more than you do in Breath of the Wild. Funny, I'm finding a lot of games making open world Zelda seem like a joke.

But I digress the Pokedex acts a means to have the player explore and interact with the world. The crafting system also gives the player incentive to interact with ore chunks and aprcot and berry trees. This game really shows us what an open world game should strive for. A world that we the players actively engage with.

I also love the storyline, not quite on point with Scarlet/Violet's storytelling but it's still pretty good. Overall great game and I highly recommend it. That is if you can look past fps stuff, which, in my opinion people are far too picky about that these days.",8,10
metacritic,rat233,pokemon-legends-arceus,"The combat system of Pokemon Legends: Arceus is very different from previous Pokémon games. You won't be forcibly dragged into battle by wild Pokémon's crash like before. Instead, you may get killed by brutal wild Pokémon if you are too close to them. Further more, boss battle in Arceus is also very different, you have to watch the boss's moves and keep dodging until the boss is tired so you can use your own Pokémons to battle with it. To get higher level Pokémon listen to your commands, you'll have to complete quests, which means capturing and battling the same kinds of Pokémon over and over again. This process can be repetitive and boring.",6,10

metacritic,Ventu,pokemon-legends-arceus,"Pokemon Legends: Arceus es una nueva propuesta de juego dentro del universo Pokémon, y me ha encantado. Hacía muchas entregas que no disfrutaba tanto con un juego de la franquicia. Poner el foco en coleccionar y completar la pokédex me parece un acierto, aunque la historia peque un poco de simple, esto ya es algo habitual en la franquicia. Las nuevas mecánicas de captura y de mundo semiabierto le sientan genial. A pesar de que la propuesta me parece un avance total en la franquicia, hay cosas que mejorar, como la riqueza del mundo, tanto a nivel de diseño como de variedad, o el apartado técnico, que sin ser malo, sigue siendo un poco el punto débil de Gamefreak. Si te gusta la franquicia, totalmente recomendable esta nueva propuesta que esperemos marque el futuro de la saga.",9,10

metacritic,Nintenblue,pokemon-legends-arceus,"Pokemon Legends Arceus is undoubtedly a game with its own unique charm and standout features. The game's captivating narrative, accompanied by immersive music and environments, stands out as its strongest aspect. However, its gameplay may be considered its weakest side.

In an attempt to revamp the traditional Pokemon formula, the game has simplified the mechanics and reduced the required skill. As a consequence, battles feel not as engaging and interesting as they would have been with a more traditional approach.

Additionally, beyond exploration, the game offers relatively limited content. While efforts were made to introduce challenging post-game activities, they may not have been sufficient. The interactions with the environment also lack polish, resulting in some tedious aspects in the open-world navigation.

Furthermore, the game's menus could have been more ergonomic, and the button mapping more intuitive.

Despite these flaws, the overall gaming experience is enjoyable, and I appreciate the time spent playing it. While not without imperfections, they are certainly manageable.

Pokemon Legends Arceus represents an admirable attempt to innovate within the franchise, and I commend Game Freak for exploring new ideas through this spin-off title. Their experience gained from this endeavor will undoubtedly help the development of future mainline games.",8,10

And Now Finally he remembers and is so angry that he needs do write down his infinite Anger and hate!

Legend Arceus is a bad game because nothing of the nice Pokemon Formula is in this game, nor Arena, no online PVP, no nice Roundbased good old fashioned tactical strategic Combat (what this combat is is a mere bad baked clone of what it is in the main series).
It is acatching simulator designed for stuipid 3 IQ Liveforms that only can think about catching the next 30 random Pokemon for a Quest that gives you nothing! 
The "" dark souls like - Boss fights "" are a big Joke - Yeah its Pokemon its ok that you dont have weapons and throw ""Food"" ****"" or ""whatever"" but this fights are so generic and bad designed.

metacritic,Gimrikk,pokemon-legends-arceus,"Pokemon Legends: Arceus is easily the best Pokemon game to come out in years. While my initial impression was somewhat negative after seeing the new open world and de-emphasized battle mechanics, I can 100% say it worked perfectly. The open world while not super detailed in graphics makes up for it with how densely packed with Pokemon it is. This is the first game in a long time that completing the Pokedex feels attainable while being fun for once. While the battling is a little janky at times with camera angles and some slight lag spikes it is hardly a problem. The new catching mechanic without battling incorporated the different Pokeball types and stealth gameplay perfectly. Allowing for a new and many times better approach to dealing with Pokemon in the wild. Paired with the great approach of using starters from 3 different regions in Hisuian form, the new quest system made for an extremely enjoyable playthrough. Overall this game was a fresh entry in the Pokemon franchise that was easily the most fun out of the last few entries. Looking forward to my next playthrough of it",9,10
metacritic,Fricka,pokemon-legends-arceus,"Compared to the standard of more recent Pokemon games, this game is fantastic. As a game in general, though, it is alright. When I boot up this game, it oozes of charm and feels so comforting, from its music, to its art direction and main town. The gameplay loop is generally quite engaging for the first 10-20 hours or so, but due to the loop being quite underdeveloped, it eventually becomes quite boring around the halfway mark. The story is also quite atrocious, not because the plot in and of itself is bad conceptually, but because of the execution. There is SO much dialogue and the story just drags on and on and on. The dialogue feels bloated in size and takes up way too much time than it deserves, especially noticeable in how the game requires 2 HOURS for the game to begin and you finally gain control over your character and are free to explore. I was not interested at any point. A lot of the characters also feel overdesigned, with me having absolute no interest or attachment with any of them. The game does feel like it had more love and effort put into it than games like Sword/Shield or Scarlet/Violet but the bar is extremely low, meaning that the addition of more varied face animations feels really pathetic when compared to other games with considerably less budget and attention. It's like you go to a restaurant that serves a dish with really bad presentation. Then, on the Thursday when the owner's cousin is running the shop, they put some few sprinkles of herbs on top, although it isn't very much, but is only done to appease complaints to the real owner's practices. Meanwhile, the competing restaurant next door has the presentation out of this world. This is what Legends Arceus feels like. Compared to their cousin, the owner (aka the main Pokemon devs), Legends Arceus is better, but compared to any one else in the industry, they are objectively worse and almost archaic in how behind they are on common standards for quality.",6,10

metacritic,dziubus1234,tetris-effect,"I bought the game primarily for the online multiplayer and it proved to be a huge let down. First of all, it's usually pretty difficult to find somebody to play with, sopmetimes you have to wait for a few minutes to find another player. And then it's usually a handful of the same players that you get. Second of all, from the few players out there, a greta majority if very experienced and so it's really difficult to score any points at all as a new player whop's just learning. And the game offers no balancing system, where it would match you with players with similar seniority only. Third of all, the scoring system is very unbalanced. You gain few point when winning, but lose a lot in case of a loss. It's pretty demotivating. Overall, I don't enjoy this game.",0,10
metacritic,SamJBarn,tetris-effect,"To an extent, someone's enjoyment of Tetris Effect over other entries will be heavily influenced by their enjoyment of the music, which is sometimes surprisingly poppy. However, even as someone who doesn't often listen to this type of music, I found myself extremely enamored give or take a couple songs. In fact, I often listen to the soundtrack on Spotify while I work - it's great for focus and pep, considering the whole idea of the game is to lean into the deep concentration many already experience when playing standard Tetris.

Music aside, I think most will agree that the lavish, particle-filled visuals and evocative backgrounds are wonderful. Fans of Rez, Lumines and other games of its kind will find that same vibe paired very well with the classic Tetris mechanics.

My only gripe is that the modes feel a bit sparse - I would have liked more options for simple customization, such as being able to set up revolving playlists of my favorite songs. Overall, though, this is one of my favorite versions of Tetris if only because it uses its presentation to induce the euphoric hyper-focus that makes me seek out a game like this in the first place.",8,10
metacritic,RatchetClank111,tetris-effect,"Tetris Effect takes it to a whole new level. I always thought tetris has good music, but this game has great music. The story mode features various level designs, with songs to match each level.

Pros
This creates a dynamic environment and you really feel like you are progressing through an adventure, which concludes with a final level with an amazing soundtrack and blends so many beautiful backgrounds and lights and sound effects.
-The controls are great on the PS controller
-Many different game modes
-Offers leaderboard scores and events

Cons
Some of the design layouts and effects actually hurt my eyes and can be rather distracting, but I would only say that's a few of the themes, most of the levels are solid.

In terms of gameplay the only real addition is the ‘zone mode’, which allows players to freeze time and fill multiple lines at once, and adds a new level of strategy to the game.

Where Tetris Effect really shines however is when played in VR. The music and graphical touches, that react in response to the players actions, are simply mesmerizing and it’s difficult to describe the experience. If you’re a Tetris fan this is a fairly fun iteration, but if you have PSVR, it’s a must buy!",9,10

El unico problema es el precio, 40 dolares por un tetris, si tendra VR y sera el Tetris mas loco que vas a jugar en tu vida, pero no deja de ser un Tetris, ahora se actualizo y agrego un modo multijugador pero de todas formas sigue siendo caro, por lo que es.",8,10
metacritic,Shenandoah,tetris-effect,"This classic retro game makes a lot of fun to play in VR. The music and sound concept is really good, but the visuals did not reach this quality. The tetris bricks looks blurry and has bad antialiasing, it also looks like there is no PS4 Pro enhanced support to push a higher resolution. For such a simple 3D scene it could be a lot better, by sure!

All in all it is a mediocre game, the experience in VR is nice but nothing more on these days. I did not understand the hype, because it isn’t one of the best games for PSVR, at least not in 2020. The most fun comes from the Tetris gameplay itself, which we know already since 25 years. For this reason it is also heavily overpriced.

So here I am, starting the more acclaimed Tetris for a long time now, and after a short time I land on Da Vinci Stage, suddenly the game has a speed up following the old has-been trans goa music, and yet it is almost impossible to put a simple bloc in the right place, it's makes me think ok it's already the end of it.

I'm not sure how anyone with a heart and an interest in puzzle games could not fall in love with this game.

It's the best Tetris ever made. Tetris never needs to be remade again after this.

The soundtrack in Journey mode literally brought me to tears. Play this game on Journey mode with a powerful surround sound system for epic emotional experience.

This is one of my favorite ten games of all time. Endlessly replayable and absolutely the most emotionally satisfying puzzle game of all time. I have cried many times playing this game... but then I'm playing it at reference volume with Pioneer Elite THX Ultra receiver and a bi-amped Klipsch 5.1 system.

I think that the negative reviewers might not have a good enough audio system to really see the beauty of this game.

Look... just give it a shot. And start by playing the game this way:

Play Journey mode on beginner, regardless of how good you are, and do not stop playing it until you beat the game. Set aside a couple hours or more if you're not good, and do it only when you can have the volume cranked.

Do this and you'll be floored.

Seriously... I never thought a puzzle game could make me cry multiple times, but I was literally balling when I finally beat the last level on expert mode... which took a long time for me to be able to do.

One of the best games of all time. The music is absolutely fantastic and unforgettably mixed into the way the game is played. Stunning.

metacritic,JakeBomb,tetris-effect,"While Tetris Effect is a beautiful game, a game it feels like I’ve waited my whole life to play—it’s plagued by the very thing that makes it fun: the audio visualizations. If you play Tetris Effect you’ll notice that when moving your tetraminos, a little sound plays to the beat. This is a lot of fun if you play the game to the beat of the music, but if you want to play Tetris as fast as possible the sound cue will slow you down or mess up your accuracy. There’s a solution to this, and it’s called turning the volume off on the game—but then, you don’t get to enjoy the reason you just spent $40 on a Tetris game, and you’re just playing Tetris with a controller which is objectively worse than mouse and keyboard for pin point accuracy.

The other issue is that when you level up to the next stage, the beat (or time signature, if we want to get musical) does not consistently transition into the next time signature, it’s very abrupt and jarring and often happens out of sync. For a game that is trying to immerse you in its music and visuals, it shouldn’t be that hard to program loading times between levels to finish a time signature accurately before starting the next one.

The biggest problem with Tetris Effect is that the most efficient way to play it is with the volume off, screen zoomed in and the “effect” turned to minimum brightness. Which is just normal Tetris. And it’s a damn shame too, since playing with the music is a lot of fun but it feels like exactly what the title suggests: its an “Effect.” The sounds and music should be aiding you in this game, but instead they work against you. You don’t get rewarded for playing to the rhythm, which in a music game is RIDICULOUS. No score bonus, quickly placing a tetramino to the beat doesn’t give you a little extra time on the next piece, and pieces fall onto the board out of tempo.

We could also mention that this is a $40 Tetris game with:
- No Online Multiplayer
- No Mouse/Keyboard Support
- All buttons must be configured even buttons you don’t need to use like camera movement
- The right stick has a turn camera that can not be reconfigured. Why would you need to turn your camera in Tetris?

This game is a shallow disappointment. All flair and no substance. Smoke and mirrors. An illusive trick.

I hope Tetris Effect 2, if it even comes out, handles some of these complaints. Even better, they could patch the game to address these issues. Otherwise this game’s difficulty and challenge is just an “effect.”",3,10

I don’t see the hype
Tetris Effect is your standard Tetris game, but there’s an added element of music and visuals…
Don’t get me wrong, this game is beautiful and I love the musical elements, but I didn’t find this to be a mind blowing iteration for Tetris… but please keep in mind I played this game as is, without PlayStation vr…
that being said Tetris Effect is easily my favorite Tetris game…
there are multiple modes, campaign which can take around 3 to 4 hours to complete with multiple difficulty choices as well as an online mode where you can chase scores, just zen out and play Tetris with no game overs.. plenty of variety…
I’m more of a campaign guy, so that’s where I stayed and I wasn’t that  impressed…
The game tricks you by giving you the best level from the jump…
the first song is literally the only song in the entire game I cared for.. making me wish they went the rout of licensing music instead of just having originals, the lack of care for the music kind of dampened the experience for me… I was just out of it… focused on the puzzle of tetris while there was noise in the background, except for of course the very first level, I was immersed with the music, the gorgeous visuals in the background…
I was so excited to see what more this campaign had to blow me away and it just never came…
All in all if you love or enjoy tetris I highly recommend you pick tetris effect up, again its my favorite tetris game to date, but if you’ve never really been into it, theres not enough done here for me to really urge you to give it another shot.. its tetris with modern rules.

metacritic,bersi84,tetris-effect,"Tetris Effect is a visual audio experience that is extraordinary but misses a few spots to reach perfection. For the regular price tag I want to give it a 7 but as I had really fun with it I decided to give it an 8.

Tetris Effect features the old-school Tetris experience combined with many other game modes such as such surprise stages, multi-stages, time attacks, marathon and many more. The core is the ""journey"" where you travel through (20?) different levels with dynamic themed musics and extraordinary graphical support in 4K HDR. Even without PSVR this game features an outstanding game experience. If you like Tetris as a game I highly suggest to get Tetris Effect.

The gameplay is easy and fluent. Tutorial is at hand for newer people. You can unlock numerous avatars, soundtracks and more. There must be around 10-15 game modes all with minimal differences but they add up to a meaningful Tetris experience.

Although game-play, visuals and audio are superb the game lacks a few things:

- There is no multiplayer at all. I think this is a huge missed out opportunity. I m mostly on single player only games but Tetris can be really fun versus others. So this decision makes me a little bit sad.
- Some of the visuals block the screen, which is really bothersome when you face levels at speed  10+. In my honest opinion, they SHOULD be fixed because it hurts the game-play experience which should come first before visuals.
- The core journey is very short, which is really sad because it is an awesome experience. On normal it took me around an hour to finish which is way too short for the price tag it is sold at. If they would ve double or tripled the size with considerable stage differences the game experience would ve been insane.

I want to give this game a 10 because it is awesome but the price tag does not fit. I would suggest to get it at a sale of at least 50%. For this price tag I would probably give it a 8.5 to 9. Still the missed multiplayer opportunity and some visual blockage wont make this a 10 for me. Overall I really like this game and it is a worthwhile experience coming back to Tetris after so many years.",8,10
metacritic,titten,tetris-effect,"It's a damn good Tetris game except for:
1. No multiplayer - Not even local - This is a big one.
2. There's no way to turn off the particle effects, which can be bothersome.

PSVR gives the game very low latency (16ms) and this is the best way to experience it.

With that being said; this game completely drops the ball with everything else. Firstly they gave up what everyone wanted to see, which was the expansion of the relationship between the two main characters Joel, and Ellie, and was replaced it with a revenge/acceptance plot, using a character that's forced onto the player. Even that, Part 2 doesn't even do in a way to put the player on board with what's being told. Main characters will make appalling decisions for what feels like no reason, side characters lack any traits to make you care about them, and feel like dull, cardboard cut-outs of real people, in terms of the way they act. This game in the end took an unnecessary risk of narrative shift, and structure that doesn't pay off, no matter what way you try to cut it. It's abhorrent. To sum things up: You play a husk ****, that gives you a story you will either entirely disagree with, or just not care about to begin. I genuinely hope there is no part 3.",3,10

metacritic,Kewall,the-last-of-us-part-ii,"While this game boasts incredible visuals, detailed animations, and intense action sequences, I found myself conflicted about the overall experience. The storyline is where it fell short for me. Character deaths often felt unnecessary, and many of the protagonists made decisions that were difficult to relate to, which ultimately made it hard to connect with or care about their outcomes.Narrative direction aside, I also felt that some themes were overemphasized in a way that disrupted immersion. I have no issue with the inclusion of diverse characters, including LGBTQ+ representation, but at times it seemed forced or overly prevalent, particularly in emotional scenes that already struggled with subtlety. Characters like Ellie and the addition of Lilly, a trans character, could have added depth, but their arcs occasionally felt more like messaging than organic storytelling.Furthermore, the portrayal of nearly every female character with some form of emotional instability or trauma felt unbalanced and, at times, **** the end, while I appreciated the technical mastery of the game, the narrative left me feeling detached. For players more interested in cohesive and grounded storytelling, this installment might not resonate.

metacritic,davidthesloth,the-last-of-us-part-ii,"Simply an amazing game. While it doesn't live up to the first game, there's a lot that Part II does to innovate and improve upon the previous entry. I really like how the Part II humanises the enemies in the game and that it's not just a massacre of generic grunts. This is also emphasised when you kill an enemy, one of their comrades will shout their name is despair, which is such a lovely touch. Speaking of details, the environments are absolutely stellar. Overgrown vegetation, buildings and combat areas are amazingly designed and are often dense and detailed. Genuinely so many awe inspiring moments, the Devs really deserve all the praise they get. I've never seen a game look so good. The story is gut wrenching. While I think the overall narrative is quite weak and ultimately nonsensical, the characters however are incredibly well written and I was emotionally invested in every main character. Every companion that accompanies you never feels like a nuisance or, more importantly, doesn't constantly yap or tell you where to go. I ended up really liking Abby's character the most. Very strong character (literally) and definitely had the best parts in the game (the hotel, the hospital, the island) and her relationship with Lev is also very endearing. Performances from all the cast are incredible. The amount of range these actors display for this game is almost god-like. Combat is much better than the first and really like how varied it is. I appreciate the lack of yellow/white paint and hand holding of the player's hand in general. Platforming/Traversal is good but the jumping mechanic is janky af. Deaths and jumps scares really come out of nowhere which really made me feel uneasy and tense. Also props to the Devs for the inclusion of various accessibility options. Minor nit picks include, structure collapse ex-machina, Owen and Mel being such weak and annoying characters and holy hell those load times are BAD. I could be waiting up to a minute, sometimes more, after skipping a cutscene or reload a checkpoint, all the while this was running on a PS5 Pro.

The gameplay was clunky and shots didn't feel weighty enough, and everything in here has just... been done before somewhere else. It's a fine game, even a good one, you won't find me claiming otherwise, but I just don't see the mind-blowing masterpiece everyone else seems to, and I genuinely don't understand the reputation this still has to this day. Have people just not played enough other games? The graphics were stunning at release (I remember at the time saying it was the most realistic-looking game I'd ever seen), characters are relatively believable as people, the acting is brilliant. As a video game, though, it's a strong ""meh"", and the more it's lauded as the best of all time the more resentful I grow toward it.

j'ai vu des personnes de mon entourage s'intéresser soudainement à des jeux vidéos ou pour d'autres qui jouent déjà, à se pencher beaucoup plus à des solo narratifs et sortir un peu de leur zone de confort multijoueur et compétitif. à partir du moment ou ton projet intéresse une cible/communauté supplémentaire qui n'a rien à voir avec tes attentes c'est qu'il est clairement réussi.",10,10

It tries too hard to be a movie, which results in a lack of gameplay. The levels are basically corridor-like rectangles and squares with overly detailed environments, making looting a chore. The way back is magically sealed off very often, which can be annoying when you're looking for a secret room. There's no option to turn off the adaptive difficulty, and the game lowers the enemy count very quickly after deaths. The environmental puzzles are too easy, repetitive, and can feel unnecessary. The story and characters are good. The combat and stealth mechanics are definitely the best part of the game, and can be a lot of fun.",5,10

metacritic,fu_fighter,the-last-of-us,"The Last of Us for PS3 has often been hailed as a masterpiece, but after attwmpts at playing through this game, I found it to be a largely overrated experience. What should have been an engaging post-apocalyptic journey felt like a predictable slog, with little to keep me invested beyond the surface-level plot.

One of the major problems is how the game leans into standard apocalyptic tropes without bringing anything fresh to the table. The world is overrun by infected, civilization has collapsed, and survivors have turned into ruthless scavengers. It's the same setup we've seen countless times before, and The Last of Us doesn't do much to elevate it beyond that.

Additionally, the AI in the game is frustratingly predictable and, frankly, dumb. Enemies and allies alike often act in absurd ways. Whether it’s companions loudly running around without consequence or enemies getting stuck in basic patterns, the AI lacks the intelligence needed to make encounters feel tense or challenging. This predictability makes stealth and combat feel more like a chore than a thrilling survival experience.

As for the gameplay itself, it’s a slow burn that borders on boring, so much so that it took me 6 attempts to complete this game as I would give up due to boredom (I fell asleep during gameplay during one attempt). The pacing drags, especially during long stretches of exploration where there’s little to do but walk around dilapidated environments. The moments of action are often too spread out, leaving a lot of downtime that feels padded just to stretch out the playtime.

Overall, while The Last of Us does feature decent visuals and a solid emotional narrative, the actual experience was underwhelming. The predictable story, repetitive combat, and uninspired AI make it hard to justify the high praise.",4,10

metacritic,Svjatomir,the-last-of-us,"Released in 2013, ""The Last of Us"" isn't just a video game; it's a masterpiece that was far ahead of its time and remains a benchmark for narrative depth and emotional storytelling in the gaming industry. At a time when many games were still focusing on action-packed sequences and straightforward plots, ""The Last of Us"" brought an unexpected and impressive level of depth to the action-adventure **** story of Ellie and Joel is gripping, heart-wrenching, and unforgettable. From their first encounter to the final scene, the game takes players on an emotional journey that goes far beyond what one would expect from a video game. It's the portrayal of humanity in a post-apocalyptic world that makes ""The Last of Us"" so unique. The relationship between the two main characters develops authentically and touchingly as they navigate through a ruined and dangerous world.What sets this game apart is the way it captures mood and atmosphere. Every environment, every detail of the decimated cities, and every sound in the derelict buildings contributes to the oppressive yet captivating atmosphere. Often, players feel lonely, depressed, and hopeless—but this is precisely what makes the experience so intense and engaging.Another aspect that elevates ""The Last of Us"" above other games of its time is the unwavering tension. Despite the relatively slow-paced narrative and moments of calm, the game never becomes boring. The story unfolds with a steady but compelling rhythm that continually drives the player forward. Every moment feels significant, every encounter with other survivors or infected is a new challenge that emotionally involves the player and often pushes them to their moral limits.Overall, ""The Last of Us"" is a groundbreaking game that, through its complex, emotional story and perfectly captured atmosphere, not only surpasses other games of its era but also stands today as one of the most outstanding and influential works in video game history. It is an experience that lingers—a journey shared with Ellie and Joel that stays with you long after the game is over.",10,10

Special mention for the OST and sounds, Gustavo Santaolalla is such and incredible artist, and fortunately he found the right opera to canalize his art into.
This is a game that start and finish in a way that could be stand alone, and still be a magnificent product, but ironically, because Part 2 is so unbelievably unreachable, you could take this one as just an introduction, because the real magic happens in Part 2.

metacritic,overlord23,fifa-22,"The game features various modes, including Career Mode, Ultimate Team (FUT), and Pro Clubs, with each receiving unique improvements. Career Mode offers a more immersive manager and player experience, allowing for greater control over team tactics, transfers, and player progression. FIFA Ultimate Team (FUT) continues to be the most popular mode, where players can create and manage teams through card packs, player trading, and various online competitions. However, the heavy emphasis on microtransactions in FUT has been a point of criticism, as it can lead to a ""pay-to-win"" atmosphere in online play. Another significant update was the improvement of AI and player behavior, making matches feel more lifelike. Defenders act more intelligently, making better tackles, and goalkeepers are more capable of pulling off game-changing saves. The overall match presentation was also enhanced, with more realistic crowd sounds, commentary, and match atmosphere.

metacritic,misjakj,fifa-22,"EA's latest offering emerges as a step backward, underwhelmingly inferior to its predecessor and underscoring a broader decline within both the company and its flagship football series. This disappointment is particularly poignant in light of the forthcoming name change from ""FIFA,"" a move necessitated by the lapse of EA's licensing agreement with the Football Federation. The rebranding not only signifies a low point in EA's game development saga but also epitomizes the company's trend of exploiting its fanbase with a monotonous stream of football simulators and a heavily monetized game structure that locks significant enjoyment behind a paywall. Following FIFA 2020, my enthusiasm for the series has nearly vanished, relegating my engagement to the ""Manager Career"" mode, through which I'll critique the game in its entirety.Manager Career mode was anticipated to be a beacon of innovation, especially with the transition to next-gen consoles in FIFA 21, which promised new animations, situational moments, and an overall fresh gaming experience—expectations that were only partially met. FIFA 22, rather than presenting a breakthrough, continued the trend of incremental updates, prompting me to delay my purchase in anticipation of a seasonal sale. A notable moment came when the game was included in the PlayStation+ subscription, rekindling my interest albeit **** introduction of customizable clubs, including stadium and kit personalization each season, initially seemed like a refreshing change. Yet, the reality was less impressive, with existing clubs limited to minor cosmetic tweaks and no option for kit modifications, a missed opportunity for deeper customization.Performance issues mar the experience with noticeable lags and freezes within menus, contrasting sharply with the smoother gameplay of FIFA 21, highlighting an inexplicable downgrade despite both versions being developed for the PS5. Furthermore, the game suffers from a stark lack of innovation, particularly in the Manager Career mode, which remains stale and neglected. Small club adjustments make up a mere fraction of the game's content, with the bulk feeling as outdated and uninspired as ever.Gameplay has deteriorated into a tedious affair, losing the dynamic and enjoyable elements that characterized the transition from FIFA 20 to FIFA 21. The lack of new animations and gameplay mechanics in FIFA 22 contributes to a sense of stagnation, making matches either unengaging or outright **** Ultimate mode's PRO version exacerbates these issues, featuring an AI that anticipates player moves with frustrating precision, leading to a gameplay experience that feels rigged and unrewarding. Additionally, the game's soundtrack quickly becomes repetitive and grating, pushing players to seek solace in the musical selections from earlier FIFA **** trajectory of the FIFA series paints a grim picture of a franchise in decline, trapped in a cycle of minimal innovation due to EA's monopolistic hold on the sports sim market. With the impending rebrand to ""EA FOOTBALL SOCCER,"" there's little optimism for significant improvement, suggesting a future of continued mediocrity marked by cosmetic updates rather than substantive gameplay enhancements. This cycle seems destined to persist as long as profits remain steady, leaving little hope for a revival of the series' former glory.",2,10

metacritic,rcls,fifa-22,"I would really like to give this game a better score, but there is just one aspect of it that is driving me insane. I¨ve clocked in probably 100 hours on this game and I mostly play local career mode. I started by controlling my own player, and soon moved on to controlling the whole team and I could see my team¨s IQ drop massively.

The AI is absolutely abysmal in defence. The only ways for you to score is to make a run and just zip it behind the goalie. If you try to dribble in the middle, you immediately get marked by at least three opponents and lose the ball. Then you go on defence and you are supposed to control all players on your defensive line because they are useless. 5 players standing in a line, while the opposing AI makes a run by the sideline into the middle and finds the perfect spots with the perfect passes. Opposing players can grab the ball from you if they get too close, but the only way you can grab the ball from them is by intercepting a pass, or by tackling them head on and hope the ball doesn't find it's way to another opponent.

This absolutely pisses me off. Defending makes the game unplayable as you need to focus 80% of your energy on it, and score with the remaining 20% by making a run for it. Player movements are incredibly stiff, passing inaccurate, AI is rather poor and of this seems to indicate that EA is more focused on milking the online side of the game for more money than making it playable for everyone. Too bad.

metacritic,Zski,fifa-22,"It’s hard to find where I stand with FIFA 22. I was a die hard FIFA fan, and bought every single game at launch until around FIFA 17. I stopped because it felt like the new gameplay mechanics were always unpolished which made them feel like they were going backwards with each year, and it felt as if the only thing EA cared about improving was FIFA Ultimate Team, for obvious reasons. I missed the past two years of FIFA, and it definitely feels like all of the updates they made previously are more refined. This is a good thing, but it says a lot about the intentions of the company if it takes them 3-4 years to fix new mechanics that should have been ready to go when they first rolled out. Regardless, we are finally here. It finally feels like a smooth FIFA experience again.

At it’s core, FIFA 22 is a solid FIFA game. It does not shine in any areas, but it’s also not overtly weak in any areas either. It feels like a game that is exactly what it is, a game that is overall very good but makes minimal progress year after year. I think the long running sports franchise is in need of a reboot, just rebuild the entire game from the ground up, because it feels way too similar to the FIFA games I played 10+ years ago. I understand this is generally how sports games are, and from a business angle it makes perfect sense, but I think we are due. The only major issue I have with the game is that it feels like the AI has become much worse. It almost feels like every player has a “zone” they operate in, and they have become more rigid with only playing in their zone. It’s far too common when I send a second defender to pursue the attacker with the ball, he kind of hovers near them and then completely stops covering them, leaving a huge open for a super clean cross. Auto switching and player pursuit has always been an issue, buts noticeably worse.

The graphics are good, but still feel like they are from last generation. The sound design is the same as always, which I must admit has been very good for awhile now. The presentation is just about the same - minor menu changes, minor overlay changes, but it’s all the same. FIFA also needs to figure out something with the Italian league, not that I’m a fan, but they are losing teams a bit too often now.

All in all, I enjoyed FIFA 22. It’s a solid FIFA game, if you enjoy FIFA then there is no reason you wouldn’t like this one. Objectively, I give the game an 8/10, but the series as a whole needs some changes.",6,10

metacritic,SigmaEldritch,fifa-22,"Haven't played Fifa since 2020, the game was free for PS+ this month, so I figured I'd try it out. For the first 2, 3 hours I honestly liked it, controls felt good, passing wasn't perfect but was better than before. But the more I played the worse it got. In order to nerf quick counter attacks they made the camera move so ridiculously slowly that it can take a full second between your player receiving the ball and the camera panning to the player with the ball. I stopped playing after that point. Sure, maybe there's some camera setting that will solve this problem, but the fact that this is a problem with the default camera settings shows just how little thought went into development of the game.

But the most hilarious bug I've had is with the scripting. You can argue that FIFA doesn't script matches all you want, but in my first CL game of the season vs Inter Milan (so first CL game for both teams), I was up 1-0, and somehow on the upper left of the screen it said Lautaro Martinez scored 1 goal in 1 CL game (even though as the score line suggests, Inter haven't scored yet), and sure enough in the second half Inter scored an insane Fifa goal where all my defenders avoided Inter's players like the plague allowing Lautaro to score a goal for Inter.",1,10

metacritic,echo97,fifa-22,"I've read multiple reviews saying that the game is better than Fifa 21. That may be true pre-patch, but now it's ridiculous. There's no question, that when EA touch a game, that have little to no flaws, they all of sudden turn it into a crap game. It is astonishing to me to see all of the changes that were made that make the game worse.
Offline Modes: Career mode is still dull, with the twist of creating your own club, crest, and kit. However, you still cannot build your own stadium, which I find rather odd. You still cannot change your kit after a season, and overall the customization still lacks. Skill games are the same, still no reason for me to play them. Skill games in the past used to give points in the EA catalogue which let you have cool in game items. They were fun, and would often play them friends to compete with them. Now they aren't really that fun, and just fodder I skip past to get to the game.
Volta: It is improved, but if you can't play online, then you're basically screwed. Still not very fun, and very frustrating to play.
Pro Clubs: Haven't got to play this much, but from what I can tell, it's still being neglected.
Ultimate team: Congratulations EA! You really made FUT **** again. It's truly gobsmacking to see you ruin a game mode this year. It is more than true to say that high rated players are less easy to attain. As someone who plays the game pretty consistently, and who opens packs regularly, still getting crappy players. SBC's are also almost impossible for someone like me to open, because I have to constantly sell players in my club or use them in other SBC's. The players you want are simply unattainable, and that's what separates players who have unlimited amounts of resources and time, to beat out the people who just want to play with Messi or Ronaldo in their team. It is pay to win and they know it. The more money you put into the game, the more you can benefit. But it shouldn't be like that. It should be the quality of game that you play. Rewards for playing are still dismal at best. There is no way someone can reasonably can have a good team without sending EA their work check.  Instead of working on new ways to help the player be able to afford good players and craft sbcs, you guys find ways to line your own pockets.
Gameplay: EA did  it again. The end of Fifa 21 wasn't perfect , but was way better than this. Instead of working off of the last game, and making subtle improvements, EA change the entire game. At launch, keepers were insanely good. Now, since the last patch, keepers seriously can't do anything. Finishing is the worst it's ever been. Finesse shots are useless.  Passes, through balls, and crosses are worse than ever. Defending is mind-numbingly bad. Scripted moments are back, and it seriously feels as if the game doesn't want  you to have fun. Chemistry doesn't effect anything anymore. Don't get me started on connection issues.

See EA, as soon as you make a product that is somewhat viable, there always has to be an end line. There always has to be something wrong. There always is another fix. Its a shame. Im very excited for UFL and new games like that so we can stop playing games that aren't worth it.

Update: As of May 2022, I have stopped playing fifa. It is by far the worst fifa title I have ever played by far. There are no redeeming qualities to this game, and I assure you that you will go into a deep depression after playing this game. It makes you hate yourself for playing it. The rewards seem unattainable for casual players, and there isn't an end in sight. The game doesn't feel rewarding anymore. Everything is unbalanced. Nothing works as advertised. I'm done with fifa.

I think we just have to give up on ever getting a good game again. Really, EA only care about making money (micro transactions), the NFL only cares about making money (with the exclusive license), and they both do. They both get their money.  As long as they sell the game (because it's the only NFL game), they'll aways make their money and we'll always complain that they don't fix their game or have any innovation what do ever. I'm to the point (with all of these micro transactions) that I would literally PAY for features. Like buy the game and pay for a good franchise mode.

However, you have to be on a ps4 if you want to play someone else on ps4. Ps5 and ps4 aren’t online compatible on ultimate team. I was so disappointed with Draft Champs.

metacritic,DisneyLover1,madden-nfl-22,"This game is an improvement over Madden 21, just like Madden 21 is an improvement over Madden 20. However, being slightly better than a terrible game doesn't make it a good game. Franchise Mode finally got an update in a long time since the mode was never updated after Madden 25 but even with the Franchise Mode update the mode is still barebones and still is the same thing ever since Madden 25.

Gameplay is still the same ever since EA put Madden on the Frostbite Engine (a First-Person Shooter Game Engine). It's still animation-based and incredibly scripted & the game still doesn't feel or play like a true NFL Simulator. Not to mention that EA signed a 6-Year extension with the NFL for exclusive rights for the Franchise which means we have to wait until 2026 just to see another company make an NFL Simulator. If someone wants to play a licensed NFL Game you can only play this game because of EA's exclusive license with the NFL. JUST PUT ALL OF YOUR BLAME ON THE GAME TOWARDS THE NFL AND EA BECAUSE THEY DON'T CARE AT ALL!!!!

All-Pro Football 2K8 was the last 2K Football Game, despite the fact the game came out in 2007 & it still features the best gameplay in a Football Game even though the game is unlicensed with no official teams but licensed players. APF 2K8 doesn't have a lot of depth, but the gameplay makes it up for the depth. The 6th-Gen Version of Madden 07 is the greatest Madden EVER because of its depth, the Franchise mode still blows any Modern Madden Franchise away because Madden 07 has over 80+ features that aren't in a Madden Game today. Madden 07's gameplay wasn't great and it didn't feel realistic like the 2K Games, it felt arcade-like but it was at least fun and challenging but it felt better than Modern Madden because it wasn't ruled by scripted animations. Madden 07 lacked in gameplay, but it was made up for its depth. What makes Madden 22 horrible is that it doesn't succeed at either Gameplay or Depth!!

When you boot up the game, it still shows the same game modes from Madden 21 but EA added a new mode called ""Championship Series"" but it's just a part of Ultimate Team. When you boot up Championship Series it just takes you to Ultimate Team forcing you start spending your money on MUT packs. P2W Game Modes don't deserve to exist in a fully-priced game like this. There's just another Face of the Franchise story & small Franchise updates with nothing else new. Madden 22's FOTF is lame & you can only play as either a Quarterback or Linebacker (older Madden Superstar modes allow you to play any position even Kicker or Offensive Lineman). You can't change your player's number in College, the cutscenes look like PS3 graphics or worse, the script is so BAD it makes you wanna skip every cutscene & it could force you to stop playing the game in general. When you start the mode it forces you to play Tutorial drills over & over, you can't change the college difficulty, & once you get drafted to the NFL the mode doesn't have any other incentives to keep you playing.

THERE IS NO CARE PUT INTO THIS GAME & EVERYTHING IS JUST RE-USED FROM OLDER MADDENS OR OTHER EA SPORTS GAMES & ITS STILL FAR BEHIND FROM OLDER MADDEN GAMES!! THE GAME ISN'T WORTH $60 & IT SHOULDN'T BE BOUGHT FROM ANYONE EXCEPT YOUTUBERS, STREAMERS, OR MADDEN SIMPS WHO THINK THE GAME IS GOD-LIKE!!!

Madden 22 the more I played the more frustrating it became to the point that the game was no longer fun. The animations especially for blocking is horrible.  The passing defense have had me on full tilt. DBs randomly give up routes to blitz, which at first i thought was a bug but i think its actually a mechanic. I want to feel challenge with play calling but their are plays that are just broken, some plays just work no matter what the defense calls and their are defense plays that just don't work because the players do attempt to cover their zones. There are more problems with the game but those have been what killed it for me. The most i will say is i do like the commentary but after a few game, their scripts become out of wack. For example they sometimes talk like the other time is on offense. Not the commenter fault but anyways i don't like bashing games but this deserves to be bashed,",1,10

When you switch to the receiver, you are slowed down, and this usually ends in a forced interception. 99 speed RB gets caught by a much slower MLB.

Lets start with the most frustrating one. Why in the HELL is EA releasing a $60 game on PC in its OLD GEN form... If you aren't aware, The old gen version of Madden 23 is the same game as Madden 22, you get none of the new features. So why pay for a NEW game if its not really new?

metacritic,Zski,madden-nfl-23,"I have been playing Madden games for probably around 20 years. However historically, I skip a few years each time, and I only purchase after the football season to save on the cost. The reason for this is echoed in every review you see if every Madden game in recent memory: the improvements are often minimal or they take the game in the wrong direction, the games have the same glitches for many years in a row that are never ironed out, the balancing of the game feels really off to which you have to spend a couple hours playing with the sliders to have reasonably realistic stats and scores, and graphics/presentations that are just many years behind par. Most of these issues are present in Madden 23. It’s been a few years since I played Madden, but typically I play at least one franchise season (15 or so hours), but unfortunately I cannot get myself past half a season of this game.

To start with something positive that I truly appreciate about the game: They actually got the balancing done pretty well out of the box: stats and scores are pretty realistic. The negative counter balance to that is the extremely overbearing momentum meter. While I’m sure momentum was built into other Madden games, it is just way too obvious and way too present. One touchdown and an interception on the opponents first drive almost maxes out the momentum meter, which is fine and I understand what they’re going for, but when you are the team that is down, the uphill climb is extremely unreasonable. Players will regularly run poor routes, drop easy catches, and fail to make most blocks. The only way to overcome the momentum meter is luck, because skill gets dampened so much. It’s ridiculous and makes the game very frustrating, especially when you miss easy players or give up massive plays due to the same glitches you have seen for years. The teleporting ball, the ball that magnets into a receivers hands, the players sliding off of the running back, all of those wonderful glitches that I have seen for 10 years are still in there! The same weird character models are in the game, where the super stars look life like, but the lesser known players look ridiculous. Somehow FIFA has to model an absurd amount of players from a huge amount of teams and they do very well with the major leagues - meanwhile Madden can’t do one league of 32 teams. It’s lazy. The visuals aren’t bad, but they don’t feel like they’re from this generation and have a lot of lazy corner cutting.

As much as I would love to hate rate it a 1/10 because I’m tired of the only NFL game series to be such a lazy cash grab, I have to objectively give it a 5/10. It’s playable, you can have some fun with it, but the flaws are tough to ignore in this one and really ruin the longevity of how much time you can spend on the game.",5,10

Because the gameplay is still tragic. OLine logic is terrible and the DBs know who you're throwing to before your WR does.

Further, MUT is more and more spending driven. Every release, even with really good content, comes with bugs and other experience breaking issues.

When the much anticipated Team Diamonds and their sets were released, the auction house prices went wild with crazy and constant fluctuations. This cause the EA bots (or whatever system they use) to flag users for coin distribution or other TOS violations. The appeal process must be a sham because many users, myself included, who simply sold cards for what the market said they were worth had their coins taken and appeals rejected.

If EA actually cared about their player, they wouldn't have an either understaffed team or a team incapable of producing a good product. I'm inclined to believe their staff is, at worst, decent, but way too much is asked of far too few.

Away from MUT, the Franchise mode had other game breaking bugs that it took 2+ months to fix. Who knows what new bugs will appear in the coming days and weeks.

There are so many new bugs plus old bugs that been in the game since forever. Ea  will never fix this problem and they don't care. Warning  people offended this game don't fall for them  they are delusional and probably never played the old madden's i use to love the franchise but it gotten sick. Ooh and guess what it the same comuntray form madden 17 yes madden 17. They haven't change the comuntray since then there annoying and madden hasn't even changed there line's so they say the same things over and over and no existment either in the old madden's the comuntray get very wild when big plays happen in this game they just have no emotion at all and they sometimes say things that happen w plays ago.

metacritic,BringBackNcaa,madden-nfl-23,"EA has proven once more, that no serious innovation and solely relying on the fans love for Football is still enough for some ""reviewers"" to come out and claim that Madden is ""improving"" and ""moving in the right direction"".

At this point, I am just sad because of this company. For years the fans simply ask for features of previous games like an actual chance to create their own team with some artistic freedom rather than pre-generated teams. Additionally the entire gameplay still feels like pre-set animations glued together. Just replay any situation where a RB passes its o-line and gets to the next level and you will see, that 90% of the meaningful impacts between players look scripted.

But at this point, even reviews are meaningless, since the NFL just doesn't care and the only glimpse of hope would be to end the EA monopoly and finally give other companies the chance to create a game, where fans can seriously get involved and create their own stuff. These creation aspects are essential for true immersion.

But no one of the NFL or EA will read this anyway. And the MUT-lovers will carry this product once more.

Hopefully none of the decision makers behind Madden will be involved in the development of EA College Football in 2023. But lets be real folks, this is EA and this game just isn't about you fans, it's about your money.",0,10

metacritic,Reazistor,madden-nfl-23,Once again a bitter disappointment from ea especially when it comes to franchise mode. Franchise mode was set to have all these changes yet it looks almost identical with a little polish on the menu screen. Playing against the CPU on all Madden still just gives the CPU whatever they want leaving you to either have to cheese the game to win or just running the clock out. The new passing mechanic doesn't seem to work all that differently from the other maddens either especially from 17 when this passing mechanic was first introduced. Blocking in this game is fundamental but apparently not when it comes to Madden as you have about 1.5 seconds to throw the football on a shotgun play even with a good offensive line. Players are stingy and want big contracts even if they are 72 overall and haven't played well. I was really hoping this year would be different but it's not so I'm done I'll just go to 2k for my sports games because EA doesn't know how to make one apparently,0,10

Have you seen the rendered hair of Trevor Lawrence during the intro? Laughable.. of course you haven't though because no one uses the Jags but I did.. I am sure other player models are atrocious.. The added game play gimmicks don't add anything.. refs are missing from the field yet again.. I prefer the pace of 22, as i said, way too fast and not realistic on the field.. Defense intercepts almost every pass that isnt wide open throws.. the game is a mess.. I read EA wants players word of mouth to sell this game.. got bad news for them, i think as people play this game more over the next few days they will not like it. This is the first year i started a trial instead of blindly buying it and im happy i did that... I don't plan to purchase this year.. will wait for game pass and play madden 22 and get to use college teams in superstar KO mode..

metacritic,lan19,madden-nfl-23,"I only bought this game for the sake of doing trophies. For the sake of your money, DO NOT BUY IT.

I swear they never play test the game, if you go into Face of Franchise mode as CB you will realize most of the goals in-game for you to earn XP are null, you can meet those requirements but nothing will happen. The only explanation I can conjure up is that the goals such as ""hold the opponent to 60 rushing yards"" actually mean your opponent needs to get to 60 yards because I earned it when my opponent had 100 rushing yards. You can tell they never play test it because I can report up to 20 errors in the Face of Franchise mode in 5 hours of playing.

And let's not talk about how the Franchise mode basically a copy and paste from Madden 17, but more glitchy with interface for some reason?

There are also tons of funny visual glitches, here's the most consistent one you can trigger: if you go to the training, you will see 7 identical white dude coaches holding up the clipboard in the cut scene.

I'm guessing the developers of EA outsource these ""new"" modes' coding to the cheapest labor possible and never bothered to play test them out; the quality of the game really translates the effort they have put in.

metacritic,AdrianMD,madden-nfl-23,"Franchise: The fantasy draft feature/presentation, implemented in Madden 19, has gone untouched through Madden 20, 21, 22, and now 23. I’ve found this to be a microcosm of the lack of effort to not only innovate, but at the absolute least, to iterate on previous installments of the franchise.

To willfully sell a product in which so little effort is taken to demonstrate growth year over year is truly astounding to me. It used to be that you may pickup on similarities between yearly releases in short spurts as you played the game throughout the year. Nowadays, it is blatantly obvious the degree to which development has become copy paste in favor of maximizing profits for lack of development and innovation in a product sold at full price annually. Not only are the similarities evident, but considerable legacy issues persist without any attempts to remedy or find solutions to resolve them.

(e.g. Franchise trade logic—stated improvements every year and little to no improvement is demonstrated. Improvement to simulation stats in franchise— they actually find a way to get worse. Added immersion within franchise free agency—unrealistic roster moves make the experience completely inaccurate and introduce a new issue that wasn’t in previous installments. Then, in Madden 24, they will tout how they’ve improved free agency as if they’ve addressed an issue they didn’t just introduce in the previous installment).

Just a lazy excuse for a full-priced, licensed franchise. EA should be ashamed of the product they’ve produced and the NFL should be embarrassed to continue allowing this company to helm their exclusive simulation license. I hope 2K’s “non-simulation”game introduces a modicum of competition to the monopoly that EA has been granted the right to for decades now, and at the very least forces them to add referees back into their “simulation” experience.",1,10

This time around the bugs are so extensive that it makes you question if they even tested the game at all. Franchise mode is completely broken and unplayable still over a week past it's release. Trading player to player fails, weeks advanced get reset, players cut come back on the team, players signed go back to the waivers. Meanwhile the developers only worry about MUT and that mode has bugs and glitches everywhere as well.

In true EA fashion, all they have done is a roster update and 1 fancy new mechanic. The same they do every year only this time it seems as though they took a backward step on visuals. So many players are appearing fatter with guts this year, the look of Jersey fits and shoulder pads are odd and make you question if you're playing a next generation console game.

To it's credit I felt the passing leads work well and made you have a real sense of control when trying to fit balls in tight spaces. This should have been in the game a long time ago though.

EA continues to hand out subpar games because they have no competition and they know NFL fans will just buy it anyway.

Some questionable ratings for certain players aside, most of the choices made for Madden NFL 23 do make sense. The problem is that there isn’t enough of those types of choices to really score many extra points. If you’re a die-hard Madden fan who has been loving the series lately, this iteration will give you what you want. But if you have been waiting for that big overhaul or reboot that might revitalize your interest, then you may want to continue that wait.

This game is super fun with friends if you have a full group, and don’t have to type to randoms. My only minor complaints would be the servers being over capacity during the majority of ‘peak’ times. Also randoms leave quiet frequently in the games causing some games to be very short so that’s a bummer if you don’t have a full group. At the end of the day this is a Gem to be treasured with your closest friends, and even a game where you can make new better friends who won’t sus you first round and throw you out into space you know who you are (cat you sus ass )",10,10

Set aboard a spaceship, players must complete tasks while trying to uncover who among them is the Impostor—a player secretly working to sabotage and eliminate the others without being detected. Player interaction is central to the experience, with moments of tension and accusation that create a unique and engaging **** visual design is minimalist but effective, featuring colorful characters and simple maps that allow players to focus on the gameplay. The mechanics are accessible to everyone, which has contributed to its massive popularity, especially among friends and families. The excitement of *Among Us* lies in the discussions and bluffing during meetings, where players attempt to convince others of their innocence or shift suspicion onto others.Regular updates to maps and game modes add variety, though the gameplay can feel repetitive after extended sessions.

Lobbies can also randomly crash at anytime, and there is no punishment for players leaving games simply because they didn't get the role they wanted. Despite this, the roles add a new layer of the game and heavily alter how difficult it is to catch the right person, while also making it difficult to trust anyone.

Only download if you are planning to play with friends",6,10
metacritic,LT_Gruber,among-us,"Great and simple game with hours of fun.

Among us was a completely new concept and a unique new experience for me. It is so simple, yet so fun to play.

You play with a group of people and friends, in different spaceship maps, each containing a different area. On a map, different rooms with various tasks are present. The crew members, aka the “good guys”, need to complete the tasks to win the game. When everyone is done with their chores, victory is theirs.

Meanwhile, one player is an imposter, who pretends to be a crew mate, but is secretly murdering everyone and sabotaging their work. It is the imposter’s goal to murder everyone or to hold off the completing of tasks, until the timer runs out.

When other players find a body, or saw something suspicious, they can call for a meeting. In this meeting, dead players are muted and the rest can determine who the imposter might be. This can be done in text or speech. When people know or suspect someone, a vote can be cast, after which the player with the most votes is yeeted out of the space ship.

The imposter has some handy tricks up his sleeve. He can sabotage certain parts of the ship like communications, oxygen, overheating or overheating the reactors. In this events, the other players cannot continue with their work until the problem is solved. Giving the imposter the time to hunt down lone players or to escape through the many air vents in the game for fast travel.

In terms of graphics, Among Us is nothing special. It uses simple and jolly 2D graphics with fluent animations. The cartoon style really fits the game well.

The sound on the other hand is solid. Alarms are loud and trigger your attention, the soft footsteps, the sound of a vent opening, it is all great and mysterious. All sounds also really help you determine what is going on around you, it is just very well implemented.

The controls are fluent and easy to understand. It takes some time to learn all the buttons and actions but you will get used to it soon enough.

This game is really all about tactics, choosing the right moment and timing your sabotages right. Matches can be over in seconds because someone betrayed their identity at the start of the game, and sometimes, a match goes on for a good half hour because the cards have been played so well, nobody has the slightest clue who could be the imposter. There are just so many different ways in which you can play this game. With big groups, the game is a lot of fun because the imposters are now with two and the length of the match, confusion and overall chaos is increased. I found it especially fun with a group of friends.

The only downside to Among Us are the idiots or trolls that sometimes join matches, just to cause some uproar and fights between players. They spoil stuff, put random stuff in the chat that makes no sense or do not actively engage in the meetings to determine who is the imposter.

Another small issue is the hostility of some players. They take the game way too serious and when accused or accusing someone, it sometimes actually feels like someone is trying to solve a murder on their loved ones. People get mad sometimes or vote you out of the space ship just because you did not give the response they wanted. Of course, this is a small group of people, but it can still be annoying sometimes.

The game play is repetitive because you always have the same objective, but with this game, it is just perfect and does not need any other modes or styles of playing.

In the end, I think this is one of the most surprising and fun games I have played in a while and I would recommend it to everyone.",10,10

It is really fun as a crewmate running around doing tasks and trying to find out who the imposter is and trying not to get killed. BY FAR the most fun comes when you become imposter and have to go round killing, hiding in the vents and lying to other crewmates, it is so thrilling and nerve racking! And with its cosmetics and  Hide and Seek mode it makes for more fun! I we are talking negatives the server can be laggy or disconnects at times and depending on what people you play with will majorly effect your experience!

This means that you’re enjoyment of Among Us will very much depend on the group you’re playing with.

They have made millions of dollars from the game and could easily reinvest some of that money into hiring programmers to fix glitches, but they haven't. They don't care about their customers at all.

Among Us is also plagued by cheaters, and Innersloth doesn't actually do anything about it. I know because I have ""reported users for hacking/cheating"" for blatantly obvious cheating only to find those same exact users still using the game the next day. Their website claims ""bad faith reports… will result in enforcement of consequences,"" which is their excuse for ignoring this problem. They haven't banned me for ""bad faith reports"" and they haven't banned cheaters for cheating, by the way. That's just their excuse for doing nothing.

I sent an email to them via the Contact Us link on their website about this, and they haven't replied. I bet this review will be ignored by them too, but you should heed my warning. Innersloth and Among Us are terrible. Wait until another game developer makes a game like Among Us but without glitches and without cheaters. Then buy that game instead.",0,10

metacritic,TwiTu,among-us,"Its an awesome idea and is a lot of fun for a long time if you know enough people to play with with voice chat.
But technically its a very bad game. What I mean is that its framework is really bad.

They should have added voice chat support a long time ago. They could have increased player count. They could have added many more maps. They could have added more game modes.
But they did nothing of that. They pretty much are the definition of to rest on one's laurels.

If you think you will have fun playing with silent strangers from random servers, you will have a bad awakening. And you wont find new friends in this game either, because its so massively restricted in social interaction. You almost feel like youre playing against bots.

You may think “it’s fun with friends”. Well, all games are fun with friends. Among Us is one such case where your friend makes it fun, not the game itself.

So you might as well go rate every online game in existence with a 0 because you are bound to have a bad experience. Also teling the devs to add anti cheats and new content and ranked systems is ok I guess, but remember, their team of devs is one coder, and some artists. So it will take some time. My point is stop giving bad reviews because of some toxic people. Also someone said the game graphics are bad so it gets a 0, like you don't need great graphics for a game to be good, anyway I gave it a 9 for what it is, fun gameplay and when you play with friends or have a decent group of randoms, the game can be very fun.",9,10

It's a little bit difficult to understand at first, but the enjoyability that you have playing makes your search further about what to do/make in Rimworld. I feel euphoric just to play 10 minutes of the game, i love it with all my heart",10,10

metacritic,Elcranio92,rimworld,"i have done things in this game that would torn the backbone of a ww2 soldier out of its back... but we have to survive on an unknown planet filled with enemies... every animal (even rats) can end your journey in a matter of seconds and if you survive their rampage a raid of cannibals or alien mechanical monsters will torn you apart striking your base.

every aspect of this game is nearly perfect we are asked to deal with so many game mechanichs like base building, colonists management, resourses farming and factions reputations; every dlc puts a new step of complexity that perfectly merges withwhat was build before.

the only downside in my opinion is the difficulty to find a balance in the narration mechanism, we can custom it but in the end game the events are really really challenghing every time.",9,10

i plan to give this another shot, but my introductory experience has not left me with any desire to play more of the game.",4,10
metacritic,SentientMilk,rimworld,"A rich colony management game that is only limited by your imagination, Rimworld is a chef's kiss **** that'll always keep you coming back for more. Every colony will be different so will the complex story that unfolds before you with the deep game mechanics that give you a level of detail unseen in any other game. Victories, tragedies, relationships, and loss will all be part of your colony's unique story. Will your colony be a group of nudist cannibals, zealous holy order, drug pushing mercs, or a safe haven for fleeing the many dangers of the rimworld? It's all up to you. Beyond just the story, there's plenty to do in the game to keep you hooked and it goes well beyond just building a colony and making sure it survives. The visuals may not be your favorite, it personally kept me from trying out the game for a while, but there's a reason why it's one of the most highly rated games on Steam. Once you give it a try you'll never want to put it down and will always be a staple of your gaming library. How such a complex and enjoyable game was produced by an indie dev is amazing and just goes to show the level of care and talent that they possess as it blows most AAA games out of the water for half the price. With a handful of DLCs the complete package can get pricey but they're fully worth it, especially when it directly supports the great indie team over at Ludeon Studios. But if the DLCs aren't for you, Rimworld is fully intertwined with the modding community and you'll have no trouble finding what you like to personally tailor the game to your own gameplay style. I personally recommend trying out the Vanilla series as it adds so much to the game without changing its core. In my opinion, Rimworld is one of the best games I've ever had the experience to try and if you haven't given it a shot yourself you're truly missing out.",10,10

metacritic,RelarMage,rimworld,"Ludeon Studios is the worst. The devs only care about their own profit and make money thanks to the work of the modding community (most people wouldn't play unmodded Rimworld.)

The base game ****. You need a mod for every single missing or defective thing. And there are a lot of missing basic features. You have to spend a lot of time researching which mods you can add (many are buggy or conflict with each other.)

Every time there's an update, you have to stop playing and wait for all your mods to be updated too. The dev log is often useless as it doesn't tell you what mod is causing a bug.

The devs, who are also community admins, enable bullying and lie to cover it up. They only enforce their rules when they feel like it. They have a moderator (Jdalt) who insults people in their Discord and doesn't punish those who harass you. Instead, he punishes you. They leave posts where users expose those who criticize them so others find their Steam profiles and harass them. 

They are also accused of copying the code from popular mods for their DLCs and updates, and of censoring those who criticize them. They lie in their reply to reviews saying they have fixed a lot of stuff when they have barely fixed anything.",0,10

Upon seeing dozens of players with over 1000 hours in this game, I figured there must be a lot to do, well let me tell you, there seriously isnt. Aside from the very basics you can expect from a base-building game, you can expect to constantly micromanage idiotically programmed AI and ensure your pawns are happy by placing a chess table where they will play chess by themselves, drastically boosting their mood. This game is ridiculously stupid, the pawns are ridiculously annoying and ugly looking and after about 30 hours the game becomes stale and playing it becomes an unenthusiastic endeavour. After about 25 hours of playing rimworld, I just ended up making several molotov **** and forcing my pawns to raise their crops and torch their home before killing themselves, but not even that would satisfy my hatred of this game and the horribly animated characters. This game isnt even worth 4$, let alone 40$, and I have no idea why people are willing to cough up that much money for this horribly designed amalgamation.

metacritic,indie_playerka,rimworld,"The day has come when I will tell you about my favorite indie game - RimWorld by Ludeon Studios. It's a colony simulator. In the classic scenario, we crash-land with 3 characters and 1 pet on an alien planet with resources that will last for a few days. We must survive, build a base, gather food, discover new things, and not succumb to random events.I have the impression that in this game, you can truly do everything, and if it turns out that you can't, the Steam Workshop is full of mods, and you will surely find whatever you can think of 
I'll focus on the base game, but there are also 3 DLCs that I'll review soon.

On the plus side:
+ 3 different storytellers who influence how often and what kind of events will happen in our gameplay, from peaceful idyll to continuous tragedy
+ Different game scenarios, e.g., ""Naked Brutality"" - starting completely naked and ""happy"" as a castaway, the ability to create your own scenarios
+ Extensive research tree - from lack of electricity to building a spaceship
+ Diverse flora and fauna; we can have animal husbandry+ Weather that affects the environment, e.g., we need to sew warm clothes for winter
+ Our initial castaways are generated randomly, each with their own statistics, personality traits, childhood and adulthood descriptions, mood, injuries, missing limbs, illnesses, and addictions
+ Hostile and friendly factions; we can fight and trade with them
+ Everything needs to be produced by ourselves or bought
+ Relationships between colonists
+ Quests
+ Prisoners that we can recruit, kill, release, harvest organs from, or worse, turn into, for example, a hat or food (and here's the hat puzzle in the picture solved; Rimworld players often joke that the game's biggest feature is the ability to make a hat from human skin)
+ Enormous replayability, and thanks to mods, we can create an entirely new game; some mods are like separate DLCsAnd I could go on and on.

 I also have a series on my YouTube channel - feel free to check it out :) There's no better game for me - 10/10.",10,10

metacritic,jonu86,rimworld,Probably the best strategy game (actually it's so much more) I will ever have played. Great value for money.,10,10
metacritic,Zski,rimworld,"I enjoyed my time with Rimworld. It starts off with a really intense learning curve, where everything feels pretty overwhelming and the appeal of the game is unclear. But the game does a pretty good job of introducing the concepts at just the right cadence, so that by the time the next element of gameplay is introduced, the last one is becoming almost automatic. I bring this up because this is essential for a game with this level of complexity. The way you naturally gain control over what you are doing sets the tone for the rest of the game, and that is when it really sinks its hooks in. You can almost tell the exact moment when the game clicks with you and the addiction has started. The core attraction of the game is the complex colony management system. The graphics, the music, and the presentation are very unremarkable. So the biggest way to sell the game is just to watch a Youtube video providing basic tutorials of the management system. It looks like an incredibly simple game, but the complexity underneath the hood. This game is designed exclusively for fans of the colony building/management genre.

The game went through waves of interest for me, at times I was absolutely hooked, other times I felt like I was mindlessly moving through the motions. In the end, it kept me entertained for a very long time despite the fluctuating excitement levels. If this is a genre that interests you this is absolutely worth checking out and you are guaranteed to get your money's worth. Most of my friends list have 200+ hours in the game, some as high as over 600 hours. I don't think I will be one of the players to make it to that level. This is absolutely worth checking out. If this genre interests you then you'll get plenty of hours out of this. In my case, I got plenty of enjoyment out of it, but my interest levels fluctuated so much.",8,10

metacritic,Xenos7,rimworld,"I've tried the game with a 10-euros Epic coupon, making for a 16 euros price, which is, well, acceptable for what the game is. I honestly think the enormous success of RimWorld relies on two things, more than on its own merits:

1) an extremely dedicated, and actually somewhat fanatic, community, which made it kinda of a cult item.
2) Mods

Now, mods are very nice but a game should be judged by its own merits. If RimWorld was sold as a pack of developer tools, then fine, but it's sold a stand-alone game and so mods should be excluded from the evaluation. So, what is it? A colony management game with some clever ideas, a detailed character system, random events adding some spice. And then the bads: terrible AI forcing the player into extreme micromanagement and an overall lack of content (as I said, in the base game), even if compared with other indie games. Also, very clunky interface.

People will tell you this is a ""story generator"". Beyond the fancy words, it just means the game gives you random events, interacting with your colony and characters, and you make up a story from them. Yeah, kinda like The Sims. It's nothing extremely innovative or surprising. As I said, a lot of people seem to just venerate this game for reasons I don't really understand, and I think it's just one of those cases of perfectly normal products getting a cult following that reinforces itself over time.

Now, I would have given the game 6 or even 7 if it wasn't for one terrible decision: the game never goes on sale. The Epic coupon was just there for every game on the store, but RimWorld itself is always full priced. And we're talking an old game here (alpha was in 2013). This is extremely anti-consumer and if a mentality like this was to spread PC gaming would go downhill in the blink of an eye: many people, especially young people and folks from poorer countries, would be cut off from the hobby; and the market would concentrate around few extensively-covered, hyped games, because nobody could discover hidden gems during sales, kinda likes console market was years ago. This really shouldn't be supported and I will never buy something from this dev again.

It's also ridiculous if you think you can get four or five more recent AAA great games, on sale, for the fixed RimWorld price. Right now, XCOM 2 is 3 euros on Steam. Do I need to tell you how much better XCOM is? Really, if you look at the market, you realize that wanting to sell at full price an indie game almost 10 years old with little production value in it (there are no animations, no effects, sounds and graphics are even below indie average) is just arrogance and insulting to customers and other devs.",3,10

metacritic,Demiurge11,rimworld,"This is a 2D birds-eye-view tower-defense game with a science-fiction spin. While there is a strategy element, the main focus of the game is storytelling.

THE GOOD:
- This is an intensely addictive and fun game.
- Play virtually any kind of story you want, so long as it involves a handful of colonists trying to survive on an alien planet! I once tried a primitive start, with my bow-and-arrow wielding people living among dinosaurs. They survived, thrived, and eventually had omni-bots doing all their work for them. It was epic!
- The game design is really great, where the controls allow you to do everything you want, but it's designed so it's easy to lose track of some details or forget something. There's plenty of opportunity for excitement and drama, whether it's created by the game's built-in storyteller (who throws events at you), from your own mistakes, your colonists' interactions, or just your imagination.
- The game is backed by some really fun and thoughtful science-fiction.
- The mod community is amazing and gives the game tons of staying power and replayability. Every player has their own list of must-have mods. Mod management through the Steam Workshop is pretty simple.
- There is an incredible multiplayer mod available that smoothly enables co-op play.
- I played through the Royalty expansion and it also adds a lot of really fun extra gameplay, as well as a cool new win condition, and is worth picking up.

THE BAD:
- After some hundred of hours of gameplay I started to see the pattern in the main storyteller (Cassandra)'s semi-random events. This was solved by switching to everyone's favourite storyteller: Randy Random.

THE UGLY:
- In 600+ hours of playing this game (some of it offline, so Steam didn't count it), I've had the game crash on me once or twice. Otherwise, it's really stable, even with lots of mods running.
- The developer will update the game in the middle of your playthrough via Steam, and there's no way to stop this. Sometimes, this might break mods you are currently using and ruin a game in progress. There are workarounds, but they require some tech savvy.",10,10

Well, ask any game who even remotely liked a city builder once in their life and who got their hands on this game, that will be a yes.

Learning curve ? There is.
Replayability ? There is. Emphasized with the DLC.
Increasing difficulty ? You go.

Rimworld is not merciful. It's harsh, but with every lose comes experience. You get to painfully learn why you lose during the last minutes of every game, and you'll go further not doing it again.

There really are no downsides to the game, if you like the pitch of it, then you'll get what you expect and more.

metacritic,Ndi,rimworld,"As a long time fan of fiddling for hours with a map, Rimworld is right up my very narrow alley.

Surprisingly complex, well balanced and a broad array of mods and options make it very customizable and the fact that they glued combat in a build game and I'm not complaining is an achievement in itself.

It's so well done that I still find myself pressing space in other games attempting to suspend time and deal with everyone being on fire, the base being on fire, the pets being on fire and the fire being on fire.

You are the planer for a small colony of people. Manage their needs an wants, while defending the colony from murderus raiders and hungry spacemonsters. All while researching new equipment and gimmicks for your colony.

In short: Its a building simulation that will keep you entertained for many many hours.
It has a solid foundation and the many many mods make it even better and will keep you entertained for many more hours.

The only game in the genre i can think off, that is deeper might be dwarf fortress, which was obviously a heavy inspiration. that being said, while in comparison, rimworld might not have as much freedom, it does run better for a way longer time and you do not need to fear fps deaths.

So ultimate score would be 9, the only thing that could be done better is more gimmicks.",9,10
metacritic,hafaz,rimworld,"been here since almost early acces, take a little breath 9 month ago, coming back just this day and still have a same excitment to play this game just like the first time i've played this game. tons of mods, very deep mechanics and game play, almost no restriction to have you own gameplay, the only limit is your imagination. the great things about this game is, with that creative aspect and limitless gameplay you still have a mission to fulfill, so you wont get bored. there are many player with more than 3.000 hours played and still exciting with the game",10,10
metacritic,nat2066,rimworld,"It seems almost impossible to describe the true brilliance of this game. The best phrasing I can imagine is that it's kind of like TF2. It doesn't really do anything new, it follows its genre's tropes and expectations but also improves upon it with its own unique twist mechanics. Take for instance the mood of your colonists. Morale is nothing new in city building/simulation games, however Rimworld handles it by using a new and incredibly numerically specific method to make it easy to understand,. and gives the player a clear idea of what they need to do. The best words I can use to bring the true quality of this game into perspective is that it is a Landmark on the base building/survival/simulation genre. It is a damn near master piece that will be looked back upon for generations and will serve as a past example of greatness for many future game developers. Or at least... it should be. It's not exactly popular amongst the simulation community, even if it is ranked as one of the highest rating simulation games on steam. I don't hear much discussion of it and I know this is a monumental long shot but it wasn't even a nominee for any awards in the game awards. And it could easily fit into many of the different possible awards, such as independent game, fresh indie game, strategy game, and community support (the games modding community is incredible, but that's a whole other 10 page long essay). But it makes sense because that's the scale this game is on. Its so good it rivals many of the big shot triple A strategy games being made present day, and that's when the game is at its worst. At its best the game is untouchable and is absolutely unrivaled to anything that has ever come and will ever come. Ok that may be a bit of an exaggeration but you get the idea. The games good. Go get it. Its fun and interesting and it contains hundreds of hours of entertainment.",10,10

metacritic,OmegaPenguins,balatro,"To preface this review I purchased and played the game on Mobile so some of the systems may be a little different to that of console, I feel like my decision to do so greatly enhanced my enjoyment of the game.

Balatro was was quite a surprise to me when I played it. I initially picked it up looking for a game I could play in short 15-30 minute bursts, but those ""quick"" play sessions turned into hours of playing because of how easy and addictive the gameplay was. This games can be so much fun when you have a great setup and you get rolling, but if you don't get set up it can be torture, because you hold out hope thinking ""I can make it to the next blind, then I'm sure I can get a good card then"".

The only drawback to the game is that after playing for a while you can start to get bored, especially if you get several bad games in a row. It can **** the fun out of the game temporarily, but that feeling never lasted too long.

Overall I have enjoyed my time with Balatro and I will continue to enjoy it whenever I feel the hankering to dive back in for one more run!",8,10
metacritic,SSCheetah,balatro,Absurdly overrated. You progress to unlock decks and other modifiers but the mechanics really just stay the same. After a few runs you realise you're just doing the same thing over and over with no real progression or variation... What's the point?

First of all, there is close to no sense of progression. Because of that, every game feels way too repetitive, which gives me no incentive to keep playing. Second of all - and probably the worst thing about this game, - there is simply way too much luck involved. It was common for me to lose 5 minutes into a run just because I wasn't getting anything good in the shop. So, no progression and too much dependency on luck - how is that considered ""good game design""? I just don't get it.",4,10

metacritic,ThatDudeJav,balatro,"Amazing game. So many combos, it is truly unbelievable and would definitely recommend anybody to play",10,10
metacritic,BornABrawler,balatro,"⦿ Balatro probably passed under the radar for most people until its nomination at The Game Awards 2024. While on the surface it looks plain compared to the rest of the competition, I can confidently say it earned its spot and that it had an honest shot at winning the Game of The Year award. To summarize what makes Balatro so engaging is no easy task, but I will give it my best. ⦿ GAMEPLAY: At face value, Balatro is poker that mimics the single-player nature of Solitaire games. You are dealt cards and you may play them for poker hands or discard unwanted cards and draw more. However the main mechanic of the game are the peculiar cards up top, called jokers. These jokers have special abilities that, generally, enhance the score of your played hand. There are 150 jokers to experiment with, most of which will lead you to play to a specific poker hand. The mixing and matching of jokers are the soul of Balatro’s emergent gameplay loop, although there are several more bonuses that will assist a run. Planets will upgrade the level of a poker hand, tarot cards have varying effects that influence your deck, and vouchers are investments that have a variety of powerful benefits. There are some I have omitted but these are your main purchasables that will make or break your run. And your obstacles in the game are the blinds (or rounds) that you play. Each blind has a score to reach, and if you do not succeed the run is over and you must restart. Although your greatest challenge will be the boss blinds - these have additional rules that will be enforced. Blinds get more difficult to surpass as the ante increases, which is caused by defeating the current boss blind. However, defeat the boss blind of ante eight and you win! Although this is far from the end of the game, as unlockables provide you goals to chase and the variety of decks change the rules of the game. Stakes will impose limitations on your current deck and challenge decks saddle you with a specific objective. This breadth of content is what keeps Balatro fresh and fun. Although there’s something else that captures the attention of the player even more. ⦿ PRESENTATION: Simply put, there is no game I have played that “feels” the same as Balatro. The soundtrack, while incredibly short, all stems from one central piece and the literal flow of the music matches the gameplay. It’s beyond an earworm and is an essential part of the experience. And the same can be said for the visuals. While pixelated graphics are not uncommon in games, I appreciate how its style is very “readable.” I do mean this for every card and symbol, whether that be a playing card, joker, tarot, etc. It makes playing the game much easier and faster. And finally is the hypnotic smear in the background. I’m impressed that it sets the game’s tone while not being overbearing or distracting. Looking outside I can see how my compliments are hyperbolic, but I am confident that anyone who has also played the game shares these sentiments. ⦿ PERSONAL THOUGHTS: Before playing Balatro I respected the game from afar. I could recognize its impact in the indie community and gave it kudos for embracing a pretty unexplored genre. That all changed when I finally picked it up. The game is downright addictive, the perfect vibe for “just one more run.” While I am purposefully taking a break to play other things, this did not stop me from beating the white stake of every deck and achieving the insurmountable gold stake for my yellow deck. I do not anticipate completing Balatro in its entirety, but I also don’t think it expects that. It just wants the player to experiment and have fun. ⦿ FINAL ASSESSMENT: Balatro is phenomenal and an achievement in not only indie gaming sphere but gaming as an entertainment medium. It is a game I cannot find fault in, and despite me not being the biggest fan of traditional card games, it transforms the genre into something all its own. It also boasts the one thing I think that defines a true game: anyone can have fun. It doesn’t matter your age, language, disability, etc. I encourage you to dive into the game with no reservations.

metacritic,KillerTeddyB3ar,balatro,"While it may not have pulled me into its mechanics as successfully as a game like Slay the Spire, where you constantly have to calculate not just your movement across the map, your damage output, and also the damage output of your enemies and how to deal with that in the best possible way, with all of that also being highly dependent on the character you choose to play. Balatro, just like StS, is still a basically endlessly replayable roguelike deckbuilder. Only this time you don't fight for your life against dozens of different enemies. You are instead met with a mix of poker mechanics, jokers that buff your deck, tarot cards that give numerous different buffs, planet cards that buff your hands, and the joy of opening card packs, all in the hopes that you manage to build a deck that will give you hundreds, thousands, if not even millions of points, sometimes in a single hand. There is beauty in the simplicity here, with the only thing you need to worry about being the score target at the end of each turn. Even if you don't manage to score enough points and lose, a round of Balatro shouldn't take you more than half an hour, which just screams **** that I will casually replay for years to come. And while I haven't played with every deck in the game just yet, I wish there were overall fewer decks, but that they changed up the gameplay more drastically than the ones we have in the game at this moment. So far my strategy of going for high-end full houses hasn't really met a whole lot of opposition (this may ofcourse change with higher difficulties and some later decks). Oh, and an option in the settings that would speed up the animations a bit would be highly appreciated.",8,10
metacritic,MidTakes4Me,balatro,"Balatro is my favorite rougue like game. Even if you don't care for or know how to play poker itreally doesn't take awat from the expereince. For this, I reference my girlfriend who put well over 100 hours into Balatro this year. The game loop is addicting and the more jokers you unlock the better you get at the game. The better you get at the game the higher stakes and different decks begin to provide the challenge. It's a game that gives back what you put into it and for $15 your not gonna find anything better in 2024.",10,10

metacritic,RomaNomak,balatro,"Знаете, вот каждый год выходит какая-то на первый взгляд невзрачная игра типа FTL: Faster Than Light, Loop Hero, Vampire Survivors или Brotato, которые имеет какую-то очень простую на первый взгляд кор-механику, но которая цепляет так, что игра не отпускает несколько часов подряд. И в этом году такой игрой для меня стала BALATRO. В основе лежат правила покера, где необходимо собирать карты в комбинации, типа флэш, стрит, карэ и т.д. Чем сложнее собранная рука, тем больше очков за нее ты получишь, а чтобы победить в раунде нужно собрать определенное их количество. Все просто, однако весь интерес кроется в том, что есть множество дополнительных способов умножить их. Например благодаря джокерам, модифицированным картам, картам Таро и фишкам. Все перечисленное является случайным и поэтому каждая новая партия уникальна и приходится подстраивать свою тактику игры под те условия, что на руках именно сейчас. Приходится много думать и планировать наперед и это очень сильно затягивает. Пожалуй в BALATRO самый уникальный геймплей из всех представленных в ролике, а может быть и среди всех игр, вышедших в этом году. Поэтому я рекомендую игру всем тем кто устал от всех этих экшенов и киношек, и хочет поиграть во что-то действительно новое и уникальное.",8,10
metacritic,AceXY,balatro,A really impressive first game from a single developer. Third best deckbuilding rogue like.,8,10
metacritic,Renzokuken,balatro,"Balatro is a really unique game that combines traditional poker, with rogue like deck building elements to create something truely unique. The presentation is barebones, but it has a unique style with it's jokers and use of transitioning audio. It's fairly cheap, available on mobile, or steam deck and it's got an endlessly playable quality in a similar vein to slay the spire, making it ideal for those moments you just have some time to kill.

My only complaint with the game is with it's boss blinds, which have unique abilities for example ""disable all hearts"" or disable a random joker"", some of which just straight up hard counter certain playstyles. The game randomly pushes you into a style of play, and it can feel particularly unfair to reach the end of a challenging run only to find the boss hard counters your otherwise winning deck. For example, if I randomly get stuff that buffs heart cards and I build around that, then a later boss disables all hearts. Feels terrible, in an otherwise enjoyable game.",8,10

metacritic,TheCoffeeTalker,balatro,"An absurdly addicting game. I genuinely cannot find a flaw within it. Some achievements may be hard, but they’re doable.

metacritic,Kairisan,balatro,"It's poker with extra heroine for the toilet break addicts. Calling this a video game is quite insulting to every other game that DOES have art, music and actual gameplay. Balatro is so immensely void of any added value, it can only pass as a cheap casino game or an early 2000's mobile game at it's very best. Just buy a deck of cards, it will have a ton more gameplay and will cost a lot cheaper. Nevertheless if you hate your job and you're seriously into toilet break games, I recommend Flappy Bird or Candy Crush, still a ton cheaper and both games had at least some effort put into them. Absolutely the very worst and most lazy cash grab game I have ever, EVER played.",1,10

metacritic,bradain,balatro,"Honestly I find people who review games lowly based upon their ""overhype,"" rather lame. It just makes reviewing a high-low game for developers where they want enough people to support the game to finance their endeavors but not too many as to get crucified by game snob reviewers. Anyways, now to the game. It's successful in its ability to be different with every play. I've seen other reviews that complain that it's just luck or compare it to being like pulling the lever of a slot machine, but that couldn't be further from the truth unless you're unable to think on your feet about which choices will mathematically benefit you the most. I find it ridiculous to complain about a game just because you don't have enough skill to see the skill it is based on. The aesthetics are charming and simple enough not to overwhelm ""non-gamers."" My only gripe is that although many mods exist for the game, its gameplay loop is generally unaltered after you unlock all gold on a deck and all the jokers (granted is typically a lot of playtime). Still, I'd like to see other modes or more than the 20 challenges in the game (which I'm sure the developer is working on).",9,10
metacritic,fossilfuel33,balatro,"Time to throw some cold water on the fervent crowd endlessly praising this game. 
First off, this game is in no way game of the year territory. It's a very basic rogue-like deck builder, with the most, and I mean THE MOST, bare bones artistic style and presentation I have ever seen.
But none of that really matters when gameplay is king. Unfortunately THIS gameplay is anything but. After only a few rounds you'll realize you simply need to reroll until you get a busted run where you simply dominate. Rinse and repeat.
Which is why I believe some people swear by this game. Starting a run is the equivalent to pulling the handle on a slot machine; you just want to see if you can get that jackpot. But with how long it takes to see if a run will work it just feels like a waste of time to me.",5,10
metacritic,nascent,balatro,"For those that love card games it's a must play. But the hype and praise for the game is excessive. The game is overly complex with little introduction.  There's standard cards, plasma cards, glass cards, steel cards, gold cards, nebula cards, tarot cards, planet cards, spectrak cards. Then there's lucky modifiers, enhanced modifiers, bonus modifiers.  Then there's seals, stamps, stickers, vouchers.  And finally there's jokers, many different types of jokers.  There might be more types as it's impossible to understand them all without committing a lot of time researching things by yourself outside of the game.
There's a brief introduction on your first play that is extremely basic and brief and absolutely nothing else after that point so you're completely on your own.

The concept of the game is you get a hand and you must play your hand to earn chips, and a certain number of chips will beat the level.  Each level (boss) has different handicaps placed on your hand to nerf your cards to make it harder.
The different types of card or modifiers affect your hand in other ways, mostly positively, sometimes negatively.
The idea is interesting, and the idea of ""permanent unlocks"" is most intriguing. Alas, despite the game repeatedly stating there are permanent unlocks.  Once you die, they're lost, and so the game gets incredibly grindy and repetitive.  Trying to find modifiers or cards that give you a chance of progressing before you lose them all again.  
Eventually I realised I just want to play traditional poker again.

Also, the game recently released on android, but has no optimizations for small screens so is incredibly difficult to play comfortably.  Best played on PC.",7,10

metacritic,msp99,balatro,Absolutly addicting rouge-like Pokergame. A lot of replay value. Despite the simple gameplay there is much content and many achievements.,9,10
metacritic,RandomGamer211,balatro,"Balatro has a simple concept. You earn points through a standard 52 card deck of playing cards. The higher the hand the better. For example, a flush will earn you more points than a two pair (like in standard poker games). Where the fun and addiction comes from is what you can do to your 52 card deck. Balatro uses a ""joker"" style system where different jokers can give you more points depending on what the joker adds to your score. For example, there are jokers that adds a multiplier to your hand. There are jokers that gives you more cards, and so on. Tarot cards also come into play as well as planet cards. Tarot cards change the way your deck looks. Planet cards will upgrade the hand that is listed on the planet card, which in turn gives you more points. This recipe of deck manipulation adds to the addiction and pleasure of this game. After playing this game for over 200 hours by now, I think this is one of the best games of 2024. The game is cheap, super fun, and highly addictive. Also I would add that any cheap PC can run this game. You don't need a high end PC to play it.",10,10

It's not hard to tell that this is a passion project, one which years have been invested into. It feels like there's more passion in this game then any AAA title in the recent years.

The exploring is fun. The building is fun. Every time you automate something, put hours into a factory, all of it is just so satisisfying. A game that never gets boring, never stagnates. You can pour hours into this game without even noticing.

I deducted one point because there are still some bugs and crashes. However, these are very rare and (except for the crashes) don't impact the gameplay. It's definitely not a buggy mess though, the bugs are very minor.

metacritic,nodlimax,satisfactory,"Satisfactory has its name well chosen because it is about building automated factories while being very satisfying once you see the result. The game starts pretty small with a decent introduction on how to do stuff. The basics are easily learned.

It then quickly starts to expand and provides a lot of things to explore and try out while never forcing you to rush anything. If you enjoy the creation of bigger and bigger production chains with various tools to additionally add buildings or transport goods from one place to another you'll likely have a good time here. It's like a puzzle game where you also use math to fit the pieces together and make it produce the desired numbers products.

There is one map that you can explore and exploit to your hearts content which has 4 different spawn points that will affect difficulty somewhat. There are a number of collectibles  which are all related to and useful for your production chains. It's not just for some silly achievement. Exploring actually provides something of value even though I'll also admit that times it can become somewhat tedious due to the sheer amount of things you can find and collect.

It is also important to mention that Satisfactory does not come with any additional cost. When you buy the game you get all of it. There are no Microtransactions which is always a big plus.

The game is designed with Co-op in mind meaning the core aspects somewhat are intended to be used with multiple people playing together. Still you can enjoy it solo as well. But even while playing solo the game somewhat behaves like an online server (you can't really pause the game through the game menu).

Satisfactory has some flaws though. As mentioned above some aspects in exploration as well as the construction can become somewhat tedious. Especially if you decide to start over on a new map having to search for a lot of the same things again to unlock specific recipes can become more of a nuisance than an exciting adventure. And the less exploration you do (especially early on) the more time you spent creating factories as the standard recipes especially for later products can be very resource and construction intense where you suddenly are supposed to build over a hundred production facilities with respective connections to get everything you need together. You can use blueprints to optimize that process somewhat but the size for these blueprints is limited and their usability often cumbersome. It's enough to build basic modules but very difficult to prepare entire factories. So the construction of factories can become a time consuming process - especially if you misjudge or misplace sections of your factory and have to start over or do extensive adjustments.

Still once you complete a project and you see exactly the number you expect to get (meaning your production chain runs optimal) then it is very satisfying to see.

One more aspect that I see somewhat critical are road vehicles. By default none of the maps have any roads. They are undeveloped worlds afterall. You can construct a number of vehicles to use in your playthroughs. All have different strengths and weaknesses. Some of them are intentionally designed to automatically transport goods around the world. The problem though is that without roads that becomes a bit of a tricky operation (the AI seems to have problems with path finding). So you may want to build roads. But the construction of roads is a pain to deal with as there are no good tools available for that. You'd have to create blueprints to cover that but even with blueprints creating roads with corners, ups and downs is very time consuming and annoying. The game has trains in it and building train tracks seems to be pretty good (which is why trains are the preferred transport option in later parts of the game). it doesn't have something like that for roads though. So there is no 2-way lane road pathing out of the box which is why are required to create your own modules and fiddle around with those. It's unfortunate and makes road vehicles limited in their usage but at least there is an option.

And if necessary you can always create conveyer belt spaghetti instead...

Anyway the game is fun to play even with its flaws. For the first playthrough it is recommended to do it without guides and explore it on your own. it's massive and will easily provide you with over a hundred hours of playtime without reaching the end of the game. I'm not sure on the replayability though because of some of the negative aspects brought up above. In the end it's a sandbox. So if you like playing with sand and build castles then go and have fun.",9,10
metacritic,Vehox,satisfactory,That's one of the best games I've played so far. You have so many things to do and you will never get bored. It makes even more fun with friends and you can let your imagination run wild. You will spend too much time on this game - believe me haha!,10,10

metacritic,Acalodo,satisfactory,"Satisfactory is a diverse game that has had me hooked on it since update 6 and have played over 150 hours of it either on my own or with friends. With 1.0 just releasing they have added several beneficial additions with lag. Overall if you like ""Satisfying"" games this is for you.

PS: If you don't like grinding this game probably isn't for you but then again what building game doesn't require grinding.",10,10
metacritic,kretas,satisfactory,"It's one of my favorite games in recent years. Building huge factories, troubleshooting, decorating, and optimizing them is deeply satisfying.

However, 1.0 is a bit of a disappointment; the added story feels cheap as it just doubled down on the already high amount of sarcasm . To summarize, there is ""Ada,"" a super-intelligent AI who makes sarcastic jokes, such as you exploiting the planet or how Ficsit doesn't care about the safety of pioneers. This could have been written by any generic large language model. At the same time, she has philosophy lessons with an alien being, which is most of the time just pseudo-smart gibberish.
Feels like it tries so hard to put perceived real life issues in a game where this has no outcome in a joking way only to insult the gamer spent time and intelligence.

TL;DR: I'd rather not have a story than a bad one. The rest of the game is truly amazing.",10,10

metacritic,SuppleZombieCat,satisfactory,"The game itself is really fun, but it was much better 2 years ago when it was released, mostly because it was much less buggy. It seems that all this time adding content caused game to be so unstable that it crashes every 5-60 minutes at random. It is really hard to enjoy any game this way. I cannot recommend this game with clear conscience before developers get it fixed properly.",3,10
metacritic,hathewj,satisfactory,"Personal note:  I am 56 years old and have been gaming continually since 1980-ish on my Atari and then my Commodore 64.  I have put out a review only a few times in my life, and this game deserves it.  Very few games have kept my attention more than Satisfactory.  There have been several times when I had to shut the game down because it was now 8 AM and I had to start work.  2000 plus hours so far and expect to double that before I am done. (I can't see me ever being done with this game actually.)

This game. Wow.
I have been playing Satisfactory since I ran into it in early access on Steam, where they had a decent promo video that was refreshingly fun, for lack of a better word.  I gave it a try and played for an hour or so, got a bit confused, and put it aside.
Then I kept seeing all these reviews and a quick tutorial that cleared up all my confusion and gave it another try.  I haven't stopped playing.  

You start out landing on a planet with no idea why you are there. All you know is you have to make parts for...something.
Once you get over the very minor learning curve you keep building and building,    It get more and more complex, but by the time it gets crazy complicated you have learned how it all works. and  you are ready for the next challenge.
During early access, there was no story line, only a few rumors about it.  The full release adds that story line in a way that is unintrusive.  It just flows into the game as you find more things by the regular commentary from ADA, you AI helper.


ADA brings back the feeling you had from Glados in Portal.  I am not even close to finishing the final release (I finished the EA stuff though), but ADA adds commentary as you unlock more and more items/skills/tools in the game, and you start to get an idea of what is going on, but still makes you think what you are doing may be a bad thing.
So, as you you collect/exploit resources (you can play by being thoughtful of the environment, or you can cover the whole place in concrete.  It is up to you), the game seamlessly compels you to explore, looking for more.  As you collect items they allow you to unlock more stuff and better ways to make parts.

The UI is genius.  It all works so well.  Even in EA it was very simple to figure out the basics.  After EA any minor UI issues I had were corrected by the devs.

The graphics are at AAA standards.  The way items you build are applies are awesome.  Wait till you see the space elevator get places.  It is beautiful.
The environment is beautiful as well.  There are multiple biomes that have been hand built.  Moving across the map ai amazing as you change areas.  While traveling through a desert it slowly changes to another biome.  Before you know it that desert is now a swampland, or a grassy plain, or a old growth forest, and several more.  It is something you have to see to believe.

I am ending it here since I want everyone to see it for themselves.  Watch a few youtube vids to see for yourself. This is SO much more than a simple building game.  I would have easily paid $60-$70 for this game (and I usually wait until price drops)  It is currently on sale for $36 on steam and worth much more than that IMO.

Do not miss out on this game.  It is worth every penny.  It was worth it halfway through EA and is now a bargain for what you get.

PS.  I forgot to mention the Devs.  These folks are so awesome and are devoted to the success of this game.  They are regularly online and are down to earth and have a fun snarky attitude.  Some of the best devs I have ever seen.  I am not kidding.  Also, the players are super cool and more than happy to help.  There are very good youtubers like Bitz and TotalXclipse and Kibbitz and many others that have awesome vids for build ideas and help/tutorials.  Also, the support on Reddit (r/SatisfactoryGame) that are more than happy to help and no one is rude.",10,10

It's basically open ended, you can play it at whatever speed you like while still being a challenge if you want to 'finish' it.  It's got massive replayability, and every playthrough teaches you something you swear you'll do better next time.

I've mentioned the graphics, but the sound design is fantastic too.  As a final cherry on top, it supports multiplayer and community modding, so just when you're getting bored of the built in stuff, you can mod it into a whole new experience.

metacritic,tihoxodka,satisfactory,"As someone typically uninterested in factory-building games, Satisfactory caught me off guard. This game masterfully blends relaxation with intricate industrialization, set against a breathtaking alien backdrop.

Key points:
* Visually stunning world begging to be explored
* Deeply satisfying progression from small outposts to massive complexes
* Packed with nuances and secrets that continually surprise
* Clever humor adds charm to the industrial grind

The attention to detail is impressive, from unique machine sounds to the mesmerizing flow of resources. Beyond factory building, you'll explore crash sites and face alien wildlife, adding variety to the gameplay. 
Satisfactory has earned a top spot in my gaming library, proving that great design can win over even skeptical players. Whether you're a genre fan or a newcomer, this game offers an addictive blend of optimization, exploration, and alien world-building that's hard to put down",10,10

metacritic,Aqua9F1sh,satisfactory,"The developers have succeeded in creating a very good factory simulation game. In which you can have a lot of fun creating factories and exploring the wonderful, hand-crafted map.  The game never gives you the feeling that you are under time pressure to finally start production. You can take all the time you want to plan or expand your production or explore the map in the meantime. A base defense mode has also been omitted so that the player can fully concentrate on expanding his factory and does not have to worry about building up a defense and maintaining it. Which, in my opinion, is not necessary for a game that simply wants to be a factory simulation in which it is about building factories and optimizing the processing **** developers give you the freedom to build the way you want. The limitations are reduced to a minimum. If you don't care that conveyor belts go through the ground or other buildings then you can do it in this game. There is only a hint that there will be optical collisions. This freedom allows you to develop freely in the design of your factories. Even after more than 1500 hours (in the Early Access version) I like to come back to this game to expand and optimize my factories or to start a new savegame to implement new ideas or designs without tearing down the previous savegame. The story in Satisfactory is rather secondary and is not necessary for progress and can be completely deactivated if you want. 

During the Early Access phase of the game, the developers were in close contact with the community and always explained their changes and listened to the needs of the community. Even if features requested by the community were not implemented in the game, there was an explanation as to why it was not done. Be it that it doesn't fit the narrative of the game or there are technical reasons that prevented it from being implemented in the game. But even in these rare cases, the developers at Coffee Satin communicated openly with the community and looked for solutions that worked for everyone. All in all, the developers have shown how Early Access should work.",10,10

metacritic,Tortor,monster-hunter-wilds,"Too easy, and I'm not even a fan of difficult games. I bought the deluxe of this game so excited because of my experience with Monster Hunter World was so amazing. So I really went into this as a super fan. 

This game overall though is so easy that it's oh most a 'cozy' game to me now. It's so mindless and really lacks letting you feel part of the world. 

There is no investigating, no tracking, barely any walking and the monsters with the new weak spot mechanics are easier then ever to topple. I didn't die once through the entire campaign and even through High Rank 50. Not once. Sometimes I feel like the game plays itself.

It plays itself because your mount takes you everywhere you need to be, barely a need to even know where the monsters hang out  or any familiarity with the map. It plays itself because the weak spots tell you exactly where to hit in a bright red highlight. It plays itself because all monsters are visible and unlocked on the map. It plays itself because the scout flies tell you what to loot and gives you an obnoxious amount of information to hand hold you.

You are not allowed to discover anything on your own it feels like. It's mind numbing. As soon as the monster runs away, it runs like 30 feet away, barely causing any tension to feel like it means anything. If it does run far, your mount is so far that it really serves as a fancy loading screen to mount up and sharpen while it takes you exactly to where it's going. 

This literally feels like an arena fighter now, just being dragged to fight and told how to fight and where to hit, so even that's not fun anymore.

The monsters dont stick out as anything over the top. I remember the Elder Dragons in MHW and just being so fascinated with how epic they were built up to be and getting stomped a few times figuring out it's pattern and building up to defeat them. 
None of the monster here needed any sort of critical thinking, any new monster, my build felt meaningless as if i just kept upgrading to whatever is next in rarity, who cares what it is, I can take it down even if I never me the monster before.

The biomes also feel so similar to eachother. Occassionally the weather changes things up which is cool but nothing stands out so much as everything is so interconnected. Also because of how hand holdy the auto running to the monster is, none of the biomes stick out as 'the biome where this monster is found' because you really dont focus in long enough to care. Even by the time HR comes around, nothing feels strange about a monster being in a different place because you barely notice.

The tent system is meaningless, you can have tents out and the time needed to figure out what tent to use takes longer then to just auto run. The monsters go down so fast, you also dont have a lot of time to spare.

The fighting feels so button mashy and reliant on hitting weakspots. I remember how absolutly cool it was to get a monster to fall over in MHW, but here, they fall over all the time because you have these giant areas telling you where and when it's expected to fall over, it loses it's appeal.

This game lost a lot of it's charm trying to appeal to too many people by going too far trying to be accessible and took away so many responsibilities that made the game have tension. Nothing is a challenge now and I barely feel like I'm doing anything on my own or discovering anything cool. 
It's not rewarding, for how much easier the game was, the consumables were not weakened, leaving them now overly powerful when compared to how easy the monsters are now.

I'm so disappointed and after the money I spent, I wont be returning to this franchise, this game wasn't made for fans of the series or for people who like this style of game. This game was made for people who want a cozy game which leaves prior fans out in the cold who were hoping for a similar Monster Hunter Experience.",4,10

As for the monsters, they are a bit easier by my opinion (in the main story) than World's but harder than Rise's. Still very fun fights. The story is a bit uninterested but not bad. The optimize is the only problem based on most people, but while definetely poor, it's not ruining the game. I highly recommend it.

metacritic,rybkinrolla,monster-hunter-wilds,"One thing that I liked about this game - it's pretty addictive. You want to kill another monster after you've just killed one, to craft another armor or weapon, after you've just crafted one. That's it, no more positives. Moreover I don't know why so many critics highly rated this game, probably someone had a good bribing list. Now let's talk about negatives: 1. The story is too bad, as well as characters. 2. Performance is a joke. I played it on PS5 Pro in performance mode and I assume my fps was around 50, despite it's the same ReEngine with graphics of PS4. Some of the textures in cinematics, especially on clothes were looking like in Quake 2, just a bunch of pixels. 3. Most of the stuff you have in the game is useless. Like you have a barrel with 250 damage, but you need time to place it and lure a monster onto it. Within this time wasted, you would do more damage with your main weapon. 4. User interface is too bad as well, they put so much effort into editing hunter profile, but during a fight, operating with all those rings was a horrible experience.",5,10
metacritic,Piggyx,monster-hunter-wilds,As a newcomer to the series it's a really nice experience going into the hunts and being welcome to the community. The game is stunning and keeps you engaged.

metacritic,Captiosus,monster-hunter-wilds,"Story is laughably bad. Performance is horrendous on any of the available graphical settings (and performance mode looks like a last gen game). Gameplay has been dumbed down to the point where chunks of the game might as well play themselves; The mount (Seikret) auto follows monsters unless you disable multiple buried settings, the game will auto gather things, crafting has been completely lobotomized, and the combat loop has also been made id-10-T proof. The monsters are boring and predictable and ""end game"" is meager. Anyone giving this higher than a 7 is full of it.",6,10

metacritic,justinb113,monster-hunter-wilds,"Loving this game, playing onPS5, 40 FPS balanced mode with some graphic settings I found online.  Looks great and plays fine.

So far at 30 hours and halfway through the story it’s quite a bit easier than world but I am a lot better than I was when I played world.  I’m still finding a lot of fun in the fights.

I saw some of the negative reviews say it feels like world and it does but to me this is a good thing, I don’t think fans would want them to change it that much.  I think there’s been some nice additions like the mount and weapon switching and the new monsters have much more variety to them.  But essentially it’s just monster hunter and I love monster hunter so this is pretty much what I wanted.

I do think story mode takes a little long, too much walking and cutscenes to introduce every single monster but it’s better than worlds story mode was and the npc cast aren’t nearly as annoying this time.  The handler is so much better.  That being said I’m not sure we need such a long story mode, and if we do it would be better if they added some edge to it - you never feel any of the characters is going to die etc.  They’re going for a big cinematic feel but the story is just too safe for that.  If they want to rival the good JRPGs then there needs to be higher stakes in the story.  But still, the main event of this game is hunting the monsters and that’s great from what I can see.  Loved the spider, thunder dragon and the octopus so far.",9,10

metacritic,phantomcritic1,monster-hunter-wilds,"Fantastic and revamped gameplay, subpar visuals, horrible UI and inventory system, and boring story. If you're new to Monster Hunter, then this game will be very enjoyable for you. If you're a veteran Monster Hunter fan, well... you’ll like the gameplay at least. To start off, gameplay is amazing. Combat is smoother and more sophisticated than ever. New mechanics like adding ""wounds"" on monsters gives players the opportunity to deal even heavier damages. Power clashes give that cinematic feeling of going toe-to-toe with a monster multiple times your weight. However, the UI and inventory system is atrocious. The game does a poor job at implementing a seamless menu and inventory, nor does it teach you how to navigate through it. I spent my entire playthrough utilizing only 60% of my items, slinger ammos, etc. because I still had no clue how to navigate between them.  When it comes to armor sets, most of the designs were dissapointing. I recall liking only one or two of the armor sets in the game. The rest of them just looked either downright goofy or subpar. While I do appreciate the array of new monsters introduced in the game, the design of their armor sets just didn't click with me. While the addition of having two gendered versions of the armor is great, it would have been nice if the armor designs looked good as well.  For many MH veterans, the addition of a mount is an absolute game-changer... or at least, if it was done properly. MH Wilds introduces these creatures called ""Seikret,"" bird-like mounts that somewhat resemble a cross between a velociraptor and a chocobo from Final Fantasy. With larger open-world maps, Seikret will be your main form of transportation in this game. They will allow you to cross distances within a shorter period than if you walked. And because the maps are larger, the game sometimes forces you to mount your Seikret due to areas inaccessible while walking. What I hated about Seikret-riding was the god-awful handholding. You'd think having your own mount will give you liberty to control movement as you wish. No. The maps are specifically designed so that you're forced to let go of your controls and let the Seikret ""auto"" move for you - jumping through rocks, hopping through meticulously designed pathways, and moving through terrain that was specifically designed for Seikret. It absolutely **** considering how terrible the 3D feature on the map is. So, you have no choice but to let the Seikret auto-pilot you to your marked location - because you have no clue how to get there with the horribly designed map. The only time you have most control over your Seikret is during monster fights at open ground. Otherwise, ""screw you. Don't walk. Use your Seikret and let it auto-pilot you to point B like how we designed the map to do so."" What's the point of a bigger map if most areas are discriminatory towards walking? Graphics-wise, everything looks mid. There's barely any graphical or visual improvement from Monster Hunter Worlds. Due to how poorly optimized this game is, the visuals outside of cutscenes look terrible. Textures on clothing look terrible and colors look washed out. To put things in perspective, I'm running this game on and a 20 gig vram 7900xt GPU with FSR on and graphics set to 1440p ultra. It still looks bad.   Now let's discuss the elephant in the room - the story. The story is boring, and the characters aren't very engaging. While I appreciate Capcom doubling-down on story-elements compared to Monster Hunter Worlds, the game felt like it was pushing cutscenes after cutscenes down your throat. There are too many cutscenes in this game, and each one takes longer than it needed to be. I don't mind long cutscenes so long as I'm invested in the story and characters. Unfortunately, the plot starts out very slow, and it only picks up a little bit towards the mid-half of the game. Aside from you and the MH guild, this game introduces like three separate factions of people with barely enough time to explain all of them. And each faction has its set of characters whose individual personalities, backstories, and purpose are overshadowed by the overarching plot to “figure out the mystery behind Nata’s people.” You have dozens of these characters from different villages, cultures, and civilizations; however, you never get invested in them. Because the story just uses them as plot progression for Nata’s story. I'd say Nata, the main plot tool of the game, is the worst of them all. I absolutely hated Nata. I hated the writing and voice acting done on this child. Everything he said felt so cringe and annoying. There was never any moment where I fully invested in Nata's own story and personality. He wasn't even crucial to the story. He was just there. Yet he’s somehow the focal point of the plot. I hated how everybody just kept babying him, even when he does something absolutely stupid at some point during the story.

Overall, it's a mid game.",7,10

Tons of great weapon options and combat mechanics that made every fight tactical and exciting. The world looked and felt great, tons of good loot to chase and craft. My main critiques of the game that kept it from being amazing or perfect is the weak and boring story, the maps themselves could have been a bit bigger, and too much level locking. The story just felt like a generic story crafted by ChatGPT or something, no real plot or development of the characters, could have been way better in my opinion. Once you get to endgame, it really feels like the training wheels come off and you can actually raise your hunter rank, craft legendary armor, free roam throughout the whole world. Before that, you are kind of stuck in low levels, in the same areas, and forced to use weak armor and weapons for the first 20 hours of the game. Still a fun experience despite everything, definitely recommend people to try.",8,10

metacritic,aitorsibo,stellaris,"One of the best strategy/simulation games out there. If you like growing and managing your civilization, discovering new stuff, and building an army to take on the galaxy this is it. It’s deep, complex and rewarding when played right. It may have a steep learning curve, and have an improvable base UI, but that’s where the workshop comes in. This game supports the Steam Workshop and is full of great mods, so be sure to give it a shot. As many other simulation games like Civ, it grows more tiresome as the game advances and your civilization grows, so If you don’t love to micro-manage a lot, do not expand too much or give a try to automatization. I really like managing short-mid and long term plans, and advancing steadily in those. The game will require you to have an eye on each one. I really like the lore built into the many different questlines. The endgame crisis is ok for me. What’s not ok and I’d rather have disabled is the fallen empires setting. Spawn 1, or none. If 2 are present, chances are a “holy war” will break out late in the game and screw the galaxy, having the endgame crisis just around the corner.I absolutely love creating my own empire, race. I can define how the species is and how it behaves through lots of characteristics, and also define how its government works. With mods, you can expand further the customization options and add a shipset from Mass Effect, for example. Roleplaying is fun and advised. You can also create your own ship designs, and build fleets using many of each. RTS battles are fine but not the focus. That’s fine, as building up your fleet and planning is the important part, not the battle per se (although there are many booms and flashes for you to **** game has improved a lot over the years, and is still being supported with new expansions/DLCs.

metacritic,kamil0101,stellaris,"An interesting game to play on the Xbox Game Pass for a few afternoons, but not much longer than that. It was fun figuring the game out, peeling off more and more layers of the game mechanics, then managing planets, assigning planets' ""pops"" to jobs in order optimise various outputs. But after working this out and winning a few systems in my first ever war, I did not see a reason why I should keep on playing. I already knew what the game would be like: a ""rinse and repeat"" cycle of optimising resource output, upgrading fleets, waiting for the truce to expire before winning a couple more meaningless systems in another meaningless war.

A major problem with this game is its theme: there is none. The sci-fi veneer is quite poor.

We know nothing about the species that are available to play, there is no story, they are completely random (in fact, I believe they *can* be randomised). Which makes interaction with AI opponents a dull affair, in which you only care about their strength relative to yours.

The systems are all pretty much identical except for their resource output and the colour of the star, so I explore them only because I have to, not because I'm genuinely interested to find out what's round the corner (first encounter events were fun though). It is different from other comparable games: in Civilization, for instance, discovering edges of the continent, strategic resources, natural wonders, city-states all matters and makes exploration interesting. In Europa Universalis or its spin-offs like Crusader Kings you don't really discover anything but you play on the real world map, which adds meaning to your conquests: it's more fun to say ""I conquered France"" than ""I won 6 star systems, all identical and randomly generated"". It doesn't help that planets suitable for colonisation are fairly rare and a great majority of systems are empty points on the map which you can't do anything interesting with, other than mine them for resources.

The game is horrifically time consuming. I did not finish my game, I abandoned it in what I believe was early mid-game, to which point I got after spending maybe 15 hours. You could finish a infamously lengthy RPG game like The Witcher 3 or watch all 11 seasons of Modern Family in the time at this rate it takes to finish a single game of Stellaris.

It is deep, strategic, with the emotion of exploring the stars and building a civilization that I did not have since Galactic Civilizations (one and two).
Stellaris is much better of course, given how old that game is now.
Although less important to me, it also has great graphics, music and sound effects.

You cannot control almost anything during the battle.
At first I thought that was a limitation, coming from Sins of a solar empire, but now I like it because the fun is being able to build the fleets and defenses, and to decide where to employ them.

Besides, this game is much more strategic than Sins of a solar empire, and I am not sure anymore that manually controlling the ships would be a plus.",10,10
metacritic,Scalzo98,stellaris,"Its a fantastic game that has depths that require quite the learning curve. But once you master it you can become what ever kind of empire you could ever dream of.

metacritic,Inari_Acolyte,stellaris,"A good sci-fi 4X game with a wide breadth of mechanics, playstyles, and replayability. This game is enjoyable despite the regular changes to its base mechanics, prevalent tech issues, and mediocre AI.

metacritic,jdmsjmsrscgm,payday-2,"PayDay 2, is a cooperative first-person shooter that plunges players into the thrilling world of high-stakes heists. Since its release in 2013, PayDay 2 has maintained a dedicated fanbase and received numerous updates, making it a robust and evolving experience.Players form a crew of up to four members, each taking on different roles to execute elaborate heists. Whether you're robbing banks, cooking meth, or pulling off art heists, teamwork is essential. The game rewards strategic planning and communication, making each successful heist a satisfying and exhilarating experience.

The variety of missions and heist scenarios is impressive. PayDay 2 offers a wide range of objectives, from stealthy infiltrations to all-out shootouts. This variety keeps the gameplay fresh and engaging, as no two heists feel the same. The game's extensive customization options also add to its depth. Players can choose from an array of weapons, equipment, and character skills, tailoring their loadouts to suit their preferred playstyle.

Visually, PayDay 2 may not be cutting-edge by modern standards, but it has a distinct and gritty art style that suits its urban crime setting. The sound design is another highlight, with a dynamic soundtrack that ramps up the tension during heists and solid voice acting that adds personality to the game's colorful cast of characters.",5,10

metacritic,Kaz__,payday-2,"It's an incredibly fun game, the gameplay is, as far as I'm concerned, 100% replayable. some heists get tough but I really think that's just how games like this should be. My only problem with the game, and it really is to a fault, is the amount of bugs and unfixed/unfixable problems (because of the games engine) while sometimes they're funny, and most of the time not game breaking it's still absurd for any game with an average player base of 10,000+ to have this many.

All that being said, I cannot recommend this game enough for the fun experiences I've had, without them, I can say for certain this game wouldn't have made it past a 7 in this review. You should buy this game, when you do though I'd recommend getting the legacy collection too (its $10 extra and it gives you a lot more content, ~35 dlcs) all the other DLCs are kinda boring and not worth the price.

All in all, get the game (maybe when it's on sale for $0.99) see if it's your thing, and decide for yourself what you want.",9,10

metacritic,MrRecorder2008,payday-2,"Payday 2, released in 2013, is a multiplayer first-person shooter that places players in the shoes of hardened criminals, orchestrating and executing elaborate heists. This cooperative crime spree delivers high-octane action, intense teamwork, and a thrill of pulling off the perfect job. While it has seen its fair share of ups and downs over the years, it remains a solid and entertaining co-op experience. One of Payday 2's strongest assets is its emphasis on teamwork and coordination. Players take on various roles within their criminal crew, such as mastermind, technician, enforcer, or ghost, each with unique abilities and equipment. Success hinges on the synergy of the team and careful planning before diving into the heist. The game offers a wide variety of heists, ranging from small-scale bank robberies to complex, multi-day jobs involving everything from art heists to drug deals gone wrong. The freedom to approach each job in different ways and the unpredictability of each mission keep the gameplay fresh and exciting. The gunplay in Payday 2 is solid, with a wide selection of firearms and modifications to choose from. Players can customize their loadouts to suit their preferred playstyle, whether it's going in guns blazing or taking a more stealthy approach. The progression system allows players to unlock new weapons, equipment, and skills as they gain experience. Payday 2's character customization options are extensive, allowing players to create unique criminals and heisters. The mask system, in particular, encourages creativity, and the ability to personalize your criminal persona adds a layer of personality to the game. However, Payday 2 has faced criticism over the years for issues such as balance problems, bugs, and controversial microtransactions. While many of these issues have been addressed by the developers, they can still affect the overall experience, and some players may find it frustrating. The game's visuals, while serviceable, may feel dated compared to more recent titles, but this is offset by the engaging gameplay and cooperative elements. The sound design, voice acting, and dynamic music contribute to the immersive experience. In conclusion, Payday 2 is a thrilling multiplayer heist game that shines brightest when played with a group of friends. Its emphasis on teamwork, variety of heists, and customization options make it a compelling choice for fans of cooperative shooters. While it has had its share of issues over the years, the core gameplay remains engaging and enjoyable.",8,10

metacritic,sansbattle1111,payday-2,"Payday 2, developed by Overkill Software, is an intense cooperative first-person shooter that puts players in the shoes of professional criminals executing high-stakes heists. With its addictive gameplay, strategic depth, and a wealth of content, this game offers a thrilling and immersive experience that shines brightest when played with friends.

The core of Payday 2 lies in its cooperative gameplay. Players can team up with friends or join a group of strangers to execute elaborate heists. Communication and coordination are key, as players must work together to complete objectives, manage hostages, and fend off waves of law enforcement. The sense of teamwork and camaraderie is exhilarating, and the game rewards players for effectively executing heists while minimizing collateral damage.

The variety of heists in Payday 2 is impressive. From bank robberies and jewelry store heists to complex, multi-day operations, each mission offers a unique set of challenges and objectives. The game provides multiple approaches and strategies for completing heists, allowing players to choose between stealthy approaches or going in guns blazing. The branching skill tree and customizable loadouts offer further depth and flexibility, encouraging players to experiment with different playstyles.

The progression system in Payday 2 is addictive and rewarding. Players earn experience points and cash from successful heists, which can be used to unlock new weapons, equipment, and skill upgrades. The constant sense of progression and the allure of unlocking new abilities and gear provide a satisfying incentive to keep playing and improving.

The game's presentation is solid, with detailed environments and a gritty art style that suits the theme of criminal activities. The sound design is particularly impressive, with realistic weapon sounds, dynamic music that ramps up during intense moments, and the tense chatter of law enforcement on the radio. The overall audiovisual package creates an immersive atmosphere that adds to the tension and excitement of the heists.

While Payday 2 provides a thrilling cooperative experience, it does have a few drawbacks. The AI-controlled teammates, while serviceable, may not match the level of coordination and reliability offered by human players. The game's difficulty curve can be steep, and some heists may require trial and error to master, which can lead to occasional frustration. Additionally, the game's performance and optimization can be inconsistent at times, impacting the overall experience.

Payday 2 is an engaging and addictive cooperative shooter that truly shines when played with friends. The strategic depth, variety of heists, and rewarding progression system make it a standout title in the genre. The immersive atmosphere and satisfying gameplay mechanics create intense and memorable moments. While it has a few flaws, Payday 2 offers a thrilling heist experience that will keep players coming back for more. It earns a solid 8/10 rating for its cooperative gameplay, strategic depth, and replay value.",8,10

metacritic,Greg_,payday-2,"Payday 2 is one of the best co-op Fps games up there with L4D2 in my eyes.

As the name suggests your trying to get your payday by robbing stores, ripping off dealers, printing money, and even making meth.

You do almost everything illegally in order to make money in various different missions
with there own unique maps and dialog. However most of the appeal in this game comes from the seemingly endless possibilities with the skill tree.

I'm sure if you've played more then 2 videogames you know what a skill tree is so ill just tell you the interesting part, the way you build your heister completely changes your style of play its no **** watchdogs skill tree.

For example you can have 4 sentries and turn the game into tower defense or you could not even engage with the cops and go all in on stealth, personally I use a LMG playstyle.

This game really shines with more then one person as most co-op games do its just not as fun solo
The lack of online voicechat really dose make it a ""Play it with your friends"" type of game.

I should also mention this game is very old and runs on a BAD game engine you will experience a little bug every now and then even in stealth mode.

I should also mention this game has a limited amount of Heists/missions but I still managed to get 100+ hrs out of the game but if doing the same heist over and over seems boring to you this isn't your game.

Also the ports **** only play it on PC.

Overall fun with friends, adds replayability through the skill tree, Minor bugs, Good gameplay loop.

After 7.5 years with this game, I can confidently say, I've lost no enthusiasm neither towards the gameplay nor towards the amazing music. It's a co-op game that just keeps you and your friends coming back for more.
The developer always came through with new ideas throughout the years, to keep the community entertained and playing, even after that mentioned incident, kudos to them.
Really a labor of love, and the maximum effort one can make out of an old racing game engine.

metacritic,marijn2112,payday-2,"A very replay-able action game with good mods available, the game is frequently on sale, including its DLC at a good price for its long playtime potential.
What frustrates me most is the developers', OVERKILL's, behavior partially towards its community while it pretends that working with the community is one of its main focuses:
-Overkill has repeatedly claimed that its updates were motivated by the community even when clearly not the case, as in with CrimeFest 2015's attempt of implementing lootboxes or most rebalances.
-The newer heists, released in paid DLC have generally been well designed but not optimised at all, the community has released several mods for this, showing clearly Overkill just didn't put effort into it.
-Overkill's community management is generally poor and inconsistent, I got banned, appealed and the moderator blocked me before I could even respond to the blatantly false allegations.
-Overkill has put little effort into working with its large modding community in enhancing their experience or reducing the amount of blatant cheat mods.

Meanwhile PAYDAY's community has probably made thousands of mods fixing bugs, adding maps and guns, rebalancing or overhauling its game mechanics, while most mods are not that major, the game can still be made a lot more replay-able.

Overall the game is still fun and still has its great replay-ability, but Overkill generally hasn't really improved the game in a long time.",7,10

metacritic,MrPajamas,payday-2,"PAYDAY 2 ... what wonderful memories. I only played number one for a few hours, but number two for a few hundred hours. The game is much better than the previous one. Better missions, of which there are more. Great music also applies here. But where the game has made the most progress is the customization of weapons. At number one, after a while I started to feel like I had nothing to do with my money. This will not happen to you here, because even after reaching level 100, you have the opportunity to enter the infam, which is ingenious. There are 25 infams in the game and it will take some time to get. The graphics are better than number one, but again nothing breathtaking. But it looks good, except for some blurred objects in the distance. As I mentioned in my review of Left 4 Dead 2, this also applies to graphics here. Better worse, but with the fact that it will also reduce HW requirements and the game can be played by more people. You have a choice of masks, armor, weapons and especially those weapons where the biggest stumbling block is. There are several DLCs in the game, which will not allow you to take the delicious minigun right in front of your eyes, with which you can mow one poem. So if you want to taste this delicacy, you have to reach into your wallet. Although not deep, such a minigun was just an example and in the game the DLCs together are really a hill, so if you want all the content, you will unfortunately have to pay extra. I'm really sorry. Don't worry, the game is one of the best multiplayer games I've ever played, although it still is, so what the game crashes are DLC. Maps have also undergone a change for the better. There are a lot of memorable missions, but again they are not part of the game. The only luck is that if your friend already owns the DLC maps and will be kind and invite you, then you can join in and not own the DLC. Despite the DLC, it's a great game for me and one of the best multiplayers I've ever experienced. I don't know if the game is still being played at this time, what I'm writing a review, but if you have a friend or best friends and create your own crew in the form of four players, you have a long way to level and fight for who will be the best thief of all dob. But I probably wouldn't start playing myself today.",8,10
metacritic,Demiurge11,payday-2,This game is simply awful. The tutorials to learn how to play are super glitchy and fail constantly. The interface is unintuitive. It's really confusing. The first mission out is robbing the bank and 300 cops throwing themselves at you. You have to run past police snipers to throw your cash in a van and drive away while the cops sit around and wonder where you went. It's just AWFUL. Thank goodness I got this one as a freebie.,0,10
metacritic,Asdi144,payday-2,"Really good game with a pretty decent replay value, but it has it's flaws.

/// Good Things ///

- Gameplay.

I like it, i'm seriously not a big fan of those ""mindless shooters"" where you have a big gon and shoot thousands of enemies, but PAYDAY is a exception for this, i just think that it's done good here. I also really enjoy character perk decks and abilities in the game, it adds SO MUCH, it gives so many options to play; Wanna run around super fast whilst killing everything that moves while also wielding akimbo shotguns? you can do this, maybe you really like melee combat, and really want to kill someone with a **** toothbrush? why not! and maybe you don't want to fight at all, but rather make your enemy surrender, and then convert them so they can fight on your side just like some infamous polish youtuber did? hell yeah, you can.

Speaking of combat, i need to say that it is pretty good there, although feels a little bit stiff, in the base game you have a good-enough arsenal of weapons, Assault rifles, SMG's, shotguns and some ""special"" weapons, and it is enough for the base game, what i also really like is the fact that you can modify them however you like, WHICH I ABSOLUTELY ADORE, like **** it may not be as good as in other games (i heard that tarkov's weapon mod system is just broken) but i do enjoy it.
Although, there's one thing i don't really like about the weapons in this game, as they feel kinda... boring, to say the least, like when shooting them i barerly feel the recoil, and well, there is recoil, and it definetly makes your aiming job harder, but it feels just wrong, it hits way too weak and just makes you drag your mouse down, very slowly in fact.

Oh, and the heists, they are mostly arlright, from your average bank heists to straight up stealing goats from across the street, there are some really good ideas thrown here, but the way they are made are often bad, like it's almost always the same thing, and i mean:
1. drill/saw a container that has valuable stuff
1.5 shoot stuff
2. steal it
2.5 shoot stuff
3. run for your **** lifes

- Graphics

Graphics in this game are just... okay,  they aren't perfect, but they don't make your eyes bleed too, character design is pretty flippin' good too, especially the enemies', like **** you can't tell me that Cloakers and Bulldozers don't look awesome.

- Voice Acting

Voice acting in this game is literal coinflip, there are characters that have just AMAZING voicelines and there are some that well... are f-ing recycled from top to the bottom. And i'm quite surprised about this one, as Enemy voicelines are absolute GOLD; they are creative and funny, yet you barerly hear even 20% of them, and Player Character quotes are well... MF'in terrible, most of them are literally the same garbage but with a new tone, it's always the same ""ENEMI CLOCKER SPOTTED!!111!1"" or ""x ENEMY DOWN"", which sound just bad and uninspired imo, they sound llke the voice actors played the characters purerly for the so-called ""PAYDAY"" (fun fact, Ron Perlman who voiced Rust did exactly that) not to mention that you need to hear the same quotes on repeat for the next 200 hours if you really want to complete the game, like jesus christ, why.

- Soundtrack

PAYDAY's soundtrack is without a doubt, a banger, and i mean SURE, it is your average boring 1 2 3 drop big room house stuff that sounds like there was a **** template ued while making it (and there probably was a one!) but at the same time, it's just good, like good, it fits so perfectly with the gameplay, it gives you that odd ""feeling"" when the drop hits very Mord Fustangin' hard when you're about to kill like the entire Secret Service, my personal favorites are Razormind and Evil Eye.

/// The BAD Things ///

- Microtransactions and DLC

I think that everyone heard about this one

Imo, loot boxes USED to be a pretty big f-in problem in this game, and i can't really how much exactly, as i never really played this game before 2020 but i can say that in 2021, they're not a big problem, especially seeing old reviews and videos about this game, they are still there but they don't change the game much, and i mean SURE, there are some expensive skins that may change the gun stats a little bit, but they're not a big problem as this game is a PVE CO-OP, and not a PVP one, so there is barerly any P2W for sure.

And there are DLC's to this game, and well, they are actually, decent-size problem, but i think that it's not as bad as people say, like sure, there are a **** of them but they're not that expensive, not to mention that the game itself on sale is like 1$ and the legacy collection on sale is like 20$, which in my opinion is a steal for that type of game.

/// In Conclusion: ///

metacritic,Kirbx,payday-2,"Payday 2 is a fast paced FPS where you play as a heister in the PAYDAY Gang, a group of criminals who rob banks, jewelry stores, and mercenary organizations. To say this game is perfect would be such a blatant lie, there's glitches left and right, it has dozens of DLC, and was released in 2013, which shows. But despite this, I would say this is one of the greatest games of 2010-2019. Not only can the game and nearly all of the DLC be purchased in a bundle for 20 dollars on sale, but the scale of this game is staggering. 66 unique heists, a ridiculous amount of different weapons, and just... so many masks. I notice so many people claiming the game has microtransactions, however there are no microtransactions anywhere. Just the DLC that you can get for 20 bucks, and increases the longevity of the game tenfold. Now I'm definitely biased, because I've sunk more time into this game than I would like to admit, but this game is just fun, plain and simple. If you bring along some pals, it can be some of the stupidest fun you could ever have. I can't stress this enough, if you have the money to spend, get this game.

It also had a good stealth side to the game, I just never explored it much.

Team work felt rewarding and there was always stuff to unlock and customize so it kept me coming back for ages, good soundtrack and thought-out characters. I feel like they added a bit too much stuff though as it was scary going back on after long periods of time because of all the changes. Some would see that as a plus.

I did buy a few cosmetic DLCs and to be honest I wasn't aware at the time about all the promises Overkill had made to the fans, and the harm that it had done to the fanbase. But it was visible how less and less players were connecting, and how imbalanced it had become.

metacritic,Baltifru,payday-2,"It is very difficult to express in a few words my feelings about Payday 2.

It is undeniably an excellent game, and an absolute blast if you play it with up to three of your friends. The mixture between intense FPS action and stealth phases is well thought and really encourages thinking before acting and building your equipment accordingly. The customization of your gears and talent tree are really impactful; there is a lot of variety between all the missions available. After 800 hours of play, I am not bored of playing this game which is constantly proposing new challenges.

So why would it be problematic for me to recommend such an original and amazing game ? Well, selling so many DLCs is not an economic model I want to encourage. DLCs are a good way of updating a game, but selling character packs (which are essentially cosmetics, in a non-PVP game !) for five bucks just isn't acceptable to me. Heists DLCs are much more worth the money, and still I think it would make much more sense to have fewer DLCs with more heists, rather than having to buy the game in a kit of 50 pieces. On top of that came the useless micro transactions, which developers initially declared they would never implement...

My conclusion: excellent and original game, and a complete blast with friends. Buy the ultimate edition, but don't waste too much money on the micro transactions and the other DLCs.",8,10

metacritic,Insidia_,delta-force,"I, as a player, who reached the highest rank, consider it my duty to write a precaution review for this horror ****.

The game has a nice weapon customization system, interesting operator abilities and good optimization. These where the good things about this game end.

The warfare game mode:
The game mode's matchmaking is horrendous, <70% of warfare lobbies are infested with quake-level unfair bots that many players mistake for cheaters, in reality there are few people you're getting queued with and a chance of encountering a real human cheater is fairly low. These make it absolutely unplayable unless you're a pro level FPS gamer. If you're seeking for challenges and want to humble your FPS shooter abilities, that game mode is for you.
The maps. O-o-oh, the maps here are what will be haunting your dreams for a long time. The shafted map. If you're being unlucky you'll get queued on it. Just leave it as soon as you enter the match, cause if you stay then welcome to a blowing-up simulator: there are few narrow passages that half of the lobby tries squeezing through while being barraged with explosives and bullets through smoke clouds. 90% of the time you and the whole lobby just stand next to these 3 passages throwing explosives. The threshold map is almost the same except for standing next to narrow passages and throwing explosives take only 70% of the time. The other 3 maps are widely open - you get constantly shot by multiple bot-snipers. At least here you can have some gun fights with bots and occasionally humans. Good luck.

The operations game mode:
That is where all the cheaters and most of the real human players dwell. This game mode is way more playable than the warfare one unless you try going into key-restricted locations with the best loot - the most common place to find cheaters. If you're satisfied with regular loot locations then you should try it. Overall, nothing special about this game mode, maybe only operator abilities make it stand out from any other extraction FPS game, but all other aspects are fairly casual.

The FPS mechanics like drop-shooting and sideway inclining are implemented horribly. Drop shooting doesn't take away your ability to precisely aim at the same time, so abusing it is a common thing to do.
The sound is terrible, makes it hard to detect someone. Sometimes you don't even hear somebody's coming until he is 5m away from you.
Net code is garbage, sometimes it actually breaks apart so you can hardly kill anybody.

A few final words about the matchmaking:
Keep in mind that there is a system that keeps your win rate at 50%, that means that sometimes you'll be thrown in a full-bot lobbies that you will inevitably lose. Also ranked and unranked matches are the same thing in this game. You'll get queued in the same lobby with ranked and unranked players. Your rating doesn't affect your lobbies at all: recruits and marshals get queued in the same lobbies.

Conclusion:
There are many more flaws I could've described, but it would hit the limit allowed. That how horrible this game is. The game puts you in impossible situations and pushes your limits. The game is to be considered an FPS shooting trainer for high-skilled players, not a game to enjoy. DO NOT PLAY IT if you're a casual player and want a fair competition.",1,10
metacritic,tyrpyr,delta-force,"Pros:Free copy of Battlefield.Excellent optimization.Minimal amount of bugs.Anti-cheat system. I don't know what it does to cheaters, apparently just scolds them, but it kicks honest players instead of banning them. In my opinion, this is a big plus.Cons:No team **** weapon **** class **** sound of enemy **** (Time to kill) - one millionth of a second. I have a very good stopwatch and I checked several times. Exactly one millionth of a second.Network code - better than in Battlefield, but not good enough for such a microscopic **** design - completely chaotic with an enormous number of passages. No matter which way you look, there are always a lot of enemies behind you.Cheaters - present. Developers actively fight cheaters by telling stories about how they actively fight cheaters.

I've played and explored every map and mode. In my experience, this game is fine but the matchmaking and the dev team are really shady. 
In warfare mode, I feel like only 10 out of 32 players in each team are actual people, the rest are bots but the dev said they're all players. 
The movement system is top-notch clunky, vehicles are way too OP. 
Net code is garbage, sometimes it takes a few bullets to kill, and sometimes it takes half a mag
Legendary skins use gacha mechanic so it can't get more Chinese than that. 
Also, they buffed all the Chinese guns in this game. The most OP AR right now is the CI-19 (QBZ - 191 in real life, which can't even spin the bullets right), so it's kinda propaganda-ish. 
About SBMM, ranked and unranked matches use the same pool of players, so even if you want to play a casual unranked match, you can't. You have to play with hardcore grinders all the time.  Also, this game has a mechanic that keeps your win rate close to 50%, which means for every battle won, you're gonna be sent to a lobby full of bots and ""casual players"" so that you inevitably lose. That frustrates me, that **** out all the joy of playing.
Next season, they're introducing a new operator who carries a shield and a grappling hook that pulls the enemies toward him so that he can beat the hell out of them with his shield. They are combining garbage features from BF2042 (Mackay and Dozer). What's next? A wingsuit?
It's true that no game can kill BF2042 because BF2042 killed itself, and with the current trajectory, I think Delta Force is tending to do the same.

metacritic,DragonulX,rust,"Rust Huh, the game that made my childhood better since I was watching the continuity creators on YouTube back when Zombies were on the map. I ended up playing with a friend for about 140 hours, most of which hours were done on empty servers or done by one of my friends using our monthly subscription initiated servers. Initially, I would have several reasons not to recommend the game, mainly because one of those main reasons is the overpriced price. But instead, I won't do this, because from my point of view, for how many hours I invested in the game and how I didn't feel them passing by me, being the game at the same time and very fun, I suppose they deserved their money. Starting with the worst phases of the game, as long as you don't play on a server made by you, you can't really put your soul into what you created or built on the game. In the game there is the wipe term, which at the choice of the owner who owns the server, can be: weekly, every two weeks, or every month) After this deadline, the whole map returns to its initial form from the beginning without any progress. The houses, your items in the inventory and everything you have mined or collected will disappear and you will basically get it from the beginning every time. It sounds very bad since most players of Survival games grew up with Minecraft, The Forest or Don't Starve, where in these games your progress was saved for the entire period of ownership. But it's not really like that, this only applies to servers officially listed on the server page of the game, if you want to create a server you can keep it for life without giving it a mandatory wipe but it will be unlisted and not you can set it as public, if you want it public you will have to comply with this requirement. It sounds decent so far, but there is another part to come. For you to be able to maintain a server is not as easy as in other games and especially since the game does not maintain the server created by you. Either you use Wireless Lan Party programs to invite others if you have a map and want it to run on your computer, or you have to buy a server domain which is not at all cheap unlike what I was used to do until now. These would be some disadvantages in what prevents its purchase if necessary. (You can have a public server with ""No Wipe"" only if there are no servers with Survival game mode. (example: PVP)In the rest, apart from these aspects, the game is ingenious, and comes to its base with a lot of new features and monthly or bi-monthly **** updates do not in any way damage the game or its image and even revive it every time something new appears because you always have something to do in it, especially if you are just starting out with the game and especially if you have a server with Wipe. The idea is that having a server with ""No Wipe"" you cannot expand your creativity as you want on it, most of the time you end up making a construction with the walls upgraded to the maximum and then you think that you have nothing left to do being that everything you did you did during the construction of the house. That's why Wipe exists, to evolve each player individually and all starting from the same point at the time of the Wipe. Imagine Hungar Games with Unlimited Respwn (that is if you don't play on Hardcore Mode) and with several players all evolving differently and attacking each other to capture territories and get materials from the battle or loots found on Map. The idea is very good and I wonder how since its launch it has not received an award or a congratulation for this complex idea, the basis of which is the community that continues to create and maintain active servers even today after a long time. I haven't really seen any bugs or glitches, the game is decent on the optimization side and the difficulty of the AI ​​in the game is to be congratulated. I recommend the game strictly if you have many friends with whom you can have a Party or Squad for Raids because otherwise it would sometimes seem boring to you and you would want to take a break with the game more and more often until you end up losing your interest completely, so that later to return to it again being a good game. On the music side, they tried to copy different ideas from other well-known Survivor games that have good music, and somehow they came out, but not how the developers expected it to come out. All in all, it's good, but it hasn't received updates with the music packet for a long time and I'd be impatient to see that. There are many things I could talk about when it comes to this game, but many of them end up having a positive impact on the game, which makes the final conclusion I recommend it with confidence, especially if you get it at a discount like - I also bought it by the way. I recommend to try for yourself to understand much more than from this review,",9,10

metacritic,xzipy,rust,"Rust may be one of the single most innovative games of its time AND in recent times. Those complaining about team sizes could just play solo-only servers, those complaining about time investment could play 2 day wipes, and those complaining about toxicity can just mute people! No matter your availability, game preference, or skill ability, there is a server for everyone and a great experience waiting in Rust.",10,10
metacritic,atenplex,rust,"Rust is a unique and unforgettable survival experience that rewards creativity, adaptability, and perseverance. Its blend of base building, resource management, and player interaction creates a compelling sandbox that can be as exhilarating as it is punishing. While it may not be for everyone, those who thrive in high-stakes environments will find Rust to be one of the most engaging survival games ever made.",7,10
metacritic,PotBellyDiver3,rust,This game is great it really is but what i do not like about it is the need for you to be active on it for at least 4 hours a day to have a fighting chance in it. The time requirement and the **** combat system land this game in a stark 6/10,6,10
metacritic,Bonzo101,rust,"Rust is a compelling and intense multiplayer survival game developed by Facepunch Studios, where players must gather resources, build shelters, and engage in PvP combat to survive on a deserted island. Starting with nothing, players quickly scavenge for materials to craft tools and weapons, navigating a challenging day-night cycle and constant threats from other players. The game's building and crafting systems are deep and rewarding, allowing for the creation of complex bases and equipment. Voice chat enhances social interactions, fostering alliances and rivalries within large servers. Despite its brutal and unforgiving nature, Rust offers an enriching experience as players outlast competitors and thrive in a hostile environment, making it a must-play for fans of survival games!",9,10

metacritic,EricReviews,rust,"Created by Facepunch, a group known for games such as g-mod, comes Rust. This PvP survival game pits you against both the struggles of surviving on a stranded island with no escape, but also the threat of other people and NPCs. Rust differs from other games in this genre because of its vast plethora of mechanics alongside a seemingly simple premise: survival.  Rust has a reputation for being a very challenging, unforgiving game, but I believe this simply adds to the excitement. Although it might seem that after a short while, there may be nothing new to do, but the constant fear of losing all your progress to either another player or natural causes is what makes this game stand out, as there is no safety for your hard-earned resources when offline.  This does, however, cause many players to develop severe addictions, with many members of the community gaining hour counts into the thousands.  Rust is well known for its steep learning curve, with players being judged harshly by others based on their playtime alone. The gunplay in this game also is quite difficult, making players memorize recoil patterns for many different guns, and get used to the fast time to kill. Even with the short TTK, fights involving larger groups can last hours at a time, with neither side wanting to leave the battle after putting so much time and resources in.   Many servers also introduce prizes and incentives such as bounties for the most competitive clans to compete for. This leads to the formation of very large groups, sometimes with 40+ players, working together to win money on a regular basis. The nature of the game, however, means that to keep a bounty for long enough to be cashed out, the clans have to stay active on a single server for days at a time, often leading to many sleepless nights lying in wait for an attack.  The gameplay loop can vastly vary in length with some so called ‘wipes’ lasting anywhere from a couple days to over a month. However, even though it may seem repetitive, with little variation on the gameplay, each wipe has many different encounters with new people each time, leading to an enjoyable experience for as long as you make it enjoyable.  Rust is available on both console and PC, costing upwards of £20, and can be played on either keyboard and mouse or most standard modern controllers. However, the advantages offered by keyboard and mouse leads to problems in the console community with external devices such as zens.  Graphics/Attention to Detail and Environmental interaction/Scenery/Art Direction and Style Rust has a reasonably minimalistic art style, but this doesn’t detract from the game's positives.  The sound design for the game is both immersive and reliable, with most sounds being easily distinguished between. Rust can be very difficult to run on lower end devices, and can often crash alongside excruciating loading times, but there are very few noticeable bugs, and with the game being updated regularly none stay around for too long. One of the worst and best aspects of this game are the interactions with other players. While some can be kind or funny, most are extremely hostile, and the majority of encounters involve a stream of slurs through the microphone. For this reason, I would definitely not recommend this game to younger individuals as a lot of the language and threats used are quite nerve racking for less confident people.  Overall, the game itself has many strong features, but the community does slightly let it down at times.",4,10

No story or environmental design is present, the developers clearly had no plan at the beginning, playing RUST feels like a middleschooler's idea of a video game, where mechanics from various genres are cobbled together without any underlying rationale or thought. How, anyone could continue to produce such a game without any premeditation is simply stunning. If you meet somebody, and you learn they play RUST, avoid them as they are a true psychopath.",1,10

There's so incredibly much to do in this game. As you start out you'll be overwhelmed and you'll want to quit, but that is eventually what seperates the full-kits from the nakeds.

Además de ser un juego muy ligero en espacio, abarcando apenas unos 20gb en la memoria ssd.

metacritic,Prevyus,rust,"Its crazy how a game can sometimes be so fun and so frustrating at the same time. I have more than 3000 hours on the game, I am still not very good at pvp but for some reason, I really like trying my best to get the most I can, as a solo or with a team, I always have fun. I have been playing it the past 3 years and ive seen a lot of people complain about the updates we get but personally, every update we have had has been fun and gives us a better time, even if they havent fixed some of the problems there are. The bad side of the game is more because of the players. There are really nice people in the game, but its true most are toxic, although this is an aspect of the game and how brutal it can be, and in my opinion it makes it fun. It all goes down hill when the players start cheating and ruining everyone elses experience. When I get killed and lose all my stuff, its frustrating but i know its part of the game, but when a cheaters takes everything from you, there is nothing you can do and thats what has ruined the game for me a couple times.

Rust isn't optimized that well either it can take a long time to load into a sever, even taking hours sometimes. And it can lag a lot even on low settings. Though I'd say that depends on your Pc.

metacritic,Kampfarsch,rust,"Stagnant meta, poor performance and nonsensical poorly implement or thought out updates.
One of those survival games that never actually left early access.

No efforts have been made to bring fresh air to its battleroyale-esque death match quick snowballing meta.
There hasn't been any major PvE content or new gun in years and what's already there is hardly working or balanced.
The survival mechanics are entirely neglected and easily ignored.
Every update makes the game worse in various aspects or flops so hard that people forget it even exists after a week.

The developers are a self-published small indie studio and they HAVE a public testing environment to throw new ideas at but they don't utilize it at all.
In fact they have only just recently (April 7th 2022) started collecting player analytics with that all but confirming that they had only surface level knowledge of how people play the game really puts the past 9 years of updates and missing balance patches into perspective.

Changes are small and always out of left field it's often questionable if they are working on the game at all or spending all their time on a new project.
It takes actual years of constant **** for the developers to fix glaring issues with them seemingly not understanding the problem  in the first place.
This looks like a lack of passion and direction.

Rust has only made it this far because of its unique blend of core mechanics and the fact that a highly punishing game like this attracts a player base that isn't easily scared off by 1 bad change a month.
Of course those unnoticed monthly bad changes stack up and I'm confident in saying that the game is in a much worse state now than it was 2 years ago.",4,10

metacritic,UncleEd,rust,"Rust is the game you would wish existed back in the heyday of MMORPGS. Unforgiving PVP with consequences, where you can end up literally dominating the entire server. So, if you are the sort of person who enjoys tension in online PVP games, this should sound very good to your ears. And Rust honestly delivered in building that tense, insecure atmosphere in my first couple of hours. You start naked, with a piece of rock. You mine ores, destroy trees, build your first weapon and just try to survive. Any animal, any player is your potential murderer and players won’t hesitate to murder you and loot all your things.

The more I played though, the more I observed how this is not a game “for me”. Even when you are offline, your base can be raided and everything you have can be stolen. The community is beyond toxic, but that’s kind of expected for this sort of game. Servers usually reset weekly, biweekly or monthly, preventing many players from everlasting slavery and giving everyone a chance to start on equal terms. But that comes with a caveat: All the benefits you earned by your grinding will be lost no matter what.

Also, it should be mentioned that Rust offers some “lite” pay-to-win items. You can purchase things which appear to be only cosmetic, but do actually provide some gameplay advantages.

Rust is a good game for people with a very specific taste in games. It achieves what it’s going for, but ultimately is not a game most people would be willing to invest their time in, including myself. If you are a solo player, stay away from Rust. If you have limited time to invest in one game, stay away from Rust. If a mature community is important for you, stay away from Rust. But if this type of extremely unforgiving game is what you and your group of friends are looking for, you may actually love it.

1. Grind is so painful and slow thaht you have to become addicted to grind one vehicle and then again again its frustrating 
2. Russian vehicles are OP yes they are beleive me when i say this take for example T-34 and shot driver hatch you will get nice richochet instead of penetration 
3. Players are garbage as far as their reddit community instead of helping new players they always say skill issue or get good
4. Premium vehicles ah yes this this is peak Gayjin moment they constantly pump new vehicles for REAL money so people can spend it 
5. Also dont bother watch youtubers they have paid actors
6. No new tech trees or anything 
7. If you want to test your new vehicle in custom battles you wont get RP or SL
8. Game is not accurate nor realistic 
9.WW2  vehicles fighting Modern vehicles from 50s and 60s
10. Pure Greed of developers read the 4th number

metacritic,Dread396,war-thunder,"For a game that has notoriety on ""accuracy"" of vehicles and aircraft, it is *incredibly* arcade fake even on realism. Using a HOTAS will absolutely put you at huge disadvantage as 99.9% of players are using mouse and keyboard or controller for super easy aim and control. The other major issue with this game is the pay to win structure. Anyone who says it's not is 100% delusional. This game is built around catering to whales and nothing more, nothing less. The other team can literally just buy the win by buying as many reinforcements as they want and the best planes and upgrades. You can see other players the second the spawn from 50 miles away. They are always on HUD and radar and it even tells you what plane they are in. There is no surprising players. There's no ""I'll just hide behind this mountain and come around behind them"". That doesn't exist here. There's no going very high altitude and diving down without the entire enemy team seeing you the entire time, making bombers useless against anyone with more than 2 brain cells to rub together.  You have to buy or grind not only vehicles/planes, but you have to buy/grind the crew for EACH.  Your bomber has 16 machine guns covering every angle? That's cool, they can't hit anything unless you have over 100 hours on that specific plane for them to even have a 10% chance to hit something (aka probably never).  You will be constantly rammed instead of shot because people can't aim. Surprisingly, the game often rewards people that do this and it causes your plane to completely explode while they aren't even scratched. Aimbots are rampant. Not much more to say on that, it's free to play so people can make accounts really fast to keep trying until things work very easily. There's a grand total of like 3 game modes with no filtering for maps. All modes, even realistic just feels super arcadey and fake. Lastly, the UI is a MESS. The entire process of researching, maintaining, upgrading, and even just choosing different planes/vehicles is a headache. It's made to be confusing intentionally to increase chances of accidental purchases or wasting more time playing the game than you need to. Everything is just counter intuitive by design. There is also a heavy russian bias for balancing that is inexcusable. Bottom Line: Stay far away from this if you're looking for anything even remotely resembling a flight sim, or even an arcade/action flight game. You're FAR FAR FAR better off just buying a Battlefield game and flying in that because even that is more realistic and most importantly *fun*, than this heap of garbage. Even Ace Combat would be better. The only redeeming quality this game has is that the graphics are decent. Not amazing, but decent. That's it.",1,10

Realistic textures, upgraded with free graphic's DLC's looking even better, and realistic damage model will totaly attract you into playing the game. You play for a few hours, and got to rank II. You say to yourself ""This game is pretty fun, I will have my favorite vehicles in no time!"" You get to rank III and realize something. ""Why is it taking so long?"" You see other players with 600 hours played have jets in rank VII, while you still rot in low tier battles, with the same ammount of hours as them. You plas and play and play, you're 900 hours in, with only rank IV. Your dreams of having your dream vehicles are blown away, realizing that you will reach top tier in another 1000/2000 hours. ""How can they already have top tier in 3 different countries?"" Well, the question is quite simple. Players can buy a thing called ""golden eagles"", a special currency in the game, obtainble only by completing some of the basic training (around 400/500 of GE in total) or by buying them with money. Players with this currency can research vehicles faster, even skip the whole research, buy ""silver lions"" (currency awarded in battles) and buy an vehicle basicly instantly. They can even buy special ""premium vehicles"" in the game, obtainble only by GE (or real money. Vehicles for real money can be purchased on the Gaijin Entertainment War Thunder website, and can cost up to 80 dollars and more). Players can also buy ""premium account"" (premium account gives you more research points and SL from battles) for GE. Players then have even easier and quicker playthrough, then free to play players. F2P (free to play) players will be grinding all the way up the tech tree, waisting a big number of hours on the game, and won't get far, while P2W (pay to win) players can just buy the whole tech tree. Did I also mentioned that the game is, ""free to play""? It acts like it's a free to play game, but it isn't. You pay with your time, and some people even with money.

metacritic,queltizioli4652,war-thunder,"The game is one of the best in its category: it has good models, graphics, realism and a lot of vehicles, but it's definitely not worth your time. To progress, you have to grind all your way to the jets in the ads starting from 1930s planes, and the grind is slow, long and painful. 
The early stages of the game are easy and fun, but as you progress the game gets unplayable because of uptiers (the game is (un)balanced with a Battle Rate system ruled by an algorythm, so that you can find yourself in a Spitfire against a Sabre), CAS (every tank battle will be ruined by planes bombing the **** out of you), russian bias (russian tanks are sometimes better than they should), total absence of advanced tutorials (they want you to pay to win because you don't know how to play) and, as I said, a grind that takes forever, wasting either your money (by buying premium account or vehicles) or time. Add a greedy, deaf-to-community-instances and obnoxious developer and tons of bugs and this is what you get. There is also a lack of gamemodes, that restrict the playstyle of every vehicle to one they are not suited for.
Here is a summary of the game: Air Arcade: join the fray, kill and get killed; Air Realistic: you climb for 5 minutes and then get killed by someone else OR you bomb targets and then you die; tank arcade: kill (maybe) and get killed; tank realistic: get sniped by a tank 2.5 km away through a pixel-wide spot.

For example, If you love to fly the mig 21 you have to compete with modern F16 which are in every conceivable way better than a Mig21. In the Mig 21 you have worse missiles, a worse radar, a worse airframe with a worse engine and your handycap is in no way compensated. A good comparison here would be a racing game in which you have to compete with a Class C car against Class S cars, because that's exactly what Warthunder does, allowing vehicles from different times with different abilities to compete against each other without compensating for any handicap an that in a PVP online experience.

Разработчики просто не могли пропустить ни одну возможность содрать с вас деньги. Открывание новых танков или самолетов требует либо бесконечных часов гринда, либо крупных вложений реальных денег. Это нечестно и очень раздражает. Вместо того, чтобы наслаждаться игровым процессом, вы постоянно замечаете, что вас обдирают и пытаются выжать каждый цент.

К тому же, гринд в этой игре просто невыносимо долгий. Чтобы достичь чего-то значимого, вы должны проводить бесчисленные часы, повторяя одни и те же задания снова и снова. Это утомляет и убивает всю охоту за увлекательным геймплеем.

Графика в Вартандер тоже оставляет желать лучшего. Все выглядит устаревшим и недоработанным. Некоторые модели танков и самолетов выглядят так, будто они были нарисованы еще в начале 2000-х годов. Игра просто не соответствует современным стандартам и оставляет ощущение, будто вы играете во что-то, что давно уже устарело.

В общем, я не рекомендую Вартандер никому. Если вы хотите потратить свое время и деньги на игру, которая постоянно требует вложений и не приносит никакого удовольствия, то пожалуйста, присоединяйтесь.

metacritic,rubberduck923,war-thunder,"War Thunder, a game that once held great promise and brought endless enjoyment, has sadly lost its way, leaving players feeling abandoned by the developer. What was once an engaging experience has been tainted by exploitative economic practices and a disturbing pattern of neglecting player concerns.

One of the most disappointing aspects of War Thunder is its predatory economy, specifically designed to drain players' hard-earned resources. The developer shamelessly employs tactics that force players into frustrating cycles of grinding or expensive microtransactions. The in-game economy feels unbalanced, making progress painfully slow for those who choose not to spend real money. It's disheartening to witness a game that was once fair and enjoyable devolve into a blatant money-grab.

Even more disconcerting is the developer's constant gaslighting of the playerbase. Despite overwhelming negative feedback and valid concerns raised by the community, the developer consistently downplays and dismisses legitimate criticisms, attempting to spin every negative change as a positive improvement. It's both bewildering and infuriating to see them refuse to acknowledge the erosion of trust and goodwill they once had from their players.

This persistent gaslighting not only undermines players' faith in the game's future but also creates a toxic environment within the community. Rather than fostering open dialogue and genuine engagement, the developer seems content with pushing their own agenda at the expense of player satisfaction. This blatant disregard for player feedback and concerns is a direct insult to the loyal fanbase that helped War Thunder thrive in the first place.

It's truly disheartening to witness the downfall **** that was once beloved by so many. The developer's profit-driven economic model, coupled with their gaslighting tactics, has soured the overall experience for players who were once deeply passionate about War Thunder. It's high time for the developer to reflect on their choices and reevaluate their priorities, as their current path only serves to alienate and frustrate the playerbase they should be nurturing.

In conclusion, the decline of War Thunder speaks volumes about the developer's misguided decisions and their willingness to prioritize profit above player satisfaction. The exploitative economy and persistent gaslighting tactics employed by the developer have transformed what was once a promising game into a mere shadow of its former self. It's a regrettable state of affairs that leaves dedicated players disenchanted and searching for a gaming experience that genuinely values their input and enjoyment.",0,10
metacritic,DannyDeyeeeto,war-thunder,"The developer's greed has turned this game to . Huge repair costs, reduction of rewards per match, premium vehicles dominating all games, grindiest events you have ever seen, et cetera. Not to mention that the devs don't seem to play their own game and they balance vehicles based on player stats and REPAIR COST, (an amount of ingame currency a vehicle costs when you die with it), this stupid feature is only there so you get less currency and potentioally pay real money because you can't afford the new tank you just researched. About that. Tanks take exponentially more research points to get. While a rank 1 vehicle will take you 3000 points(1-3 matches), a top tier vehicle takes 400.000! (~100 matches). So if you want to play like they show you in the trailers, have fun playing this game daily for a year with still no T-80 in sight. The Devs have decreased and removed all kinds of rewards over the years and made the grind unbearable for f2p players and even for premium users. Ah yeah and you have to research planes seperately. I have around 2000 hours in this game, I just swiched from the piece of  warthunder launcher that uses all bandwith when it auto-updates the game every time you start up your pc.

This is unacceptable, the game will DIE if this continues, denying that anything is wrong, gas lighting your player base saying the complainers are the minority, and removing the game from Steam is NOT how a respectable company should behave.

[edit]

Most of the economy changes have been addressed, not just having been reverted, but for the most part vastly improved - the game is much more playable now, one can actually make quite the profit in matches without having a premium account.

Review can be no higher than a 6/10 as there are still underlying issues that need addressing, including but not limited to: CAS (Close Air Support) still being grossly overpowered, laziness when it comes to the addition of new vehicles (they can be extremely buggy, see the state of the ""LOSAT"" for an example), battle rating ""compression"" which leads to things from World War II vehicles facing things vastly superior platforms from the 1950s, 60s and even 70s.",6,10

metacritic,Shraknel,war-thunder,"I have been playing since the early days of this game before jets and tanks were even a thought in this game.

I have played on the stand alone client and then moved to the steam client version when it came to steam. The 1300 hours that steam shows that I have doesn't even begin sum up the amount of time I have put into this game.

With that said I highly suggest avoiding this game.

Since I started playing top tier I've bought premium time every time it's on sale. Even then it doesn't solve the economy issues, it just makes them a little more bearable.

The thing is, the net rewards I get now WITH PREMIUM TIME are less than the net rewards I got a few years ago without it. How does that work? Gaijin creates a problem, and sell the solution, except the solution doesn't work.

Playing Sweden is downright impossible, and having fun at anything over 7.0 in any nation is a laughable suggestion.

It's almost as if Gaijin has learnt that a lot of the playerbase 'subscribe' to war thunder, mainly due to gaijin's continuous negative economy changes, that war thunder is pretty much now accepted as a subscription game, especially over 7.0. given the large proportion of subscribers, the general earning of vehicles get skewed up, thus gaijin has to change them in order to push more premium vehicles, and premium time onto players. The problem is, most of those players are already paying for premium time. Premium time is no longer an option that lets you progress faster, it's a subscription to the game, and you suffer the same as F2P players at lower tiers do. This is Unacceptable.

Gaijin has even admitted that tech tree vehicles are balanced to not be profitable. In a game that relies on players making in-game money to progress, giving them vehicles that are designed to cause them to lose SL does not make them want to spend more on the game, it turns them away.

More and more premium vehicles get added every update, but the F2P and premium subscription players get shafted with rewards decreases and repair cost increases.

As much as I appreciate Gaijin needs to make money, their operating costs haven't significantly increased, yet the playerbase and number of paying customers has. Many players, myself included, would be far more inclined to spend money on the game if the changes benefitted the paying players. Selling a premium jet for the price of an AAA game is ridiculous, given this is generally not a one-off purchase for the individual, they may buy others. AAA games that sell for half as much still get continuous updates, despite the sales pretty much being the purchase of the game. I'm sure MANY players would pay for war thunder, even subscribe (as a lot do already) if the game actually rewarded them for spending their hard earned money on it.

Again do not play or spend any money on this game till Gaijin turns the greedy ass around and makes the game something that is enjoyable to play.",0,10

However I have had the benefit of playing this game since 2013. Since that time the ability to progress and purchase new vehicles has rapidly diminished due to various changes to the ingame economy and research gains, making the game extremely hard for newer players to get into unless they purchase premium accounts or vehicles, something that should never be mandatory for a game but too often is when playing War Thunder.

I believe War Thunder can have a very bright future if Gaijin reverses the changes it has made to the games economy in recent years, but I fear that if they do not that the game has a high chance of a very bleak future indeed, one I hope does not come to pass.

From a gameplay perspective this should be an easy 9/10, but taking into account the above issues I have to leave my score very low for the time being, though of course this can be changed if steps are taken to rectify those issues.",2,10

Moving from AI bots to human players made the flaws in the game very, very apparent.

The problem is that every game against human players follows the exact same path. Most players pay up for premium tanks with premium ammo and all the perks they can mount, and then they pick specific spots on each map to hide and wait. The rest of the players then have to move very carefully from one hiding spot to the next, following a very specific path on each map, to avoid getting picked off by one of the hidden premium players.

Fast forward to the game today, it is literallythe battles of the premiums, you simply just cant compete and have fun without buying premium tanks yourself.

Yo, write something about this tank we WILL add, we will never read it tho. So NAH. Normal players, literally f*ck you. Most of their focus gets the premium shop and battlepasses and now popular boxes-nice to promote gamble... Just things that create money, **** community. I loved the game since I was 10. But now, I rarely open it, its just not worth the stress and mostly, frustration from the fact that the game doesnt work the way its told it should. Like, camo-bushes some maps have bushes that does not give you camo bonus, no official info about it tho, ammunitio-HE rounds being able to go through wall (destroyable, yet it goes THROUGH - High Explosive)? HAH. Armor effectivenes-textures of weakspots, some dont match their truly used models in actual game, maps being unbalanced and unplayable, more op tanks coming soon and no powering of old tanks that are literally useless nowadays, like BatChat or Maus. Nothing is going right in the game. More op tanks and less care about strategy and skill.
Few good things I would like to mention (So I dont get banned from our great (wot) admins, that care more about N words then about cheats and their big failures). Here are the good things (Not much, because theres not much to say):
Themes - Halloween, Christmas, D-Day, Anniversarys and so on. But always put the loot boxes with them ;)
Visuals of the game - New engine few years ago and overall better graphics make the game even more authentic. (Before an EBR drives by in f*cking 80-90Km/H giving you 600 while at top speed xd)

Overall game is very hard at beggining, to learning if not doing properly and other things, which i explain later.


Gameplay:

- 80% of time is playing random battles (and sitting in garage), 15v15 on random maps with random squads, tanks etc.- its easy to learn at beggining how to drive, shoot etc, but its hard to master.

- game require tons of knowledge, learning properly, and having very, VERY strong patience and nerves also for a reason.

- its not realisting game, but arcade one, with rng spreaded everywhere.

- tons of tanks to obtain and play with lots of different playstyles, and so...

- ...endless grind, or not that endless, very long and sometimes painful, the most important thing and underrated   in WoT is economy itself.

- events from time to time (most are repeated for years), some of them as quite fun, unique battle modes and often,   mostly treated as another source to grind.

- 'teamplay' (in random battles ofc, and some other modes) well in most part it isn't a teamplay but maximizing the score using random players and   situation on battlefield, trusting only in yourself and platoon mates if you have one. Yes its quite egoistic at some point, but you'll understand sooner or later why.

- Clans, clan modes, if you want a real teamplay, or even get new friends, platoonmates etc. .

Community, playerbase etc:
 In most part is ****, toxic, bad and dont even know how to treat this game properly, (just look at most bad reviews you see at this site, and not only. At least there are still good players in this game), malding being at the same time extremly bad - in most cases they'll make you fall into being **** as well, making it even harder to start and especially get better in this game, which is crucial not to flex with stats, but to economy itself. But not only that, to summarise: welcome to the game where 90% of entire player base is truly bad and dont even want to be better at the game, saying they're casuals not even being a good one - a one total chaos you must overcome if you ever want to play this game (At least dont critizise a player not only from stats, some of them could be fine).


Main problems of this game: 

- its very addictive, many players are saying that game is bad, which is kinda 'bad' at long term, but they'll still play it or come back cuz its their habit or even buying a lot of crap in this game for real money. Good luck when trying to quit this game.

- Game is rng itself - game have too much RNG mechanics, making 'getting better' less rewarding than in other games, but still rewarding. For a reason Wot isn't an Esport game despite its popularity. At the same time, RNG is the reason why game is alive to this day - tough ****.  

- Rng can be often unfair and main reason of 'strange theories' created in mind of bad players. The better you are, you'll realise how rng wants to treat you badly,and give a chance for bad players, or it is just an another illusion to overcome? Is game balanced in this way? Well its hard to tell... its a rng overall and nobody knows how it'll behave. 

- WoT right now require even smaller amount of microstransatcions to make grind at least less painful. Buying at least one good t8 premium tank cause its very painful to grind at beggining, or to torture getting one free T8 premium from bond shop. Remember: in ""free"" game, you're a product. 

- Game isn't P2W, game is more P2Progress, with this amount of grind and slow it is, at least game can be F2P, if doing grind properly and learning.

Game is unbalanced in many ways, and bad how fast battles are now.

- WoT is getting worse just like i mentioned at beggining - bad decisions, less resources when grinding, and not even fixing issues like WG should, they're spending most resources in some **** to sell, and rest is barely working, often with bigger issues, BUT its working.

- its hard to get a good informations in WoT, you need a really good source or even some mentor to make game quite comfortable to play - which is quite hard.

- Game is very frustrating and will change your behavior into being toxic the further you go. WoT can very negatively impact on psyche if not defending from such behaviour,   up to pathology levels in some extreme scenarios affecting your life.

Do I want to recomend this game? Well, I'd say - not at all or even no - this game doesn't deserve to be popular. 
At least is good at some perspective, if you want - try it, but remeber my warnings. If you remembered, then you have a chance to change this game into a good casual habit.

metacritic,cameltanker,world-of-tanks,"Diabolical game. Unless you have money to sink into this game, don't bother. There are sad individuals who play this game consistently and grind through special missions to get a premium tank which they then have to buy eith gold - which costs money. Then, due to the appalling match making, (mm) you as a non paying player will be drawn against them in your stock tank which you have taken ages to grind through the tech tree to get. Then you're game will maybe last 2 minutes. Cheating is rife with players using illegal mods and WG rest on their laurels and create no new maps for months and months. WG's idea of an update is to nerf a premium tank you may have paid for and make it worse. RNG (random number generator) means your heavy tank fires an armour piercing round at a light tank and it bounces off. Tanks randomly disappear and stay hidden when they fire. There used to be a chat page which would attract anti Semites, racists and all sorts of undesirables but instead of moderating the language and players, they simply got rid of the chat.

metacritic,stabtraitor,world-of-tanks,This game was once a great game... Now it's a cash machine where any new player that is grinding the levels has to play the perdrix to satisfy higher/old level players. In other words: you are rarely playing facing only your level ... You have to know the maps by heart now to know where to shoot and where you tank fits. There's no more random victory possible.. It's just a matter of being at the good spot and knowing the **** map by heart.. The maps have been worked out so hard to wipe any unfair grounds that there's mainly no place for creativity anymore... there's only one window where you can fire and where you can protect. If there's already a player there you are screwed.. I just hate what they made of it.,1,10
metacritic,Ery255,world-of-tanks,"I recently installed this game just for some fun between meetings and calls. I have a few tier 8-10 tank which I grinded out when the game came out +10 years ago.

There are two important things to know about this game: 

Firstly: If you want to play top tier tanks it is mostly pay-to-win, or an extreme grind.

Secondly: This game is filled with really toxic people, that insult you and your team regulary via chat. There is spam en masse, too.

I am totally fine with the pay-to-win/play part.

What is unbearable for **** people ist that there is no filter for abuse/insults/antisemitism/e.g. in place.
You cannot mute the chats, which contents are punishable by law in most western european countries.

Tanks that can not be damaged by enemies that they can encounter for example VK 168.01 (P) or VK 100.01 P with minimal armor of 120 and 100mm can fight tanks like KV-1S with 86 mm of penetration. 
Looking at Premium tanks making even worse, Bourrasque is not only better than most mediums, it is better than light tanks at light tank role. And if you want to loose hope completelyyou can look at BZ-176.
Premium ammo everyone can buy, but not afford, without premium and boosters it is impossible to use them, while with premium benefits players just load only premium ammo and get a significant penetration advantage.
It is not a chaotic or precise game, where advantage can be overwhelmed by skill or situation, teams matched up to be as equal as possible and paid benefits easily flipping the result of a battle.",0,10

Yes moments like this will happen in any tank game, but here it is 95 % of the engagements you can't go around, the maps are too small for that. Also who the hell created this vision mechanic?

Por mi parte he probado estrategias belicistas (tampoco demasiado, que soy buena gente), culturales, diplomáticas y religiosas, pero, aunque de primeras si que he llegado a ser una potencia, siempre me he visto superado según avanzaba la partida

metacritic,aitorsibo,sid-meiers-civilization-vi,"The legendary simulation/strategy game. Civ 6 is surprisingly deep if you want it to be. Easy to play, very hard to master. Made of many small building blocks that align together in many different ways. Settling is a mini game of its own, managing your territory and beyond to place the cities in the best possible positions. If you master this game, you’re even seeing where your districts will be placed, and how you’ll benefit from adjacency to others. Where you’ll put your wonders, which city will handle what, etc. Technologies and civics are key and varied. It is brutally important to keep short/mid and long term goals in mind when deciding what to research. One moment too late and you’ll be left with a low tier unit against a fierce opponent. One moment too late and someone else will build the wonder you were dreaming of. I absolutely love how the map is built, procedurally from a varied set of presets. The map is built out of hexagons, and every unit pathfinds through them. Each tile may have special features, it can be made of water, dry land, forest… It can contain a specific resource or be ideal for a certain **** you advance in the game, you’ll discover more of the map, and unlock more of its resources to exploit. You’ll witness how your civilization grows from the stone age to the future age, and be instrumental in how it all plays out. Playing online is advised as the AI is limited, so if you have some friends that are up to it play with them. It’s much better online. The game suffers from the classical simulation game issue in late game, where your civ has grown too much and you have too much to micro-manage, so take that into account. I think it lacks more complex endings to decide who wins a game, the default ones are just too straightforward. If you amass science and production you’ll win first, that’s how it is. If you don’t like the other paths, you’ll end up playing similarly unless your opponents force you to adapt.Overall, this is most probably the greatest simulation/strategy game in the market as of now.",9,10

metacritic,LT_Gruber,sid-meiers-civilization-vi,"Amazing game, absolute masterpiece.

Civilization is one of my all-time favorite games, and the leap from the fifth to the sixth game is epic. It offers new mechanics, tons of stuff to do and build and a fresh new look over the older games. There is some new and relaxing music, more factions and overall, it is a huge improvement over the previous game.

Civilization has always been a turned based game in which you can build, move, attack or improve buildings in your turn. Every faction does their move simultaneously and after that, a new round starts. You win the game by conquering all the capitals, achieve cultural victory, science victory or a religious victory. This means that you are not bound to one specific goal. If your military **** for example, you can try to build as many museums, theaters and zoo’s as possible, to get victorious on tourism and culture. You can trade with other factions/people, build alliances, open your borders, make some shady deals, it is just great.

You can play as many different world leaders from the days of old to the modern era. Alexander the Great, Saladin, Queen Victoria, and many more, they are all there. They all have their special bonusses and you should take advantage of them by building your empire accordingly. For example, Saladin is more focused on religion and trade and only in the starting eras, his military is strong. When the modern age arrives, you really struggle to achieve military successes. Every character has a little backstory that is historically accurate and fun to read.

The game is meant to be played online against friends or other people but offers some scenarios and a skirmish mode for you to play solo. You can always play against the AI factions, which are really well done. The balance of the AI is great and if you want a challenge, you will surely get it.

This installment in the series offer new mechanics like natural disasters, new ways of collecting resources from the map and a new system in which your era score determines if you are entering a golden age or a dark age. With a golden age, you prosper and thrive, with a dark age, you struggle to come around. You earn era score by discovering great inventions, doing research and achieve eureka moments. These new mechanics do require some DLC tough. I really liked the natural disaster mechanic, but sometimes, it got a little over the top. When you see your towns melt away by an active volcano, your harbor washed away by the twelfth million flood and see Darude with his sandstorm, raving over your farmlands, you know, they got no mercy on you.

The graphics and animations are beautiful. The map is blooming with life and movement, and I really like that everything is just so colorful and detailed. Many times, I zoom in close on my empire to see all the different quarries, lumber mills and dams spin and turn.

The sound effects and music are perfect. They are well designed for this game, and I think this is one of the better sound and music designs I have seen. The ambient music is really relaxing and when your units engage in combat, the shots and hits sound just great.

Like usual, Civilization is a hard game. It takes strategy, practice and management to master this game and even then, factors like starting point, barbarians and aggression from other players or states weigh even heavier. However, the game does offer excellent tutorials and gives you a fair chance to learn it.

Civilization VI is a game that I play to relax, with or without friends. Just taking my time, slowly building and developing my empire. I feel no stress, no time pressure, just pure joy and chill. It is one of the few games that I can always pick up and play, without it ever boring me. Maybe Civilization VII will be even better, I don’t know, but for now, this is just a masterpiece **** that will always be one of my favorites.

Definitely recommend this gem.",10,10

metacritic,Robobob,sid-meiers-civilization-vi,"Long time Civ fan since the days of Civ 1.  Each version I've played 100s of hours.  This and Civ 3 are the only versions I'd give a thumbs down.
The good: The graphics are great.  There are some new decent tweaks to aspects of the game like culture, civics and golden ages.
The bad: movement.  The change to movement where trying to move into difficult terrain ends your movement, though it makes sense, sloooows the game down to a snails pace.  Even a scout exploring the map is reduced to a tile a turn in diffcult terrain.  And roads are practically useless until modern times and/or the railroad.  You know roads are useless when your units ignore them when auto-moving across your empire.  So moving across your empire in classic times, with roads, can take you 100s of years, I kid you not.
1 unit per tile.  They did away with unit stacks in Civ 5 to avoid the doom stacks, and I didn't complain as much there.  But here, topped with the slow movement rates, makes the movement worse.  Units can't stack with friendly units so city state units are constantly in the way while aimlessly wandering the map, taking it even longer to move across your empire.  You can't auto assign a military unit to protect a trade unit.  You can't stack non-military units for some reason.  I love how you need to remove a unit from a city just to buy or start construction of a new unit.
AIs use of religion is just annoying and makes me want to quit everytime they ramp up sending countless missionary units to my empire.  You can' t just close your borders to them like you do military units.
The UI is disorganized and messy.  It's harder to find simple city lists and yields from earlier games like Civ 5.  Districts are a coll add but I had to download a mod to delete them if I change my mind and want to build somewhere else.  User mods change a lot of simple issues that Firaxis has opted to ignore in favor of more expensive expansions.
WE got a new civ every 5 years since Civ1 except we were due for a new one in 2021 but Firaxis added a yearly game-pass like expansion for Civ 6 instead of a new game.  God help us if this is the last new Civ game because the core mechanics need a lot of work.",4,10

metacritic,marc5477,sid-meiers-civilization-vi,"Shadow of former glory. This beloved franchise continues to take steps backward from its origins. What used to be a tactical strategy franchise for teens and adults has been dumbed down s that even a grade schooler can figure it out. This is clearly a desperate move by executives to score a few extra bonuses while they trash the franchise without a care in the world. Though I am all for making games for everyone, this is not a Civilization game any more and they should have called it something else but they knew that if they had, it would have likely flopped.

So whats the problem with civ6? Same thing as civ5 and same problem as the old horrible game on the xbox360 calling itself civilizations. They once again chose to go with the single unit per tile approach and very few tactical options as you advance through eras. Combat is straight boring because its too easy and the AI is predictable to the point that the only way they could manage to make the game harder was to give the AI insane types of cheats. This is how you know a game is poorly designed. How bad are the cheats? Well aside from the just pure multipliers to unit strength and economic stuff, they also give the AI double to triple your starting resources. How bad does it cheat? Well even on normal difficulty (Prince) they get a boost to science, culture and faith as well as a big boost to production and economy and a free tech. THATS ON NORMAL and yet, despite the advantage... they are a total joke because they cannot make good choices and that doesnt change with higher difficulty. So how do you overcome horrible design? Give more bonuses which is literally the least fun way to design a tactical game. How bad does it get? You start with 1 settler and 1 warrior but the AI will start with up to 3 settlers, 5 warriors, and 2 builders! LoL. Thats how bad the design is and you know what makes this even sadder? Even on that difficulty it only took 2 tries for me to figure out how to beat them silly. Thats how bad the AI is.

Further the 1 unit per tile approach shrinks the map immensely taking away from any sort of feeling of scale. This feels more like a horrible tactical RPG made for 8 year olds more than it does civilizations. Remember Final Fantasy Tactics? That was great right? Well this i FFT with less than half the units and 95% of the spells and abilities removed. Does that sound fun to you? Maybe when I was 2nd grade.

I can go into all the other stuff that has been cut from the old games to make this more accessible to the masses but it would just depress me. Civilization the franchise seems to be dead if you are an adult looking for good tactical gameplay. It might be ok if you are super casual or very young. Otherwise skip this and dont bother with civ5 either. The last decent civ game was 4.",1,10

Degenerate ****. Ai is dumb as hell. Therefore game is easily boring. Only fun aspect is the sim city. Thats it. Thats **** for a game. Ai spawns are atrocious, always spawn directly next to player. If an ai spawns by itself on its own continent, the game is lost. Difficulty is the most degenerate **** design of this game. Ai gets cheat bonuses without getting smarter or difficult. Most higher difficulty games are ONLY challenging due to every AI attacking you upon contact. The moral of this game is haha you waste your time loser. A loss feels like a middle finger. A win feels jack shi due to the journey being insanely easy or absurdely stupid. The music is annoying as hell. constant loop for 4-5+ hours sessions which makes u mute it. Garbage game design. This game was released in 2016 and still buggy as hell. such as infinite loading when pressing end turn. constant crashes with updated graphics cards. Civ 6 does its best at telling you to shut the fk up and kill yourself. The leaders themselves are so poorly designed, unbalanced, garbage. Every game ends up either being science or domination victory due to poor ai combat skills and science being way too easy with no way to stop the final stage of science victory. The press conference is by far the most diabolical garbage in this game, dogsht. haven't met half the leaders in the game and expects you to vote for an ideological option.. except its designed to ruin your day as the ai will ALWAYS vote against you such as voting against bonuses against you or diplomatic wins. Its not 1 or 2 leaders. its EVERY leader who votes against you which makes this conference POINTLESS AF. I play on emperor difficulty as deity is full of **** but king is WAY TOO EASY. Half the game is getting rolled by AI and having to spend atleast 4 to 5 hours resetting. If an Ai gets science route and is on the final stage of the victory, YOU LOSE.

There's just so much lacking from the core of this game that it's slightly mind boggling how they allocate their development efforts to putting more civs and more features in the game. That's all cool and all, don't get me wrong, I like all the stuff that came out clear into early 2021. but the reality of it is the game is STILL a buggy mess. I've played it with several $2000+ dollar gaming pc's that I've built and my primary playing friend also has a top of the line PC, we've spent MANY HOURS trying all sorts of different things to get this thing to run smoothly, never once did we EVER reach turn 100 with just 2players without one of our games crashing, stalling, freezing, or some sort of issue that caused us to have to reboot the entire client, reload the game lobby, and start from an autosave. Very frustrating, there's so much potential here, just need someone to lead the efforts that can think bigger picture, they needed to tackle all the games ancillary stuff years ago instead of adding new little quirky things to the game.

metacritic,MikeTepelus,sid-meiers-civilization-vi,"Sid Meier's series continues to dazzle us, history and Turn-Based Strategy addicts, with the 6th installment of the Civilization franchise.

I admit I had played the previous ones, starting Civ2, but usually hadn't played more than several maps, usually just one.
This time, with Civ6, it made no difference.

However, the brightness and amplitude of the Civilization series is again in the front-line of gaming.
It isn't a fast paced FPS, nor a MOBA, but if you are keen on building cities, nations and long term careers, this game is for you.

I had some pleasant time spent playing Civilization 6 and I may be return to it, sooner or later, for another map with glorious historical leaders and well animated units.",10,10
metacritic,HaloFever,sid-meiers-civilization-vi,"At least it is a Civilization game. When Civ 6 was released, I was skeptical of the ugly cartoonish art style and the district system. After playing on iPad and now on PC (technically Mac), I am still skeptical. Though not as bad as Civ 3, Civ 6 has some of the worst changes in the series.

The game kind of looks like Civilization, but instead of playing as some kind of world history, global conflict simulator, the game plays like a board game that has a too few many rules. Instead of government, you have card that you play. Government is essentially meaningless. Choices are meaningless. What matters is using cards and board piece placement to maximize bonuses and then hitting end turn until you gain enough points in whatever to win.

The district system is interesting and not in a good way. Instead of building improvements in a city, improvements are spread across the map. This means that wonders of the world like the Great Library will take up 100 square miles of land. (Maybe they need the space for parking.) It also means that if you want to build a library to increase science, you first have to build a campus and then a library. You can't just choose library and have the campus auto-built with it. (The delayed gratification if found throughout the game. Build a Missionary or a Rock Band and then waste its first turn giving it a promotion.) Need a quick boost to happiness? First you have to build an entertainment district before building an arena. How do the citizens feel about this? They have to drive 100s of miles to get from their neighborhood to the factory district. The whole district system is mocked by the game itself when builders have the options of making seaside resorts and solar farms without the need for a district.

2K Games undercut the districts (and wonders) with the changes to how cities gain points for victory. Civ V went too far in the direction of fewer cities built big (tall gameplay). Civ VI goes to far the other way with no limit on the number of cities (wide gameplay). Every game benefits from investing in settlers to found more cities. Why build a district when you can build a whole new city? Why build an industrial zone when you can have more mines? The developers are hell bent on cost benefit so no mechanic is broken. But when every mechanic is nerfed, none of the mechanics matter.

Civ 6 also kills many quality of life changes enjoyed in previous Civ games. A player cannot automate a city, so a world winning wide empire leads to toiling in tedious torment. Even in Civ V, which championed small empires, you could take over the entire world and set up all the captured cities as puppet governments. The a.i. would prioritize gold in every captured city and that was fine because gold is useful. Civ 6 doesn't even have an option to set the city to auto-generate projects like making more science.

War is not great but it does include many of the strategic advancements from Civ 5. The barbarians in the early game are a nightmare. They always have the best weapons and generate 3 or 4 units at a time. It's like the early rushes from Aztecs in Civ 5, only now every game has a rush. Because builders must be rebuilt after every 3 uses, pillaging is a real pain in the ass. Units are so broken out by era that by the time you build an army to deal with a threat, it becomes obsolete. Meanwhile, the barbarians you marched toward for the last 20 turns are spawning the latest gunpowder units. Just so fun for players. And because 2K Games didn't know it wanted for strategic gameplay, armies are back.

Did I mention the terrible selection of leaders? I like that addition of new and interesting leaders. I don't like the removal of old favorites like Caesar, Napoleon, and Lincoln. And please stop releasing games in a sad state only to sell the players more content with DLC packs. This is why I always wait so long to buy games. (Full disclosure: my son bought Civ 6 with all the DLC. I've been playing it through the Steam family sharing feature. )

There are good additions. The district system means a player can plop down Golden Gate Bridge between two landmasses or dig a canal through a continent. Spies are more useful than Civ 5. Religious combat is its own thing (maybe too much its own thing). All-in-all, Civ 6 is the kind of Civ release that really makes you think ""When is the next one?""",6,10
metacritic,Viserege,sid-meiers-civilization-vi,"As a very experienced Civilization V player I really liked the new mechanics that 2K brought to the game. I think with the new culture tree system is much better than the previous game and compared to the Civilization V this game is much more detailed no doubt.
The reason why I didn't like this game is completely because of the IA I am playing against. It is not challenging at all. There are difficulty options for sure but those options are not about the intellegence of the IA. They only give IA bonus adventages against you. For example at the hardest difficulty of the game I can survive to the end of the game by just not attacking anybody. With a little bit of a land advantage you can beat a division of modern technology tanks using some archers of ancient era.
In summary, I really liked the game generally but the non-challenging IA made me bored after some time of playing. If there where a good IA in the game this game might have been one of the best games I have ever played.",3,10

To top it off people brainwashed by the game and it's occult like marketing make it seem like treason by it's community for calling out stuff is inexcusable for a triple AAA live service game holding the game further back and creating an illusion of security that doesn't incentivise the devs to push to make serious changes on feedback that are not minor but are the longer lasting changes for gameplay stability and future updates unlike the DSS issue. 

I would be more forgiving  if this was a smaller game sales wise (3rd highest selling in America)  but this is unforgivable and the devs really need to stop trying to be wizards getting this game to work on an defunct game engine which I suspect is causing too many issues and stopping the idea living to its full potential. as the best way of explaining it is like the hitman series with freelancer being their final vision but these guys are like in ps1 hitman terrory.  for those  if you haven't played hitman; what I am saying is the sophistication of gameplay is not there and it gets very repetitive and they are heavily trapped by their game engine from what it looks (or possibility other resource pr technically constraints) like from easily implementing their vision. I don't doubt this concept is a good one but I can see this game being capable of so much more if they had regular updates and not just band aids for updates in the form of war bonds , the game needs new enemies or mission types or other types of game play dynamics badly over weapon drops and changes. I do feel the co- op element could have a lot more potential as it seems there's not many rewards or fun in co-operation in the game yes you're a team but rare moments where you leverage teamwork skills like using the recoilless rifle as a pair or opening doors 

When they add new weapons or war bonds, it is like adding more topping to this metaphorical pizza but it doesn't fix the fact that the gameplay lacks evolution and the missions feel the same, nor does it add more fun to the game. I got all the upgrades over a 3/4 month period to my ship but seeing that after illuminates dropping December after I was already bored playing the game.

you may feel I am being harsh but I do feel there isn't many people speaking out about the long standing issues with the game but I don't think the concept itself is bad but just very poorly executed in terms of updates and the number of bugs faced by gamers, alongside the lack of the evolution of the gameplay but over a period of months ... and combined with its sly marketing of stuff that's calling out stuff that is genuinely not okay as treason is brainwashing ....  I don't feel for ps5 gamers after certain point this game is worth keeping as the online play barely evolves and feels all the same after you spend enough time on the game regardless of upgrades or collecting samples I don't think this game is worth paying for playstation plus for solely",1,10

Sometimes I can't get out of the vehicle, sometimes camera becomes first person view without any scope or something and I can do nothing to fix this except getting killed by teammates or enemies. And many more other bugs like ragdolling through map after one shot and grenades that are passing through bigger enemies.

metacritic,PMG-Writer,helldivers-2,"My conclusion about “Helldivers 2” is very good and appealing. “Helldivers 2” is best fun when you have a functioning team and every player completes their tasks. In addition, the missions are not particularly exciting as a single player. I also think it's very good, kudos to the developers, if you buy a version of ""Helldivers 2"" you can also use it on the other platforms. From a technical perspective, the PS5 version of the game comes out best. Unfortunately there is also the nervous issue of microtransactions, but you should decide for yourself.

metacritic,RomaNomak,helldivers-2,"Это один из тех случаев, когда ты смотришь на трейлер и не понимаешь как такую хрень можно выпускать. Игра не цепляла меня ни визуалом, ни геймплеем, ни экшеном, вообще ничем. Но когда она вышла и я увидел настоящий непостановочный геймплей от настоящих игроков, то сразу попал на ее крючок. Добрые люди в лице подписчика Петровича помогли быстро приобрести игру и отправиться нести демократию в космических просторах. Больше всего, наверное, в игре меня зацепил импакт. Буквально все сделано таким образом, чтобы максимально погрузить игрока в локацию и перестрелки. Ты буквально чувствуешь свое оружие, окружение, взрывы и поэтому словно сам оказываешься в крутом фантастическом боевике. Стратагемы же с помощью которых можно разбомбить здания и превосходящие силы противника вообще просто сносили мне крышу. Это и выглядит эффектно, и работает эффективно. А если бы разработчикам удалось реализовать еще и изменение ландшафта от взрывов, вроде образование воронок или уничтожения скал и прочих естественных возвышений, то эффектность возросла бы кратно. Первое время хотелось просто призывать стратагемы и смотреть как красиво происходит взрыв. Подкупило в игре еще и то, что разработчики постоянно подкидывали новый контент, будь то новое оружие, стратагемы, виды врагов или типы заданий. Поэтому постоянно хотелось возвращаться в игру и пробовать эти новинки. На данный момент самым ожидаемым обновлением является введение третьей фракции, которая была в первой части и когда это произойдет, уверен, что миллионы игроков по всему миру снова вернутся в игру, чтобы защитить Суперземлю от Суперугрозы.",9,10

metacritic,TeeMoz734,helldivers-2,"Helldivers 2 is a fresh and exhilarating launch into the PvE shooter genre that not many other games have been able to capitalise on. The updates being given to balance the less loved weapons and strategems is what is keeping the game from being lost and forgotten and was a welcome change from the usual developers not listening to the players that so many other games suffer from. The feeling of a patriotic last-stand holdout to accomplish a common goal is what drives players to want to continue with the gameplay loop of this game. Warbonds provide excellent bonuses that making player engagement worthwhile and give good bonuses to the most dedicated of divers while not forgetting about those divers that have less time to participate with the much loved idea of not sunsetting the content put out, something Destiny 2 had made a mistake with. The feeling of calling down perfectly coordinated combined arms fire onto enemies provides a rush that keeps players wanting more and more. The only issue that this game can be faulted with is simply sample requirements for the super-destroyer bonuses being a bit demanding as sometimes missions don't go the way expected and can lead to a frustrating loss of samples. But this doesn't adversely affect the game at large as it's experience of ""gaming with the boys/girls, no worries"" that 2012 Call of Duty style gameplay loop is still provided to a standard that exceeds expectations. Would highly recommend this game for those that want to party up and take on the most dangerous threats to Super Earth or want to have a chill game experience after work.",8,10

metacritic,stonethewriter,helldivers-2,"This is the greatest co-op shooter since Left 4 Dead. The game is a third person shooter with the option to aim down sights. One of the most compelling mechanics of the game are stratagems. You have to call in a code on the d-pad and then throw a beacon. You can choose from flamethrowers, rocket launchers, machine guns, turrets, an orbital laser, missiles, and so much more. The game is live service so content is added to the game. The enemies that you fight are the terminids and the automatons. Each brings its own type of tactical challenge.
 The story is progressed from the collective actions of the players. Sometimes there is only enough time to save one planet so you must either choose to save children in a hospital or a factory with plans for mines. Each week the story slowly progresses and evolves the gameplay. I highly recommend this game because it’s one to regularly check-in on due to how much they add. This has been one of my favorite games of all time because of the amount of friends that I’ve made and the hours of enjoyment that it has brought. I bought a PlayStation 5 so I could play this game explicitly, but I’ve been enjoying the other exclusives as I wait for new updates or warbonds.

So many games today are grossly overpriced, Helldivers 2 is for sure not one of those games. It's also also not oversaturated with microtransactions like so many games these days as well.

metacritic,Bahia8000,helldivers-2,"One of my fav mp ever. Helldivers 2 is an impressive glow up from the first game. Its setting is comparable to starship troopers, its an obvious satire of military the ugly bugs and comunists automatons threaten super earth's children, freedom and so loved democracy so you must erradicate them and extract ther valued rescources too all in the name of democracy. Incredibly fun concept followed with a sublime gameplay with a lot of elements cleverly mashed together. The ship is simple but seeing the vastness of space, moving at full velocity and your crew working is euphoric. In gameplay you have mechanics related to other shooters, stand, run, crouch and prone with also the incredibly fun dive and the option to see in first person while aiming like metal gear solid and with a dynamic fast and inmersive system to call mayhem called stratagems, spheres beacons that call powerfull weapons sentrys and all kind of artillery that never fails to satisfy your thirst for managing democracy while thinking on the children. Planets are very good, quite a bit of biomes each with effects such as a fire tornado, torrential rainstorms or an ion storm and the auto generated planet system is incredible, biome is the same but it always feels so diferent all the terrrain and place of points of interest. General stuff is incredible, animations and attention to detail unseen in games of this kind, weapons pack a punch with incredible desing from a sound to a visual perspective, each weapon is treated with care. Enemies are good each with a good variety of types and unique objectives that rewards you properly. Online play is PERFECT i have played with people from all the continents and never experienced lag, literally the best netcode i have ever seen at least on a coop pve game. Ragdoll and friendly fire makes a lot of funny moments and since dying isnt too punishing you just laugh at it. There is a lot to like in this game, monetization wise you have battle passes esentially but you cant pay to complete them faster and no time limit, they are also free, since premium currency can be acquired in game, without grinding it will take you a bit (except at the begining because battle pass 1 gives you a lot of credits) weeks if you play consistenly even but if you want to farm them or grind them you can easily get a battle pass in just 1 or 2 hours, at worst 3. Its magical, its comunity is great and united for freedom, you can be creative and a lot of future content awaits, what are you waiting for citizen? become a helldiver today, make your family safety a personal responsibility and fight for the people, the children, freedom, friends, for mayhem but avobe all FOR MANAGED DEMOCRACY",10,10

metacritic,KP1K,helldivers-2,"Not perfect, but no game is, some complain about the balancing but they  aren't very good at this game, when I get home this is my #1 game to launch and play with friends. The story is ongoing so join the battle for democracy!",10,10
metacritic,Funny7Cloud,helldivers-2,"地狱潜兵2本体是一款非常棒的游戏，当然它存在着当今游戏圈的各种通病包括优化，bug以及非常少的内容。但相信我，它是好玩的，尤其是有朋友一起的时候。
但是现在它已经是一款AH用来恶心玩家的产品了，仿佛一切都是用来恶心玩家们的。它不在是一款好玩的游戏，以至于让我非常怀疑当初制作游戏本体的根本不是AH，至少现在这个工作室对游戏是没有最基本的理解的。",0,10
metacritic,CrazyHaste,helldivers-2,"It was a really good game, but since the last update it is unplayable.
The cool weapons aren't playable anymore, because of weapon ""balancing"" (There is nothing balanced in this game anymore).
You disconnect mid match, even with a good internet connection, bc the servers could be compared to servers from 20 years ago (and the 20 yo servers would stillbe better).
And you can experience big issues if you trying to join a friend.

So i would not recommend playing the game in the state it is right now, it's just not fun to play.",3,10
metacritic,GoBro445,helldivers-2,"A blast to play with friends and by yourself. It has some really cool enemy designs and mechanics that just immerse you into the world of Helldivers! The only thing that holds it back for me is how repetitive it can get after I’ve played 150+ hours, that’s why I recommend playing it every couple months to not burn out on the game like I did. Other than that this is an amazing game that I will continue to support!",8,10
metacritic,mikerbyrne,helldivers-2,Don't listen to the whiners.  This is a great game.  Nerfs and changes to game play are part of a live service game.  Best 40 bucks I have spent on  gaming all year.  Excited to see what happens when they add a third alien faction.,10,10
metacritic,MarkusZ91,helldivers-2,"While I Genuinely love the game and have definitely gotten my money out of it... it baffles me how uncooperative the Devs are and how deaf they are when time and time again we as player base have mentioned that they should stop nerfing all the fun out of it.
this is a PvE game, not PvP, the sooner they understand that the better, sadly... they've lost a lot of goodwill from their players.",3,10

metacritic,Gladvicci,helldivers-2,"It would be a fun game but the devs seem to ruin it more and more with each update. I encounter a ridiculous amount of glitches in this game as well. Mission stratagems that just won't appear, locking you from completing. They've promised features that will never arrive and in general the whole thing is just a mess. I would stay away if you are thinking of purchasing.",2,10
metacritic,Robzomby30,helldivers-2,"The developers keep messing with the game to make it more ‘fun.’  All they are doing is ruining it.  I have over 500 hours in this game and I’m done with the constant ‘fixes’ that just mess everything up. How about giving the players firepower to actually be a threat to the enemies? No? Ok, cool.",3,10
metacritic,Madmojo,helldivers-2,"After the escalation of freedom update.. The game is just no longer fun to play. So many other people have already said it, they took everything that's not fun about the game and tripled it well taking your ability to handle it away",2,10
metacritic,xdeadpool83x,helldivers-2,"Why do you guys do this.... With each update, you keep putting your player base in a corner, forcing them to have to use weapons and things they don't want to.... you keep nerfing and running everything into the ground the moment someone starts having fun. 
""OH BUT WE BUFFED THIS ONE, SO USE THAT INSTEAD"" 
""OH BUT THAT WAS POPULAR SO WE HAD TO CHANGE IT""
No. We want to use what we're comfortable with, but you guys keep screwing with everything making the joy factor almost non existent and now it just feels like a monotonous, uncomfortable grind and I'm tired of pretending like I'm having a good time anymore. I have coped enough for you guys. Yall used to listen to us, but now it's like you all have just done a complete 180° turn on your fans. I want to know why. I spent my money on this game when it released like everyone else here, and we deserve better from you guys. You've managed to completely ruin what used to be a great experience, and are losing the trust of your customers and player base.",1,10
metacritic,Stcoppin60,helldivers-2,"Je n'aime pas du tout ce genre de jeu, aucun intérêt et risque de tomber dans l'oubli aussi vite qu'il est venu",3,10
metacritic,HalM,helldivers-2,"There are no campain, no story But Excellent gameplay and atmospher ,may be the best one in the game history,. 
First of all, It is obvious that Helldivers 2 is not perfect game to play it. Many deficients such as don't having campain or story. However, the game made perfect things to cover these kind of deficients, atmospher and comminication with the other play you played as a 4 player group.
Opponnets comming in the mission is perfect you can fell that you are fighting as a soldier in area, not as a gamer on pc. you can run out last bullut and have to wait for reinforcment with nothing. HOWEVER there is most important fact that developers of the game can not ignore or give attention it. New contents everytime. If they be late to get new contents to game, numbers of the gamers can sharply reduce.",9,10
metacritic,nono007paca,helldivers-2,"After 50h playing I am rather disappointed with Helldivers 2.
The good
- shooting feels great
- wide choice of weapons/stratagems
- co-op can be satisfying

The bad
- repetitive
- at some point it feels there is no more progression 
- while I have met some great guys online, some other players are jerk and make you want to play something else",4,10

metacritic,notjoeyhunt,helldivers-2,"Overhyped, I just do not like anything aside from the lore and the community. Those two each get a 4/5.
For a good example of my grievance, I had to abort at the very tail end of a lengthy mission because an enemy spawned inside of rocks and wouldn't/couldn't die and it was the 1 remaining enemy I had left to eliminate before I could head to the extraction point.",2,10
metacritic,sneaky_boy_dk,helldivers-2,The game has overall insane potential but the amount of bugs makes it somewhat annoying to play I didn’t expect this amount of bugs in a okay big studio and isn’t in early access,7,10

metacritic,Scorpionking144,helldivers-2,"The game started out as a good challenge, and for a time seemed like it was going to be staying that way as each update gave new challenges to overcome, and slight tweaks to the games mechanics to amplify existing challenges. It was the first time ive played an FPS that felt like a Dark Souls style shooter, and i fell in love. All of the guns and weapons at your disposal were capable of getting kills, but felt juuuust not good enough that you had to use your entire arsenal every game, and you had to do so in sync with your team.

Unfortunately with the more recent updates, this feeling has started to go away, as anymore, even the highest difficulties are completable while only using a primary weapon, and a couple strategems (power moves), and solo playing the game in its most extreme fashion. I find myself intentionally bringing the gear that i dont enjoy using, just to get any kind of challenge.

Another factor into this games rating comes in part due to its structure, but also in part due to the community. Certain weapons and strategems are only given upon completion of major orders, which is fine, however completion of the major order is dependant on the entire community wanting the same thing. So, if you see a weapon that would fit perfect with your build, looks fun, or hey, maybe your maxed out on everything and just want something new to play with, if the community decides they dont want that item, or wants a different one, or even just dont like that planet/enemy, them playing different missions still hurts your efforts to unlock that item. This becomes a huge issue when half of the community openly refuses to fight one of the two enemies, and that enemy gets an MO in their territory, because not only are those players not helping you, them playing the game on different planets is actively slowing down your progress on a timed MO. 

Progress happens with or without you, im not sure whether i like or dont like this feature, but since this is a review i will mention it, you can put the game down for 3 weeks, and when you log back in, you will be awarded medals for the MOs that were completed even though you didnt do anything. Ive logged in many times and had my medals immediatley maxed out. This is nice because the game is always evolving and its good they try to keep you caught up, but at the same time takes away some of the spice of earning it for yourself.

The game seems to go hand in hand with an online presence if you want to keep up with a story line, which if youre only playing the game, there really isnt a story at all, its just mission, after mission.

All in all, i did really enjoy this game for what it looked like it was going to become, i know i am the minority of the fan base with these complaints, and i dont expect things to change in my favor. As most of my friends have also moved onto other team games, i will most likely be putting this game down for good, and using the space on my hard drive for something else.

Also, just to get my part in, give those 170+ countries access back into the game.",2,10
metacritic,adamtheclark,helldivers-2,People seem to forget that Arrowhead did not know they were about to capture lightning in a bottle. There's new content rolling out and the devs are also learning how to make the game the best it can be. It's a fantastic game that can entertain and well as infuriate.,9,10
metacritic,PS,helldivers-2,Beat it 100%  i like it a lot we need Venicles and more big maps with bugs and event from Ropobots like Terminators,10,10
metacritic,jdmsjmsrscgm,helldivers-2,"Helldivers 2 builds on the foundations of its predecessor, delivering an engaging cooperative experience despite some controversies surrounding decisions made by Sony. Developed by Arrowhead Game Studios, thisshooter continues to captivate players with its dynamic storytelling and community-driven missions, though it faces challenges in content pacing and long-term **** of the standout features of Helldivers 2 is its evolving narrative. The game's story progresses based on the outcomes of community missions, creating a sense of collective achievement and consequence. Successful missions advance the story in positive ways, while failures introduce new challenges and obstacles. This system fosters a deep sense of involvement among players, making each mission feel impactful and contributing to the overall war **** cooperative gameplay remains a strong point, emphasizing teamwork and strategy. Players must coordinate their efforts to complete objectives and fend off waves of enemies, making communication and collaboration crucial. The game's difficulty can be punishing, but this only adds to the satisfaction of overcoming its challenges with a well-coordinated team.However, one of the major drawbacks of Helldivers 2 is the slow pace of content updates. While the base game offers plenty of excitement and variety, the delay in adding new content can leave dedicated players feeling unfulfilled once they have achieved everything available. This lack of timely updates risks making the game less appealing for those who have already invested significant time and effort, potentially leading to a drop in player engagement.Additionally, the game has faced backlash from the community regarding certain decisions made by Sony. These issues, while external to the gameplay itself, have influenced the perception and reception of the game. Despite these concerns, Helldivers 2 manages to maintain a dedicated player base through its strong core mechanics and engaging mission structure.",9,10
