Rotten Tomatoes,Hex x,Dune 2021,"Took me a while to get into it, but as someone who has not read the Dune books, it truly feels like a book. I can see the influence and see how the book must have been like, I definitely plan to read the books at some point. Some of the decisions are a bit sub-par though. They should 100% have had a different cast. Yes, sure, they chose some good actors, but starring Zendaya in something like this is an absolute no. And I LOVE David Batista, but all I could think any time he appeared on screen, is Oh Look David Batista. You have to cast less known actors in big fantasy movies like this, because it just takes the watcher out of the movie, it takes you OUT of the beautiful world building when Zendaya with weird eyes appears on screen every so often. Completely jolts you out of the fantasy and back to ""Oh. Zendaya looks kinda weird in this movie."" or ""haha look its David Batista"".",3.5,5
Rotten Tomatoes, ,Dune 2021,"This might be my favorite movie !
Dune (2021) is a sci-fi movie adapted from a roman directed by Dennis Villeneuve with Timothée chalamet as Paul Atréides  and Zendaya as Chani

In Dune(2021) Paul Atréides follows his very important and powerful family to the desertic planet of Arrakis gifted by the Imperium , where a very important ressource is collected and put on the market, but after an conspiracy and a betrayal Paul have to flee on the planet where he will met the native désert’s people, the Fremen

The actors were chosen perfectly and respected the physical descriptions given in the roman with the exception of some like Liet Kynes who was played by a woman. I also loved the makeup art on the Harkonnen family and the Eyes of Ibad

The film technique were amazing ! I think we cannot represent Arrakis better than they did , the lighting were very good on the desert and the pictures and ambiance were perfect 
The soundtrack by Hans Zimmer was flawless !
I really loved the costumes, from the Paul outfit on Caladan or Jessica outfit on the Arrakis arrival to the distille and Harkonnen Armor
And that’s why this movie won 6 oscars for 10 nominations

Dune explore theme like ecology power and colonialism.The film shows how the struggle for the rare ressource spice touch political, economic, and cultural conflicts, mirroring real-world tensions over oil and natural resources.  And my favorite theme is religion because its a big interest to me at this moment in my life, i love debatting about religion, learning about the story of religion so i absolutly loved the religion thème and everything its brings to the story 

Finally i really recommend to the movie watcher to try to read dune !!! Even though the adaptation is perfect in therm of cinematography i think the plot is very hard to fully understand and the movie miss a lot of scene and aspect of the story . So as a lover of Dune universe i fully recommend the book before watching the movie !",5,5

Rotten Tomatoes,Stefano T,Dune 2021,"Not bad. I still prefer the classic one from 1984 though (which I've just rewatched). I can't make comparisons with the books because I didn't read them, so I don't know how much the films differ from the original story. I can only make a comparison with the first film and I definitely liked more the characters of that one. I've found them having more personality. In this one I find the characters more ""flat"". It's still not bad though, good special effects and interesting lore",3,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Brad F,Dune 2021,"A slogfest of a story, without any exciting moments to consider this movie memorable. The 1.5 stars are for the fact that the movie is undeniably beautiful with incredible sound. Feels like this movie was made to set up for the vastly superior second chapter.",1.5,5

Rotten Tomatoes, ,Dune 2021,"The plot, though unhurried, twist into a tense and rattling spring, which shoots at the end of the movie, breaking off the narrative at the most intense and promising point. At the end I was pretty sure that the filmmakers will do 2-3 more movies to tell the Dune (the  first book) story. 
The closeness of the plot to the original book story gives a good credit to the film makers. 
While Oscar plays the role of Duke Leto perfectly, Zendaya either does not fit into the role of Chani, or does not cope with it ...",4,5

Rotten Tomatoes, ,Dune 2021,"This film, based on Frank Herbert’s novel of the same name, follows Paul, heir to the noble House Atreides, as his family takes control of the planet Arrakis, home to the mysterious Fremen. However, between the planet’s harsh climate, the threat of dangerous sandworms, and their ruthless enemies, the Harkonnens—who seek to control the invaluable spice found only on Arrakis—House Atreides finds itself waging a battle on two fronts, both political and military, in a war for peace, the future of their house, and the fate of the Imperium. Overall, due to it's breathtaking cinematography and expert direction (no one does it like Villeneuve) [looks beautiful, an impressive task for a film primarily set in a desert], Zimmer's epic score, immersive sound design, fluid, and well choreographed fight sequences, and rich lore with grandiose world-building, this movie is really good, and although it can feel a little slow or confusing at times (Usually due to heavy exposition), and the lack of action scenes (thankfully addressed in the sequel), I still enjoyed this feature, and found myself appreciating it even more upon a second viewing, and even though I slightly prefer Dune: Part Two, this picture is a fantastic introduction to the universe that I thoroughly enjoyed my time with.",4,5

Inception blew my mind. The idea of dreams inside dreams was super cool, and the action scenes were awesome. It made me think a lot, but it was still fun to watch. The ending was wild, I’m still not sure what really happened, and I love that. Definitely one of the best movies I’ve seen.",5,5

Rotten Tomatoes,João Vinícius A,Inception,"Nolan is not a director I usually follow. But there was this film, and somehow it called to me as if to say ""I'm good, and you're going to love me."" He was right. It's a good film, I loved it, but the thing is: I only loved it for its 148 minutes, after that, little by little I forgot about it or started caring about other things. Inception didn't have the impact I would expect from the director named one of the best of our time, but it served up a feast of science fiction and action with the most beautiful formula.",4,5

Expertly crafted dream sequences, an intriguing sci-fi concept with endless possibilities, well set up plot twists, a complex and well thought out plotline, an emotional arc for the main characters and amazing performances by the cast, specially Dicaprio and Cillian Murphy.

Bottom line, this is a tedious 2.5 hours of your typical Super Hero film - graphic and more  graphics in search of a story.",1.5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Jens B,Inception,"""Inception"" is the first film I've seen by Christopher Nolan. Fifteen years ago, I was deeply impressed, and today—with a little more viewing experience—I still am. A key reason for this is probably my love of heist movies, and ""Inception"" is a very entertaining example of this genre. I also think the way the idea is implanted in Cillian Murphy's mind is very well done. And while Di Caprio's story bloats the film, it doesn't take the wind out of its sails. With a running time of almost three hours, I was never bored even after watching it for the fourth time.

Why this particular film became one of the biggest pop cultural events of the 2010s, I can't explain. For me, it's the fascinating paradox of Nolan as a filmmaker: He always manages to squeeze a lot of money out of big studios for rather cerebral ideas, or rather, sell them to a mainstream audience. He shoots on film in the traditional way, using VFX only where necessary, and even occasionally letting a train drive through a crowded street. His scripts are almost over-engineered, so much so that when you watch the film, you notice its architecture; the characters often say unnatural things and/or regularly throw in such obvious exposition/explanations/etc. that even the last person in the theater understands what's happening and why. This allows you to follow the film without thinking too much and simply have a good time.

Because, ultimately, I believe Nolan is all about creating emotions. In his very own, technocratic way. And that's also the reason why I've never understood why there are so many explainer videos about his films. What are they trying to explain to me about ""Inception""? Whether the spinning top falls or not? That question still leaves me cold to this day.",4,5
Rotten Tomatoes,JD L,Inception,This has to be the most incredible movie I’ve ever seen. It’s something that I’d love to watch over and over because there is so much that I want to dig deeper into. The idea is kind of trippy but I love it.,5,5

Rotten Tomatoes,Sergio A,Interstellar 2014,"I’m a fan of Nolan’s work, but I find this film to be highly overrated.

Easily one of the most powerful films I’ve ever seen.",5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Aalekh D,Interstellar 2014,"Interstellar is hands down my favorite movie. As someone who's deeply interested in science, space, and research, it completely blew my mind.

Rotten Tomatoes,Paul S,Fight Club,This movie was thrilling to the very end. I had so much fun watching it. I highly recommend it!,5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Callum C,Fight Club,"“Fight Club” is a fascinating exploration of masculinity, consumerism, and mental health, capturing the anxieties of its time while remaining highly relevant today. The film critiques the predictability of modern life and the way consumer culture—now amplified by social media—has turned people into passive participants rather than active creators. In an increasingly feminized society, where is the masculine outlet?

The final act is particularly striking, illustrating how unchecked masculine ideals can turn toxic when left without purpose or direction. The film raises important questions: Why do men seek out struggle, conflict, or meaning in a world that no longer values traditional masculinity? And when that search fails, how does it manifest—through self-destruction, rebellion, or even violent crime? Fight Club doesn’t provide easy answers, but it forces us to confront the consequences of a society that offers men little space to express themselves in a way that feels meaningful.",5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Mikas S,Fight Club,badass but at the same time an interesting take on mens mental health and toxic masculinity. all over great executed and fantastic cinematic easter egs. would 100% recommend a second watch at the minimum.,5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Simon D,Fight Club,"A masterpiece of original techniques and ideas. One of those films that you talk about for hours and years after you watched it, clearly says what everyone has been thinking for ages (violence is a necessity and can be enjoyable through it's practicality and resulting capability), and gets better each time you watch it because you discover hidden meaning or deepen you understanding of others.

Rotten Tomatoes,Megan D,Pulp Fiction,"Pulp Fiction (1994), directed by Quentin Tarantino, is a MUST WATCH masterpiece that redefined movies and still stands as one of the greatest films ever made. If you love gripping stories, unforgettable characters , iconic scenes. This is for you. The nonlinear plot weaves tales of hitmen Vincent (John Travolta) and Jules (Samuel L. Jackson), boxer Butch (Bruce Willis), and the magnetic Mia (Uma Thurman) into a thrilling, unpredictable ride. Tarantino’s razor-sharp dialogue, dark humor, and perfect blend of surf rock and soul music create a world you can’t look away from. It’s no surprise it won the Palme d’Or and an Oscar for Best Screenplay. Watch it to see why it’s a cultural icon that’s as fresh now as it was 30 years ago.

Rotten Tomatoes,Friendrick M,Pulp Fiction,"Pulp Fiction is a movie directed by Quentin Tarentino, the mains actors are John Travolta, Uma Thurman, Samuel L Jackson and Bruce Willis and it was released in 1994. 
In that movie we follow a lot of main characters that have different stories but they are all connected. We have the story of Vincent Vega, Jules and Marcellus Wallas who are hitmans then we have the story of Butch who is a Boxer that threatened Marcellus Wallas and finally the story of a couple of robbers that want to hold up a restaurant. The 3 stories are going to meet and will make only one. 
The acting is perfect, we know that the cast of that movie is only big heads of hollywood during that time. Vincent Vega is my personal favorite one because his character is just perfect for the manner that he plays. All the actors did such a good job and their plays sees really realistic. 
the Film technique are very complex like all other Tarentino movies. First the movie is composed by multiples chapters that don't have a link and they are introduced by an iconic music as always.
For the film message I would say that it don't really have one but it's such an amazing movie ! Even tho it lasts 3 hours you won't be bored ! The thing that makes me love that movie is the film technique with the chapters and you should watch it !",4,5

Also, the movie gives you a message to love unconditionally. It gives you everything in one movie, a motivational massage, drama, comedy, and a bunch of emotions in just one film.

Rotten Tomatoes,Chris H,Forrest Gump,"Alright, so in my opinion, Forrest Gump is hands-down the best movie ever made—no contest. It’s the only flick that hits every single vibe: it makes you laugh, cry, feel angry, sad, and straight-up stoked. Like, it’s a full-on emotional ride from start to finish.

Tom Hanks as Forrest is next level. The dude just lives his life, keeps it simple, and somehow ends up being part of all this crazy, historic stuff. He’s got this epic love for Jenny (Robin Wright), but let’s be real—Jenny treats Forrest like absolute trash. She’s out there making bad choices, leaving him behind, and only comes back when she’s at rock bottom. Honestly, she’s the real villain of the story because of how bad she treats him. But somehow, Forrest still loves her, and that’s what makes his character so pure and unshakable.

What really makes Forrest Gump stand out is how it just nails every feeling. One second you’re cracking up over his shrimp talk, the next you’re tearing up during the heavy moments. It’s deep, but it doesn’t shove it in your face—just like, “Here’s life. Deal with it.” And man, the soundtrack? Absolute fire.

If you haven’t seen it, you’re seriously missing out. It’s a straight classic that’s gonna hit you in ways you don’t expect. Life’s like a box of chocolates, dude—you never know what you’re gonna get, but this movie’s a guaranteed banger.",5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Ricardo B,Forrest Gump,"Eu tenho uma lista muito seleta de filmes que eu considero verdadeiramente mágicos. Esse é um dos filmes dessa lista. A história é levemente clichê e previsível? Sim, um pouco. A narrativa, em partes, é melodramática e emocionalmente manipuladora? Às vezes. E este filme, mesmo imperfeito, devia ter levado o Oscar de Melhor Filme no lugar de ""Um Sonho de Liberdade"" (1994)? Provelmente, não. Mas é indiscutível, inegável e inevitável a magia de ""Forrest Gump: O Contador de Histórias"". E essa magia é resultado da inovadora mente de Robert Zemeckis, um diretor que, ao longo de sua carreira, frequentemente arriscou e levou além as tecnologias de efeitos viuais, da linda trilha sonora de Alan Silvestri e da simplória e, ao mesmo tempo, profundamente complexa atuação de Tom Hanks.",4.5,5

Rotten Tomatoes, ,The Godfather,"In the vast pantheon of cinematic art, there are few works that stand with such gravitas, such enduring significance, and such meticulous craftsmanship as *The Godfather: Part I*. Directed by Francis Ford Coppola and adapted from the novel by Mario Puzo, this film is not merely a triumph of storytelling—it is a masterwork of aesthetic composition, character development, moral inquiry, and historical resonance. It is a tale at once deeply intimate and broadly mythological, a parable of power, loyalty, transformation, and the dark undercurrents of the American dream.

From the very first frames, *The Godfather* sets itself apart. The opening scene, in which the undertaker Amerigo Bonasera petitions Don Vito Corleone for justice, is emblematic of the film’s entire spirit—measured, deliberate, and steeped in tradition, honour, and the implicit codes of a world unseen by most. The lighting is subdued, the dialogue unhurried, and the mood heavy with portent. It is here, in this dimly lit study, that we are introduced to a world where justice is personal, where power is wielded not through public institutions but through whispered favours and silent debts. The film is not in a hurry to unfold its story, and rightly so—for the world it paints is one in which patience is not merely a virtue, but a necessity.

Indeed, it must be said at the outset that *The Godfather* is a film of deliberate pacing. It does not conform to the demands of modern sensibilities which too often favour immediacy and constant motion. Rather, it moves with a stately grace, confident in the weight of its own story. Those who seek rapid thrills or the quick gratification of action without substance may find its rhythms unfamiliar, even daunting. But to those with the patience to listen, to observe, and to reflect, it offers riches beyond measure.

The film is set in the years following the Second World War, a time of transition and turbulence in American society. The Corleone family, Italian immigrants who have carved out their empire through a combination of shrewd negotiation and calculated violence, stand as a symbol both of the immigrant’s ambition and of the moral compromises that such ambition may demand. Coppola captures this era with extraordinary attention to detail—the costumes, the vehicles, the music, the dialogue, and even the very air seem imbued with authenticity. One feels, not as though one is watching a recreation, but rather as though one has been transported wholesale into another time.

The performances are uniformly magnificent. Marlon Brando’s portrayal of Don Vito Corleone is nothing short of legendary. With his gravelled voice, deliberate mannerisms, and penetrating gaze, Brando embodies a man who is both benevolent patriarch and ruthless strategist—a man whose love for his family is matched only by his willingness to do whatever is necessary to protect them. His presence is so commanding that even in scenes where he says little, the atmosphere bends around him.

Yet while Don Vito may be the titular Godfather, the true arc of the film belongs to his youngest son, Michael, portrayed with astonishing restraint and emotional complexity by Al Pacino. At the film’s outset, Michael is an outsider to the family business—a decorated war hero, a university man, a figure of apparent virtue and detachment. He is the Corleone who is meant to forge a different path, to escape the cycle of violence and secrecy that binds the rest of his kin. But fate, as it so often does in tragedies both ancient and modern, intervenes. Through a series of events both personal and political, Michael is drawn into the heart of the family enterprise.

It is in this gradual transformation that the film finds its most poignant power. We witness, over the course of three hours, a metamorphosis that is both chilling and inevitable. Michael becomes the very thing he once distanced himself from—not out of desire, but out of duty, out of vengeance, and, ultimately, out of an internal shift that he himself scarcely seems to comprehend. By the film’s end, he has assumed his father’s mantle, and in so doing, has lost something irreplaceable—his innocence, his soul, his future as a man unburdened by the weight of blood.

What is most remarkable, perhaps, is the subtlety with which this transformation is rendered. There is no single moment when Michael ""becomes"" the Godfather; rather, it is a thousand tiny moments—a look, a decision, a silence—that accumulate until we realise, almost with dread, that the change has already occurred. Coppola’s direction here is masterful, trusting the audience to perceive the undercurrents rather than pointing to them.

Equally compelling are the characters who orbit around Michael and Don Vito: Sonny, the volatile older brother whose temper proves both a weapon and a weakness; Tom Hagen, the adopted son and trusted consigliere, ever the voice of reason; Kay Adams, Michael’s fiancée, whose disillusionment becomes a silent commentary on the cost of power. Each is drawn with depth and care, and each serves to illuminate a different facet of the family and the world they inhabit.

Thematically, the film explores the tension between personal loyalty and institutional corruption, between family honour and public morality. It asks difficult questions: Is violence justified in the service of order? Can love and cruelty coexist? Is it possible to wield power without being consumed by it? These are not questions with easy answers, and the film wisely refuses to provide them. Instead, it presents its world as it is—complex, contradictory, and heartbreakingly human.

Technically, the film is a marvel. Gordon Willis’s cinematography, often bathed in rich shadows and golden light, lends the film an almost painterly quality. Nino Rota’s haunting score weaves itself through the narrative like a lament, at once romantic and elegiac. Every frame, every note, every movement seems carefully chosen, crafted with reverence for the story being told.

In conclusion, *The Godfather: Part I* is not merely a film—it is a meditation on power, a lament for lost innocence, and a portrait of a family both bound and broken by the very forces that elevate them. It is a slow burn, yes, but one that glows ever brighter as it unfolds, illuminating the darkest corners of the human experience. To those who dismiss it for its pace, I say this: greatness is rarely hurried. And in the case of *The Godfather*, it is precisely in its patience, its poise, and its quiet, smouldering intensity that its true genius lies.

I recommend it, then, without reservation, to any soul who values art that demands something of its audience—attention, reflection, and, above all, time.",4.5,5

Visualmente lindo como uma pintura feita a óleo, brilhantemente atuado e marcado por uma narrativa profundamente ambiciosa e complexa, ""O Poderoso Chefão"" é, para mim, mais que um exímio épico criminal: é uma das maiores obras de artes já feitas.

Rotten Tomatoes, ,Godfather Part Ii,"It is a most singular rarity in the realm of cinematic endeavour when a sequel, rather than merely following in the footsteps of its predecessor, dares to transcend the very work from which it was born. *The Godfather Part II*, directed with masterly precision and unerring instinct by the estimable Francis Ford Coppola, represents not only the continuation of a grand narrative, but a deeper, darker, and far more tragic meditation upon the themes introduced in the first film. If *The Godfather* may be likened to a majestic operatic overture—a tale of power rising from the soil of loyalty and familial duty—then its successor is surely the mournful requiem: a lamentation, not simply for the soul of one man, but for the withering of a dynasty, for the erosion of virtue beneath the relentless march of ambition, and for the bitter solitude that power, once seized and secured, so often entails.

The film, in its structure, is daring and, one might venture, peerlessly original. It unfolds not linearly, but in two elegant and interwoven threads of time. The first follows the figure of Michael Corleone—now undisputed head of the Corleone empire—as he presides over his family's affairs with a cold, inscrutable solemnity. He is a man who, having ascended to the throne left vacant by his father, finds himself ever more entangled in a web of betrayal, moral decay, and increasing isolation. The second thread carries us into the past, to the sun-drenched hills of Sicily and the immigrant slums of early 20th-century New York, where a young Vito Andolini—later to become Vito Corleone—is shaped by tragedy, necessity, and quiet resilience. It is in this juxtaposition—this delicate and deliberate contrast between father and son, between legacy established and legacy corrupted—that the film achieves its most potent and devastating effects.

Robert De Niro’s portrayal of the young Vito is, in a word, sublime. He imbues the character with a quiet nobility, a gentle but unmistakable authority, that recalls Marlon Brando’s original performance not through mimicry, but through deep internal understanding. He speaks seldom, and when he does, his words carry the weight of lived experience and unspoken sorrow. His rise is not that of a man driven by avarice or bloodlust, but rather one compelled by the need to protect, to restore dignity, to build something stable amidst chaos. In contrast, Al Pacino’s Michael is the very embodiment of the tragic sovereign—calm, calculating, impenetrably cool, yet increasingly hollowed out by paranoia and estrangement. His face, once alight with youthful idealism, has become a mask: elegant, expressionless, and profoundly lonely.

It is in the quiet moments that the film most resoundingly speaks—Michael, seated alone in the darkened parlour of his vast estate, contemplating the ruin of all he has endeavoured to preserve; Vito, walking the streets of New York with his infant son, the future of his family nestled in his arms, unaware of the shadow his name shall cast. Such scenes are rendered not with melodrama but with exquisite restraint, underscored by Nino Rota’s haunting score, which weaves like a sorrowful thread through the fabric of the film. The cinematography, too, deserves the highest commendation. Gordon Willis, often hailed as “The Prince of Darkness,” bathes the interiors in sepulchral shadow, invoking both the intimacy and menace that define this world. The visuals do not merely complement the narrative—they amplify it, suffusing each frame with gravitas and mournful splendour.

One must also take note of the performances across the board, for they are uniformly of the highest order. John Cazale, as the pitifully fragile Fredo, delivers a portrayal so deeply moving that it lingers in the mind long after the credits have faded. His final scenes with Michael are among the most heart-wrenching in all of cinema—two brothers, bound by blood yet fatally severed by betrayal. Diane Keaton, too, brings a chilling intensity to the role of Kay Adams, Michael’s long-suffering wife, who delivers, with quiet devastation, the blow that shatters what little remains of Michael’s illusions: the revelation not only of her despair, but of her rejection of the very legacy he has sacrificed so much to secure.

As a meditation on power, *The Godfather Part II* stands alone. It eschews the glamour so often associated with tales of organised crime and instead casts its gaze upon the consequences—the silent toll, the moral rot, the withering of love, trust, and humanity. It asks, with great subtlety and unrelenting sincerity, whether power gained through sacrifice can ever truly be retained without further sacrifice, and whether there comes a point at which the cost renders the triumph meaningless. The film’s final image—Michael, seated utterly alone in the freezing silence of his Lake Tahoe compound, reflecting on a past that slips through his fingers like ash—is among the most haunting in cinematic history. No grand gesture, no violent reckoning, no dramatic collapse—merely a man who has won everything, and lost far more.

To describe this film simply as a sequel would be to diminish its breadth and profundity. It is a Greek tragedy draped in American tailoring, a Shakespearean chronicle of descent, a novel rendered in light and shadow. It rewards patience, introspection, and the willingness to be unsettled. Its artistry lies not only in its craftsmanship but in its moral ambiguity—its refusal to offer clear heroes or villains, its insistence that power does not always wear the face of evil, but often of solemn duty, of inherited responsibility, of justified vengeance.

In sum, *The Godfather Part II* is not merely a film—it is a monument, hewn from the same timeless stone as the greatest works of literature, theatre, and music. It does not cater to the impatient or the casual observer, but for those who yield to its deliberate pace and sombre tone, it offers an experience both intellectually rich and emotionally shattering. It is not entertainment in the common sense—it is enlightenment through tragedy, a masterclass in cinema, and an enduring testament to the complexity of the human soul.

I would, without the slightest hesitation and with the fullest conviction, bestow upon it a rating of five stars out of five—though even such a metric feels woefully inadequate for a work of such rare and majestic calibre.",5,5

Rotten Tomatoes,Ricardo B,Godfather Part Ii,"Antes de qualquer coisa, vamos falar sobre o elefante na sala e tirar do caminho uma opinião considerada controversa, principalmente entre cinéfilos: sim, eu prefiro o primeiro. Isso significa que eu não gosto do segundo? De forma alguma. Apenas significa que eu revejo o primeiro mais frequentemente. Dito isso, vale ressaltar que ""O Poderoso Chefão: Parte II"" é o tipo de filme que, ao longo da minha duradoura paixão pela 7ª arte, eu venho apreciando mais a cada visita, conforme o meu gosto e conhecimento tornam-se mais complexos e profundos. Assistir esse filme e seu antecessor em sequência, como eu fiz recentemente, é uma experiência verdadeiramente impressionante, pois é quase inacreditável como Francis Ford Coppola pode ter acertado tão perfeitamente em dois filmes tão profundamente complexos e ambiciosamente épicos, em um período tão curto de tempo. Não é à toa que tornou-se um hábito referir-se a certos filmes como ""esse é o 'O Poderoso Chefão: Parte II' de tal filme"" ao falar de uma sequência melhor que o filme original, pois ""O Poderoso Chefão: Parte II"" esteleceu, definitivamente, o sarrafo do nível de expansão narrativa que uma sequência pode atingir.

Rotten Tomatoes,Abe A,Godfather Part Ii,"Nowhere near as good as the original. Lacks the form, characterization and relative economy of the original, though it finishes strongly. Not organized around a single conflict and resolution as the original, so seems diffuse and formless.  Not one of De Niro's better performances; he doesn't really give flesh to Vito Corleone in the way Brando did. De Niro's Corleone has no real personality. The entire Vito Corleone sections do not help the movie and could be removed and tightened with a square focus on Mike. The Hyman Roth/Cuba sections are convoluted and probably could be simplified. Michael's characterization becomes monotonous and two-dimensional (because in this long movie, there are greater demands on character which bog down the role); Fredo approaches caricature; Kay and Tom Hagen are relatively consistent, but Kay is invisible through much of the movie. The political stuff, the hearings...is all that necessary? Finishes very strongly, but this movie overall doesn't hold a candle to the original.",3,5

The Dark Knight Rises is the conclusion of the Dark knight trilogy. I did not Christian Bales Batman. His voice is too human like which is just a personal preference tbh. I don’t like his action scenes. His Bruce Wayne is good tho. The best scenes are when it is Bruce not Batman which is odd because it’s 3 Batman movies and I feel like we only got 1. TDK. This movie is the definition of safe. You may ask well Sean what stuff in this movie have u seen before? To start Bruce Wayne decides he wants to hang up the cowl. Seen that before? Oh idk maybe Spider-Man 2? What about the fact that there is a big bad that has no motives at all and just fights to fight? (Bane) I remember seeing that in 40% of CBM these days but specifically Toad in X-Men 1. There are definitely good things about this movie but it is just all to familiar. The best thing is the stadium scene with Bane. Hold on a second. Scarecrow was never fully used, joker died and Bane just turns out to be a glorified henchman. The treatment of villains is ridiculous. The worst thing about this movie is the handling of the 3 hour runtime. Everything is stretched out so far. This feels nothing like a Nolan movie.

With all-time favorites: Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart, Peter Dinlage, James McAvoy, Ian McKellen, and Michael Fassbender, and so, so, so many more, it would be so easy to be overwhelmed with so many characters and plotlines crossing and threading over each other.

Rotten Tomatoes,Lúcio Leonardo P,X Men Days Of Future Past,"“Mutants bite me”, but I, who expected a “good” film, found it average. Why? Because I thought the story could be more developed for such a complex subject. That the plot could be more elaborate and not give the feeling that it was produced to try to correct past mistakes. And the worst thing is that it doesn't correct it, it just alleviates it and yes, it brings new ones. It's a bit slow, with a script that I didn't really like because it didn't spark greater interest. Don't worry, the film isn't bad. The special effects are spectacular (the scene of the stadium being moved is fantastic), the soundtrack pleases our ears and some characters steal the show, like Mercury, who for me are the best the story has to offer. The problem was the narrative, unfortunately, which may hold our attention, but does not develop at the level it should.",3,5

Rotten Tomatoes,John C,X Men Apocalypse,"I’ve been a fan of the ‘X-Men’ films since they first appeared on our (big) screens way back in 1999.  The first two were great, I didn’t even mind the third that much and the spin-offs were better (in my opinion!) than most people made out.  Naturally, I was sceptical of the franchise’s (soft) reboot with a new – much younger – cast.  However, thanks to JJ Abram’s style of rebooting a franchise, i.e. shove in aspects of time travel and a parallel universe to keep us die-hard fanboys quiet and it sort of worked out, blending old and new cast members alike.  Then came the awkwardly-titled ‘X-Men: Days of Future Past’ and I got completely lost.  That may come from me not seeing its predecessor (‘First Class’) for a while, so I had kind of forgotten who’s who.  However, you would think that any film would need to be reasonably accessible to a new  audience (or someone like me who had just forgotten what had happened before).  Basically, it was a bit all over the place and people who were dead were now alive and people who were alive were now recast.  Unfortunately, the latest ‘X-Men Apocalypse’ movie kind of feels more like ‘Days of Future Past’ than ‘First Class.’

It’s quite a long film and so at least they try to give some of the characters a bit of an introduction.  Even if you – technically – know who these characters are/were, they’ve most likely been recast, so you’ll probably need a refresher on who they are and whether they’re still playing roughly the same role as before.  I guess the new cast are pretty good/relatable, but I’m afraid I’m used to the ‘old lags’ and it’s like watching ‘Muppet Babies’ or ‘Tiny Toons’ only with mutants instead of miniature Kermit the Frog or Bugs Bunny (there’s even a – practically – teenage Striker trying to hunt the mutants down!).  We see our – now young – heroes going about their daily life, getting picked on by that clichéd bully we see in every Hollywood movie with a high school in it and the once fearsome Nightcrawler looks like he’s about to cry most of the time.  It just feels so far removed from the original 1999 ‘X-Men’ movie that this is completely unrecognisable.

Then – as my title suggests – stuff happens.  We’re treated to one scene after the other where someone does something.  That’s my main gripe with it.  The story doesn’t really go anywhere.  Sure, the effects are good and the make-up believable, but it almost comprises on a load of stand-alone sketches that don’t seem to follow on from the one before.  We see the titular (‘first mutant’) ‘Apocalypse’ get released and then start recruiting for his higher-management team by generally making them ‘level up’ quicker than usual and a new haircut for free.  Then we bounce back to the fledgling X-Men and so forth until they have to face off against him.  I may enjoy the X-Men films, but I have to confess that I’ve never read the comics, so I can’t really comment on how authentic Oscar Issac’s look or performance is.  All I know is that he looks pretty unrecognisable as the bad guy and is reasonably cool when it comes to villains and the villainous stuff they generally do, but as far as I understand the real comic book fans felt a little short-changed at his overall role.  

However, it all feels a little samey when you place ‘X-Men Apocalypse’ next to every other recent superhero movie these days (and also some NON superhero movies, too) as Apocalypse’s big plan involves the almost mandatory ‘skybeam’ i.e. the giant computer-generated beam of light coming down and laying waste to a populated area.  Yup, it does seem that that’s every super villain’s masterplan these days.

So, did I hate it?  Well, no.  It’s okay.  Like I say – stuff happens.  And, despite most not really following on from whatever stuff happened right before (and don’t get me started on the whole film not really following on from the rest of the franchise!), some of the stuff that happens is kind of cool.  So, it does have that going for it.  I just think that it’s all a bit of a wasted opportunity when you’re presented with such great characters and none of them ever really feel like they’re allowed to shine.  I didn’t think I wasted my time watching it, but out of all X-Men-related films, I think this is the one I’m least likely to bother watching again.

Oh, and is it just me or is there a weird ‘Mother Theresa cameo’ near the start?",2,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Samuel W,X Men Apocalypse,"A very good take on the Apocalypse storyline that is beloved by X-Men fans everywhere. With newcomer Oscar Isaac introducing himself as the titular villain, he is welcomed as an extraordinary addition and one of the best villains beside Magneto. A story that unravels into a beautiful cacophony of chaos and villains that are interesting and cool, and dynamics that aren’t too forced. Even cameos and old characters don’t feel like they do not belong, making it even more of a natural sequel to a very great movie. As the first “revised” universe movie, it takes a step in the right direction (mostly) without the Wolverine.",4,5

The best thing about the movie is the three sexy girls in the movie, Andree Maranda, Cindy Manion and Jennifer Prichard are very hot.

The truth is that there are people as evil in real life.

The way they trick Melvin was like in Bergman's Hour of the Wolf (1968).

Then there are revenge of all the insults that he didn't avoid at the time.

When he rips off the arm of one of the three thieves it's like in Yojimbo (1961) Sanjuro cuts off the arm of one of three thugs.

Lloyd Kaufman's is a Jewish-American vision of a comic book on film. The film have many sex, violence, drugs, corruption.

When he saves the 12-year-old girl from being prostituted it's like in Taxi Driver.

Rotten Tomatoes,Elvis D,Toxic Avenger,"La productora de serie B Troma Entertainment es conocida en el mundo del bajo presupuesto y The Toxic Avenger es indiscutiblemente la película más icónica de esta productora, llevándola a una fama más grande. Muchas veces se comete el error de catalogar esta película como un producto del cine de terror o el cine gore, a pesar de tener algunos elementos de estos. Esta película es más bien una comedia que parodia el género de superhéroes y nos presenta a un monstruo que toma el rol del héroe cuando en el mundo de los superhéroes rara vez un monstruo es el héroe de la historia. El trabajo es bastante admirable por poseer elementos básicos de una película de explotación que ayudan a que la película sea muy placentera de ver. No es una película con un excelente argumento y las actuaciones claramente son exageradas acorde al humor de la película. The Toxic Avenger se las arregla para ser una película que se puede disfrutar por sus escenas de muerte y el humor que logra ofrecer momentos divertidos.

Rotten Tomatoes,Lou T,Toxic Avenger,"Superman, Batman, and Spiderman are all iconic heroes, that live up to the larger than life mantra. The Toxic Avenger kicks the doors off of that ideal and stomps it into the ground until it's a bloody pulp. Poking fun at film tropes of the 80's, the insane nature of this film makes it downright gross, but also hard to look away from. The action pushes boundaries, while being exciting and fun to watch. The humor is off the rails, but had me thoroughly entertained throughout. With the plot being very basic, the campy and wild feel of the film kept it from folding in with the rest of standard movies. The Toxic Avenger perfectly captures the 80s in a hilariously brutal and shockingly self aware satire of the time, while being full of it's own camp and absurdity.",3,5

The weird hybrid Tokyo San Francisco city is interesting and seems like a cool place if it really existed. Aunt Cass takes care of Hiro and her brother (for some of the movie). Aunt Cass is attractive. Why do they make CG characters so attractive, it's not just me, right? I mean in the Incredible there was literally a scene where Elastigirl stopped to look at and rub her butt. Come on....they know what they're doing.

The voice acting is really good too.Hiro & Baymax are amazingly charming together and the highlight in that department. The supporting cast is really good too but they don't have that much depth but are all likeable, stand out, and well voiced. The villian...is alright I guess. Which ties into the biggest issue for me, the twist is kind of predictable and even when it's explained it doesn't hit that hard but makes sense. It's so obvious it's one of two people the plot makes so obvious like a Scooby-Doo episode. Regardless everything else is so well done it doesn't even matter honestly.

Baymax is adorable and easily steals the show. However, The rest of the characters are fairly unmemorable (not exactly bland, but not exactly enticing either). The tragedy with the brother tugs at your heartstrings, but it's sadly undermined by the twist villain's missed potential where his feelings on all of this go completely out of character just for the sake of evil instead of applying more nuance and humanity to make him more of a misguided figure than true villain given the setup they gave us.

I had no idea so much raw footage of those few weeks existed.",4,5
Rotten Tomatoes, ,Last Days In Vietnam,"I have a very different perspective of this alleged ""documentary"" because, at age 25, I was the Navy Airborne Electronic Warfare Officer who made the assessment and sent the first message calling for the evacuation of Vietnam, Operation Frequent Wind, to begin.

I watched as far into this ridiculous travesty as I could and endured watching and listening to the outright lies of individuals whom I had personally and briefed about the evolving situation.  Because my squadron's direct tasking was to gather intelligence, assess the intelligence and then determine, using a list of defined criteria, at what point the efforts to evacuate should begin my disgust with this propagandistic effluent was and remains palpable.

What it does not tell you is that prior to the evacuation effort the North Vietnamese had been rounding up and arresting government officials, police officers, military officers and the families of those individuals with the intent of placing them in ""reeducation camps.""  Once the North Vietnamese realized that a large-scale evacuation was underway they perceived they were pressed for time and started murdering those targeted people wholesale.  Valid estimates based on gathered intelligence is that they killed as many as 10,000 people.

On my aircraft I had six radios - two UHF, two VHF and two HF, as well as dedicated intercept radios.  I and other members of my aircrew intercepted and heard numerous radio calls in English, French and Vietnamese pleading for help.  By my personal experience several of the calls I intercepted ended in screams and gunfire.

Following the evacuation and my eventual return to my home base on Guam I worked with the Vietnamese refugees there who were awaiting final clearance for transport to the States in Operation New Life.  I had multiple opportunities to verify what I had surmised based on my intercepts of intelligence sources.

Is this still a sensitive topic?  Yes, most definitely.

My squadron still exists and still performs the same intelligence gathering missions worldwide.  However, you will find no mention of the squadron's assignment to or involvement in the evacuation of Vietnam contained in the squadron history online.

On the Wikipedia history of VQ-1, Fleet Air Reconnaissance Squadron ONE, you will find the following which I submitted and inclusion of which VQ-1 opposed:

""In April 1975, two VQ-1 EP-3E aircraft and three aircrews were tasked and deployed to NAS Cubi Point, Philippines, in support of the pending evacuation of Vietnam as part of CTF 72. VQ-1 was assigned the responsibility of providing 24-hour-a-day overlapping coverage in the Vietnam Combat Zone with supporting maintenance, intelligence and operations personnel temporarily located at the VQ-1 Detachment at NAS Cubi Point. Given a specific list of criteria, VQ-1 personnel made the first call to recommend the start of Operation Frequent Wind. Those squadron aircrew members directly involved in the flight operations were recognized as serving in the Vietnam Combat Zone and were eventually awarded a Meritorious Unit Commendation, Humanitarian Action Medal, and Vietnam Service Medal when in 2003 Operation Frequent Wind was reclassified as the 18th and final campaign of the Vietnam War.""

I cannot really blame Rory Kennedy because she depended on sources who knowingly and profusely lied to her to protect themselves and their reputations.  However, I feel completely justified in the half-star rating because the ""documentary"" cannot legitimately be called such based on the fact that the overwhelming amount of the content is false and historically inaccurate.",0.5,5
Rotten Tomatoes, ,Last Days In Vietnam,"There are stories that are best told by those who went through those events, protecting their perspective emotional value from the risk of the cinematic treatment with actors acting out the emotions. That way, stories are passed down and spread to a wider range of listeners finding out about what they had experienced, and reflect on how it can teach and inspire others about the subjected value. This emotionally-affecting documentary unveiled a hidden epilogue to the Vietnam War with harrow and the negative kind of thrill out of apparent hopelessness while hoping for something to turn up, sympathizing with the affected people, both mainly the South Vietnamese and the conflicted soldiers, through the perfect chronicling accounts and archives for the visual and emotional impacts with amazing results.

Rotten Tomatoes, ,Last Days In Vietnam,"In terms of style and presentation, this is a fairly standard documentary told via archive footage and on-camera accounts from witnesses and participants. What makes this documentary worth viewing is the extraordinary story it tells of how the US forces evacuated Saigon during the final days of the Vietnam War. With the city surrounded by communist forces, the civilian population became increasingly panicked and desperate to escape. While the Ford administration tried and failed to secure extra funding from Congress the US Army began covert operations, not even known to the US ambassador, to get people out of the country and to safety. As the political and military situation became more precarious, options for evacuating the thousands of civilian, political and military refugees became increasingly risky. When the situation became hopeless, the US had no option but to start airlifting thousands of people who were taking refuge in the grounds of the embassy to naval vessels waiting offshore. While this was going on, the Vietnamese Navy was leading a ramshackle flotilla of vessels, crammed with people along the Saigon river in order to escape. It is very easy to look back at the events of the Vietnam conflict and cast the USA in a less than favourable light. There's no denying, that terrible things were done in the region by a political and military machine that at times seemed to defy reason. However, this documentary does show that amid this madness, the individual soldiers were trying their best to do the right thing and at times, shows tremendous heroism. The stories of just how far some of the marines, pilots and other military personnel went to try to ensure as many people got out of the country to safety is moving and fascinating. There are accounts of staggering bravery and humanitarianism on the part of both the US and South Vietnamese personnel in what must have been a confusing and dangerous time. The regret that some of them still live with that they were not able to help absolutely everyone and indeed, had to abandon some in their hour of need is painful and very clear to see. This documentary shows that during humanity's darkest times, people can still do good things.",4,5

Rotten Tomatoes, ,Dil-Chahta-Hai,"'Dil Chahta Hai' is a coming of age-comedy-drama revolving around three friends having diverse mentalities towards love and are going through a major transformation in their lives. The importance of having love or a relationship in a person's life and when once found, how it transforms his life in many ways is appropriately shown in Farhan Akhtar's directorial debut 'Dil Chahta Hai'. This movie is relatable to everyone whether you believe in love or not, it will hit you directly in the heart. The emotions of the characters are enhanced by the brilliant performances by all the lead actors and the spectacular music by Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy. It is different from all the romantic movies made in Bollywood. It's realistic, relatable and certainly refreshed the romantic genre in Bollywood. Dil Chahta Hai is highly recommended if you have not seen it yet. No matter how many times you watch this movie the emotions that you will feel while watching it will still remain the same. It can be considered among one of the best movies of all time.",5,5

Rotten Tomatoes,Ash P,The Incredible Hulk,"On the second day, we go into The Incredible Hulk.  Now, why is this tied into the coming Brave New World?  Ross, played by William Hurt, and another character, that's who.  Without spoiling who else is coming, you'd have to see this film to believe who that may be.  Now I will confess, I'm not a big fan of the Incredible Hulk.  I'm a Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde kind of person, but not so much on the hero level of things such as The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen when he was used.  I'm just more of the man versus monster motif more, if you ask me.  Yet it doesn't mean I hate Hulk.  He's just an okay hero.
First of all, almost everyone does agree that this is better than the 2003 Hulk movie.  It had potential, but it also had plenty of problems.  Maybe I'll look into the film and make a review of that if I come around it.  For now, this movie is just as I think of Hulk himself.  Being okay.  The start of it is a good one when you have Bruce Banner, played by Edward Norton just for this film, hiding from the military while exchanging data with a ""Mr. Blue"" until his location was compromised.
I will give this film credit that it balances well with Bruce's humanity with the Hulk's action sequences when it comes to hiding from the military when he continues his research and data exchange.  Even when we see Betty, played by Liv Taylor, getting back together to be the moral support for Bruce.  Meanwhile, one of the soldiers, Emil, played by Tim Roth, had gone through various experiments while feeling more abominable.  If you know, you know.
Nothing more to say on the story as it's okay after the first act of the movie.  I appreciate that it gives more humility with Bruce when he's with Betty while the action holds up well.  Not a drag, I might add.  It's easier said than done that it might be of interest since it's all about Bruce and Betty more than seeing Hulk smash.  Which, when I think back on what I'd said earlier about the Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde motif: This makes a fair bit of sense when it comes to the man and the monster as a way of balance instead of fighting your inner monster.
This is overall an okay popcorn flick if you're in the mood to see a Hulk movie or superhero movies in general.  I'm gonna give this film six and a half Hulk and Betty talking it over on a cliff out of ten.  6.5/10.",3.5,5

Rotten Tomatoes,Camden R,Oppenheimer 2023,Nolan is absolutely incredible With The Story of Oppenheimer!,5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Levi R,Oppenheimer 2023,"Oppenheimer: A Riveting Portrait of Power, Science, and Human Complexity
Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer is a towering achievement in modern cinema, combining history, psychology, and science into a gripping narrative. The film, based on the biography American Prometheus by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin, explores the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the theoretical physicist who led the Manhattan Project. Oppenheimer doesn’t just show a series of historical events; it dives deep into the emotional and ethical struggles of the people behind one of the most world-altering inventions in history: the atomic bomb. Nolan crafts a story that feels as urgent and relevant today as it was in Oppenheimer’s own lifetime, and the complicated relationships at the heart of the film only make the story even more powerful. If I were to rate this movie, I would give it a 4.5 out of 5 stars, and here’s why.
First, the movie’s relevance to today’s world is impossible to ignore. Even though Oppenheimer is set in the 1930s and 1940s, the questions it raises about science, power, and morality still apply. We live in a time where technology—like artificial intelligence, biotechnology, and nuclear weapons—is advancing faster than our ability to regulate it. Watching Oppenheimer and his team wrestle with the implications of unleashing such destructive power feels eerily similar to the conversations happening in politics and science today. The movie doesn’t glorify the invention of the atomic bomb. Instead, it shows how much guilt and internal conflict it created for those involved. Nolan captures the terrifying realization that scientific breakthroughs often come with consequences nobody can fully predict. By showing this, Oppenheimer pushes viewers to think about the responsibility that comes with knowledge—a message that feels more urgent than ever.
Another reason Oppenheimer hits so hard is because of its focus on human relationships. The movie makes it clear that history isn’t just shaped by big ideas and explosions; it’s shaped by deeply flawed people making impossible decisions. Oppenheimer himself, played brilliantly by Cillian Murphy, is portrayed as a man constantly torn between loyalty, ambition, love, and fear. His relationship with Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh) is intense but destructive, revealing his emotional instability. Meanwhile, his marriage to Kitty Oppenheimer (Emily Blunt) shows a different kind of complicated bond, full of resentment, betrayal, and a shared burden. These relationships ground the movie in real human emotion. They remind us that behind every historic moment are people trying—and often failing—to balance their personal lives with the demands of history.
The dynamic between Oppenheimer and General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon) also stands out. Their relationship is not based on friendship but mutual need and begrudging respect. Groves needs Oppenheimer’s mind; Oppenheimer needs Groves’ authority. Watching their uneasy partnership unfold adds another layer to the movie’s tension. Every relationship in Oppenheimer is laced with distrust, longing, or fear, showing how isolation and paranoia can eat away at even the strongest personalities. Nolan doesn’t just give us history; he gives us the loneliness and pressure that history-makers live through, which makes the story feel alive and heartbreaking.
The film’s technical achievements also deserve a lot of credit. From the stunning practical effects that recreate the Trinity Test explosion to Ludwig Göransson’s haunting score, every detail adds to the atmosphere of dread and awe. Nolan famously avoided using CGI for the bomb scenes, and the results are jaw-dropping. The sound design is just as powerful—sometimes cutting out completely to force the audience to sit with the silence of devastation. All these elements make Oppenheimer an intense, almost overwhelming sensory experience that mirrors the emotional storm inside its main character.
As for the performances, Cillian Murphy delivers one of the best portrayals of internal conflict I’ve seen in years. He doesn’t make Oppenheimer a hero or a villain; he makes him human. You can see the weight of his choices eating at him from the inside out. Robert Downey Jr. also gives a phenomenal performance as Lewis Strauss, showing how personal grudges and ambition can twist the course of history. The entire supporting cast is strong, but it’s Murphy who carries the movie, giving it its emotional center.
Now, why not a full 5 stars? While Oppenheimer is an incredible film, it can feel a bit overwhelming, especially in its final act. The non-linear structure—jumping between timelines and perspectives—can be confusing if you’re not paying close attention. Some audience members might find the second half, which focuses heavily on political hearings and betrayals, to drag compared to the intense first half that leads up to the bomb’s creation. While I personally found the political drama fascinating, I can see how it might lose the emotional momentum for some viewers. A slightly tighter edit or a little more focus could have made the film perfect. Still, these are small criticisms compared to how much the movie accomplishes.
In conclusion, Oppenheimer is a masterful film that deserves most of the praise it’s received. It’s relevant because it forces us to think about the cost of progress and the dangers of unchecked ambition. The focus on relationships keeps the story personal, emotional, and painfully real. While it’s not a perfect film, it’s about as close as a historical drama can get.

Rotten Tomatoes,Ted B,Oppenheimer 2023,"4.0 stars; Outside of being the father of the atomic bomb, I didn't really know much about Robert Oppenheimer. This film filled in all the details, maybe a little too much; the three hours started to drag a little until the actual work began in Los Alamos. The rest was the political setup (for and against him) in his achievement of both the physical and emotional accomplishments.

In the acting department, the movie was loaded with heavy hitters. However, Cillian Murphy pretty well stole the show. As I said, I wasn't familiar with th personal side of Oppenheimer, but somehow, Mr. Murphy brought him to life. A tremendous performance.",4,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Ole A,Oppenheimer 2023,"Nothing about who the man really was, and far too little about the Manhatten Project and the genious behind it.

In my opinion, it's the best movie of 2023, and it was the first R-rated piece of cinematic media that I ever consumed. It went for so much, in such a way that I did not expect, and it worked. OMG it worked!

Rotten Tomatoes,Aditya S,Oppenheimer 2023,"It's a gripping historical drama that helps you understand one of the most controversial figures to ever exist. The first half is a bit choppy and can be a bit disengaging since it's not in Nolan's strengths to write emotional arcs well, but the second half is tightly packed and tense, making you feel the emotions and the turmoil of a man that let humans destroy themselves. The practical effects and score are top notch, and you will be left speechless when the Trinity test is shown. Cillian, Emily, Florence and RDJ nail their roles with outstanding performances, and there are genuine moments where you forget these are actors and actually believe what they are saying. If only the first half was written better, it would be a 5 star film.",4,5

I've always enjoyed time travel movies. You travel back, then butterfly-effect the ""present."" But, ""The Call"" takes a different (original) spin on this, by using a telephone to span the 20-years between the (literally) tortured Oh Young-sook of 1999 and the (figuratively) tortured Kim Seo-yeon of 2019. My eager suspension-of-disbelief bought into this concept and its dramatic (horrific?) effects on both the present and the past. Very well done. Lots of wonderful tension. Is Oh Young-sook's shaman mother the villain of the piece? You'll have to stream it and find out....",5,5

Rotten Tomatoes,Deb R,The Call 2020 Kr,"This is probably the best butterfly effect movie made. There are some others I haven't seen but it's kinda like the TV show ""Dark"" but as a movie. It's definitely not for everyone, but I'd recommend this if you like gory stuff and korean TV/film. The cinematography is so beautiful and amazing to look at and the small details are well thought out and well done! Jumpscarewise there isn't much to worry about if you easily get scared, the plot is well done and you'll definitely pay attention and ask questions during the whole thing. I also like how it's unpredictable and that is a mature plus if you really start thinking about the pros and cons about a movie. It was definitely NOT what I was expecting. Also, I really admire that they didn't make the characters dumb. Usually in these types of films they are but not in this one.

Rotten Tomatoes,Jinx H,Tmnt 2007,"WHY DOES THIS MOVIE HAVE SUCH BAD REVIEW </3 Okay, first of all the animation in unique and different, and I'd argue good for it's time. The story is new and fresh, but also has that familiar feeling of the TMNT characters we know and love. The plot is more mature, rather than comedic, which I admit I was apprehensive of at first, yet it worked. The dynamics of Leonardo and Raph felt well represented, better then we've seen in other TMNT movies and shows. I've always found Raphael and Leonardos rivalry to be rushed, out of character, and unneeded, yet this movie does an amazing job at showing how this part of their characters actually makes sense. It's not that Raphael is upset at Leo for being the leader, like in many other versions, it's that he doesn't want to be led. Raph found his own ways to do things with Leo being gone, and he feels unrepresented and controlled now that Leo is back, so it makes sense for him to feel the need to disobey Leo and Splinter. I will say that while I liked the focus on Leo and Raph, I wish Mikey and Donnie had gotten more involved with their conflict, rather then being off to the side and always grouped with each other. It also made no sense for Leo to go after the Nightwatcher, I don't know why that happened. They did Leo a little dirty overall, with Splinter strongly enforcing him as the leader. While Leo is their leader, the turtles are usually indepentent and often do solo missions, so it didn't make sense that they all just had to sit back while he was gone. Back to positive, thought the pacing of this movie was pretty spot on, a hot take. I was involved the whole time, and always knew what was going on. Another positive was Casey and April!!!! AHH I adore them both in this movie. I thought their relationship was cute, and I thought April felt badass, but also caring and genuine. I also loved Casey and Raph's relationship being showcased. Karai also made a decent appearence, which helped keep the authenticity of the TMNT. I thought the Japanese rep could've been more highlighted, but I did like that they gave Karai an accent, that was a nice touch. Overall, this movie isn't talked about enough and does not deserve all this hate.",4.5,5

Casey and April in the movie were awesome! And it was so cool seeing Splinter actually be a fully trained master instead of a lazy rat. I love this iteration of the turtles and always will.",5,5

Rotten Tomatoes, ,Sing 2016,"A conventional product of the mid-2010s-mainstream-PG-animation machine. The timeworn plot device should’ve been avoided or it could’ve worked as a twist had the film had more to latch onto; the latter, which brings me to my next point:  story progression  —  the audition and rehearsal segments are drawn out enough as a gag, with the most effective character development occurring primarily external of the theatre. The voices of the main cast did their part well, but their performances would’ve been amplified and not disposed had their characters been given more investment, which would then enable more possibilities with its plot device.",1.5,5

Rotten Tomatoes,Willian F,Sing 2016,"Sing (Sing - Quem Canta Seus Males Espanta), is an animation that, although it doesn't have the depth of other productions, offers a fun and energetic experience. With interesting characters and an amazing musical selection, the film manages to capture the attention of both children and adults, even though its formula doesn't present any big surprises. The story of a narcissistic koala trying to save his theater with a talent show is simple, but effective. Instead of being a biting critique of reality shows, the film remains light and optimistic, focusing on fun and the power of music. It is a work that, while not likely to be remembered as one of the most memorable, will certainly please during a relaxed family night. In the end, Sing (2016), is a reminder that sometimes a movie is just for relaxing and having fun – and in this regard, it fulfills its role perfectly.",3,5

Rotten Tomatoes,Céleste G,Harry Potter And The Sorcerers Stone,"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's stone is  a 2001  movie of Chris Columbus with Daniel Radcliff in Harry Potter, Emma Watson in Hermione Granger and Rupert Grint in Ronald Weasley .
This movie tells the story of Harry Potter, a boy of 11 years old who learn that he is a wizard and he can go to the wizard's school, Hogwarts. During the folowing year, he makes friends, Hermione and Ron.
I think that the actors play well theirs roles for example at the beginning of the movie when Harry learned that he is a wizard, Daniel Radcliff seems really surprised, stunnded and shocked by this new. Throughout of the year the characters looks filled by the magical world and the actors play very well that emotion.
In this movie, the soundtrack is composed with only instrumental music without sing. The costumes are very important because it permited to the spectator to plunge into the magical universe.
The principal message of Harry Potter is that the friends are an important part of ours  lifes because they are always here to support us.

Pitt's good but really no other character has much depth to them, is memorable beyond the woman soldier, and it really would've helped to have more colorful characters surrounding him. He's interesting enough but defintely needed more. If anything from Dawn of the Dead, The Walking Dead, Zombieland, Shaun of the Dead, and Evil Dead II have taught us anything is that it always pays to have interesting supporting characters to add depth. The zombie designs also are fine but there isn't really anything memorable about them. They're the same generic looking zombie you've seen from I am Legend, Dawn of the Dead remake, Resident Evil, and a ton of others from the past few decades. Same with them being super fast it's nothing we haven't seen before but it's done well. And the special effects are good though them chattering their teeth like the Xenomorph from Alien is kinda goofy. The story is fine and it really is just a bunch of action setpieces where the zombies are in (Insert country name here). That's about it. Save for the first encounter and the last in the WHO lab it's all pretty generic stuff and is a bit repetitive. It's still well told and well made but it's nothing new really. If your a big fan of zombie flicks, any actors in this, or the director than give this a watch for sure.",4,5

Rotten Tomatoes, ,World-War-Z,"I rarely like cgi filled anything, especially zombie movies, but this movie sucks you in from the opening sequence with somewhat believable reaction to how someone might act to protect their family.

Without a doubt, this is the studio's best work yet.",5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Calvin O,Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Mutant Mayhem,"I didn't hate this movie, but aside from the animation style (I'm loving this new trend of blending traditional and CG-- also, I love how no one was designed to be necessarily cute or appealing save for the turtles) this is a pretty generic kids' movie. The story is honestly a bit of a mess (we have two villains, one of which is only there to set up the inevitable sequel, the other only elevated by Ice Cube's entertaining performance and a creepy character design) and the dialogue is so packed with pop culture references that it became tiresome.",3,5
Rotten Tomatoes, ,Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Mutant Mayhem,"Just saw this film and I highly recommend you see this. This adaptation of the Turtles franchise by Nick, Seth Rogen, and the team had made this possible . Being born in 2001 and having the advantage of growing up as a kid with the 4K @wbpictures adaptation & the 2012 @nickelodeon produced re-in carnation. As far as the comics go, my father being around the Marvel, Dark Horse and latter development of more DC Series arcs, it’s no suprise he passed this on to me as a kid & while also being a toddler, I instantly recognized all the characters and would then read the Peter Eastman/Kevin Laird comics as I got older. I was super impressed that this incarnation of TMNT not only had a ton of references to modern life, making it relatable and probably painted the picture of what you’d expect Raph, Leo, Mikey, and Donnie. You could tell that the casting was perfectly fit to the whole premier but the rest of the cast members were true to their characters and playing of lines and delivery.

April O Neil would not only be BIPOC  in this series, (The short lived incarnation 2018 Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle also a Nickelodeon production) would also depict April O’Neil as BlPOC. What stood out compared to the previous incarnations movie and television wise, is that it referenced embarrassment, however also a sense of staying in the fray and subject to what happens around you or rebel and seal your unprecedented circumstances no matter what may occur or what you need to do to seek answers and justify that event . The new arc on Baxter Stockman was thoroughly and probably one of the most exciting things except he was hated and rejected by the world. Most of his arc is normally and intentionally ignored as he is of little help aiding his fellow antagonists into failed attempts to thwart the turtles that are on a much needed mission to prevent harm from the city . 

The final thing I wanted to add on was the soundtrack. This had a blend of much of what you’d hear as far as being a New Yorker.",5,5

Rotten Tomatoes,Kevin P,Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Mutant Mayhem,"A funny, clever reimagining of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles with a fun creative scribble-inspired at style and a cute relatable coming-of-age story about found families and trying to find companionship and acceptance against the odds of ostracization. The voice cast is very solid, albeit a bit widespread too thin, with highlights from Jackie Chan as Splinter, Ice Cube as Superfly, Paul Rudd as Mondo Gecko, and the main 4 actors for the turtles who actually make them sound like young teenagers. My only major complaints are that some aspects of the story feel like brushed over missed potential and occasional misfired humor revolving around grossouts or Gen Z slang. That being said, most of the humor was on-point and the overall story was still very heartfelt and meaningful with some great action and an amusingly messy art style. It’s not a masterpiece, but it’s definitely a breath of fresh air for the Ninja Turtle franchise.",4,5

Rotten Tomatoes,Jannaina M,Spider Man No Way Home,"Spider-Man: No Way Home was an ambitious and emotional film that united different generations of Spider-Man fans. The story brought back familiar characters from previous franchises, which created a strong sense of nostalgia. The performances were powerful, especially Tom Holland's, who showed a more mature and dramatic side of Peter Parker.

However, the film also relied heavily on fan service. At times, the plot felt rushed and overstuffed with too many characters and storylines. Some emotional moments didn’t have enough time to develop, and the motivations of certain villains seemed unclear.

Overall, No Way Home delivered an exciting experience and honored the legacy of Spider-Man, but it also sacrificed some narrative depth in favor of spectacle and nostalgia.",3.5,5

The admittedly entertaining and dramatic flight scenes are ruined by the fact that the climactic mission through a trench at high speed to hit an impossibly small target is practically a frame by frame rip off of Star Wars Episode iV. There may never have been a film less deserving of the praise it has received.,1,5
Rotten Tomatoes, ,Top Gun Maverick,Great movie!!! Saw it twice in theaters,5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Ali L,Top Gun Maverick,"Top Gun: Maverick is the sequel to the original Top Gun movie from the 1980s. It follows Navy Pilot Pete Mitchell, also referred to as “Maverick”, who is still flying jets after all these years. Maverick is called back to train a group of the best young pilots for a dangerous mission. One of those pilots includes Rooster, who is the son of Maverick’s old friend Goose, which creates a lot of emotion and tension in the film. Yes, the story is about flying, but it is also about facing past struggles and fixing relationships. 
I think one of the most amazing things about this movie is how real everything feels. The flying scenes especially feel real, and that is because the actors were actually filmed in real jets, and it’s not just special effects or green screens. Being able to feel the speed and all the danger shows you just how intense it is to be a pilot. Knowing this is how the movie was filmed just makes the movie even more exciting from the beginning. 
The camerawork throughout the film is extremely smooth, even during the flight scenes. This definitely makes it easy to follow, especially when the movie starts picking up speed. The editing in this film, most importantly, how the shots are all put together, is phenomenal. There’s never a point when you feel something is just dragging on and on,  everything is always moving at a perfect pace. Another great strength of this movie is the sound. The music, the sounds of the jet engines roaring, and the quiet still moments right before everything takes off, all pull you deeper into each scene of the film. 
The director, Joseph Kosinski, did an amazing job incorporating both action aspects and deeper emotional moments. This movie actually has heart behind all the action-packed moments, which makes it even better. Maverick has spent years holding onto guilt, and watching him build a relationship with Rooster, who holds a grudge, makes the story even stronger.  
Both the acting and the characters picked for the film were great. Tom Cruise is a great actor for Maverick. While he still holds his confident and rule breaking attitude, you can definitely tell in the movie that he has matured. He’s not trying to prove to everyone he’s the best anymore. He’s trying to help others. The actor who plays Rooster, Miles Teller, also adds to the heart of the film. You can tell he’s hurt, but you can also tell he wants the opportunity to prove himself. The beginning their relationship starts off a little rocky, but as time goes on, you can see the understanding grow between the two of them. To me, watching their relationship unfold was emotional and by far my favorite part of the movie. 
I will say, Maverick’s love interest, Penny, played by Jennifer Connelly, did a good job, but their relationship didn’t seem to play a big part in the movie. The parts focused on the two seemed more rushed and not entirely meaningful to add to the storyline. It gave the feeling that they made the character just to give him a love interest. 
I liked this movie a lot, maybe even more than the original. I do, however, feel like the movie could have been made even better. When you watch the film, you can sort of tell what’s going to happen for the most part, there’s not much that catches you off guard. 
If you haven’t seen the first Top Gun, that is definitely something you should do before watching the sequel. It will give you a better understanding of the relationships and why certain people and parts of the movie mean so much. The movie does give some things away, but without watching the first one, you won’t have the backstory to understand why certain things mean so much.  
The marketing for this movie was done extremely well.  The trailers for the film showed flying scenes and also showed that a lot of Tom’s stunts were done by himself. Once I saw on social media that the actors were being trained in real jets, that completely grabbed my attention. I thought it was impressive to see the real training the actors went through in order to get a real effect in the film. I knew I was going to see this movie before it was even in theaters. 
Top Gun: Maverick truly surprised me. I pictured it to be similar to the first one, but it turned out to have a lot more meaning than I was expecting. Even though some parts of the movie were pretty clear about what was going to happen, and the love story kind of seemed out of place, it was still an excellent movie to watch. Even if you aren’t a strong military or plane-loving enthusiast, it is a very detailed movie. For an overall rating, I would truthfully give this film a 9 out of 10 rating. It was a highly recommended movie to me, and I 100% recommend it to others.",4.5,5

Rotten Tomatoes,Matthew D,Top Gun Maverick,"Tom Cruise delivers Oscar worthy lead acting in a heartfelt sequel to Top Gun.

Director Joseph Kosinski’s war action-drama Top Gun: Maverick (2022) pays tribute to Tony Scott’s Top Gun with stunning cinematography, heartfelt characters, and exhilarating aerial combat. I’d like to think that Tony Scott would be proud of Kosinski for keeping Top Gun character driven. Writers Christopher McQuarrie, Ehren Kruger, Justin Marks, Peter Craig, and Eric Warren Singer nail the mature tone and softer story about aging, grief, forgiveness, comradery, rekindled love, and promises. Top Gun: Maverick’s moving drama is surprising and welcomed alongside thrilling aerial battles with Tom Cruise uplifting the film into soaring new heights.

Kosinski’s direction shoots all these insane aerial dogfights with real Navy jets that are genuinely astonishing to behold. I personally appreciate his character focus to portray how Maverick is still grieving the loss of Goose and guilty over not being able to save his friend. Kosinski has now directed Tron: Legacy, Oblivion, and Top Gun: Maverick that I enjoyed very much, so he continues to be a fascinating director. His sincere approach to drama and then striking visuals for action feels smooth and effortless. Top Gun: Maverick is something special.

Eddie Hamilton’s editing is slick with these cool transitions from talking to flying. The plane sequences are cut with an easy to follow continuity that’s easier to read than even the first Top Gun. I found cinematographer Claudio Miranda’s wide shots in the sky truly breathtaking. There’s nothing more impressive visually than the camera right on the plane or looking out the jet window out at the Sun. All the close-ups during Maverick’s conversation with Iceman actually got me crying.

Tom Cruise is phenomenal and subtle in a wonderfully understated dramatic return as Top Gun pilot Maverick. He’s engaging and concerned for his fellow pilots as Cruise ensures you know how worried and conflicted Maverick now feels. He’s an old hero aging out of the flight programs in the Navy and Maverick feels he has to help these young pilots return home safely out of reverence for his lost friend Goose from Top Gun. Cruise will get tears out of you in a tender and sophisticated acting performance from Cruise in the middle of an action movie. His heartfelt scene doubting himself with Val Kilmer’s bittersweet return as Iceman is very touching. Tom Cruise can still do incredible dramatic work as an actor, not just a triumphant action star.

Jennifer Connelly is fantastic and moving as Penny Benjamin in a cute rekindled love interest and appreciated age appropriate relationship for Tom Cruise’s Maverick. She feels forward and mature with a playful liveliness. I like how she is there to encourage Maverick, while demanding he really love her and be himself again. She’s a steadfast lover and a wonderful choice for Maverick’s new flame. Lyliana Wray is nice and serious as Penny’s protective daughter Amelia Benjamin. I loved her line directly telling Maverick not to break her mother’s heart ever again. I like to think she’s really his daughter from back then, even though that’s not in the script.

Miles Teller is stern and frustrated as the angry Rooster. He holds his own against a forlorn and guilty Tom Cruise when Rooster and Maverick are arguing about his continued desire to fly dangerously. I think he does a respectable job as Goose’s son.

Jon Hamm’s stern and condescending Vice Admiral Cyclone is interesting as he wants obedience from Maverick and success even at the potential cost of Naval pilots’ lives. Glen Powell steals all his scenes as a charismatic and arrogant pilot named Hangman because he leaves his team out to hang at the sign of trouble. Lewis Pullman looks just like his dad Bill Pullman as the nerdy and quiet Bob, who is very honest and steadfast.

Ed Harris cameos as the blunt and furious Rear Admiral Hammer. Monica Barbaro is pretty and confident as Phoenix in a nice supporting role for her. Charles Parnell is quite touching as Warlock, especially in his supportive and knowing moments with Tom Cruise’s Maverick. Jay Ellis’ Payback, Danny Ramirez’ Fanboy, Greg Tarzan Davis’ Coyote, and Bashir Salahuddin’s Hondo all get their moments. Hans Zimmer and Harold Faltermeyer’s score are massive and powerful like Lady Gaga’s wonderful soundtrack single for Top Gun: Maverick.

In all, Top Gun: Maverick is worth seeing for sure. Tom Cruise’s magnetic performance is thoughtful and moving, while Kosinski’s fighter plane dogfights are unreal to witness.",5,5

Rotten Tomatoes,Red  T,Hes Just Not That Into You,"This actually could've been a decent RomCom if it just trimmed down on the ensemble cast and tighten the narrative a bit more. The biggest flaw is the terrible editing. This jumps around CONSTANTLY with different subplots that feel more like a compilation especially in the first half than a characters who share the same story. None of the stories really compliment each other and just kind of show the cliches of relationships. They never feel like though they add to a central theme. The transitions with the random people commenting on their relationships should've been cut. I honestly didn't know that they all knew each other until midway because it's so jumpy and unfocused. It does get significantly better in the second half when it focuses just on the Main girl and Connolly. Everything else is just ok about this. Cooper has no real chemistry with anyone, Most of the side characters don't have much depth to them. Surprisingly the best things in this are Long and Connelly who are half decent surprisingly. This also alternates between subpar dialogue that acknowledges the cliches it's doing and giving witty lines out of no where. Also none of the settings are really memorable or shot in a way that makes them memorable. Honestly if characters like Aniston/Affleck, Barrymore, and the random Segway interviews would've been cut and spent more time seeing the remaining characters develop in a shared setting more than just exchanging banter in the office for a minute here and there and a tighter script this could've been good. Unless your a big fan of Long or Connelly, I can't really recommend this to anyone. There are much better RomComs and better stuff these actors have all done.",3,5

Rotten Tomatoes,Mike P,Insidious,"Way under-rated haunted house/possession story..which is an update of Poltergeist; and I think it's brilliant!...It follows the saga of the Lamberts; (Rose Byrne and Patrick Wilson); a yuppie couple that moves into a new house in Los Angeles; but then quickly their son Dalton slips into a coma ...And pretty soon they realize that somehow his spirit has wandered off to Hell, and is stuck there; and now the father has to go save him.  And Insidious is bitingly terrifying, where Poltergeist pulls it's punches and is overly cautious and safe in its presentation.... And actually Insidious winds up giving us some of the scariest scenes ever filmed. It's a horror masterpiece.",5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,K K,Insidious,"""Malignant evil"" v ""Family""

OK, this is a fantastic scary movie, but really, it is a dark drama with scary moments that scare us due to being engrossed in the story.

There is a fuller set of actors and each brings a unique character. It is fun with chance to get connected to one or more character(s) or at least wonder who is getting it, how and when. Horror enjoyment can be the kills. AHS, the TV show, reflects the beauty of a full cast of characters that contribute to the important concept of horror movies not sure where, when and how some die or stay alive. This approach enhances the overall suspense while story being told.

The family felt genuine, so I felt like I was a part of real life. Yeah sure this movie had horror fantasy aspect of the evils going on. Yet each scene they took was authentic with the characters, story, script and the other good stuff in movies: sound, camera, director, sets, costumes. This was a real family going through challenges with Malignant, (I probably should leave that movie alone) evil things. 

I do not want to spoil things as some may not have seen this movie even though it has been out for a good 15 or so years!

Yet I find this setting, family, struggling with something is a storyline USED WAY Too MUCH in recent movies by one of the people involved in productions, especially in 2024 released movies via attempting to keep remaking movies like Insidious.

That is what is so compelling about Insidious. It creates THE FURTHER. It is Insidious and cannot be copied. The stage version of Insidious and trying to incorporate The Further, shows as much. Another comparison is to say, in sports with tennis, Nadal, or Evert with very distinctive great games, tons of people came along trying to manufacture their style of play, and they couldn't, as they are unique, and the people trying to manufacture clones of Nadal and Evert lost site of a key principal to what makes things great, being unique, create own thing!

There are many movies on the market about this subject, but so many I find stupid and with little semblance of reality. Sure, some are pure escapism, but more often than not silly and have no substance.

This movie is anything but lacking substance and the opposite of silly due largely to the acting, script and direction. The acting is fantastic whether the actors are alone or in scenes together!",5,5

Rotten Tomatoes,Zy S,Insidious,"One of the better paranormal horror movies out there.  The movie did a good job in establishing the rules and limitations of the demonic entities as well as give solid structure to plot development... which is an area most of these type of movies seem to lack and just make things up as the movie progresses.  Consistency was also top notch for a film like this.  I think that the director could have done a little better job at making the demons more restricted in their abilities to justify why it took them so long to abduct the souls of their victims (or swap with them?).  Overall, I think this movie is a solid case study for how paranormal horror movies should be structured, because you need concrete rules and limitations for demons explained in the movie and consistency with said rules so that the audience can follow along and actually appreciate plot twists or unfolding events.",4,5
Rotten Tomatoes,alexander m,Insidious,"James Wan solidifies himself as a directorial master with insidious, a take on the overdone haunted house/possession movie that goes in a new and interesting direction.

Rotten Tomatoes,Josh A,Insidious,"Once again, James Wan proves himself to be an absolute legend, for this is just a brilliant movie and a great start to the series.

Firstly, the movie's plot sort of reminds me of Coraline and feels Neil Gaiman-esque. Mostly the stuff in the Further, which is my favourite part of the film. It's like Coraline meets Stranger Things. Also, the demon looks like a rip-off Darth Maul, but is absolutely amazing as a villain. The reveal with him in the room playing Tiptoe Through the Tulips is brilliant.

The characters are also amazing. They all feel like real people and not just characters to drive the story forward. This makes the ending more dramatic and brilliant, as you can see the differences in Josh's personality when he's possessed. It's just a brilliant ""To Be Continued"" ending and a great first part to the Lambert trilogy.

Overall, great movie.",5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Hugh J,Insidious,"Insidious makes valiant attempts to place jump scares where they are not expected leading to a couple of good frights, but also implements a few very predictable ones. Despite a familiar storyline and the ""evil presence"" looking like a hipster demon from a broadway musical, there is enough consistant fear that contributes to it being an overall decent horror movie.",3.5,5

Rotten Tomatoes,Benjamin J,Insidious,One of the jumpscares nearly caused me to go to the hospital.,4.5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Rami A,Insidious,"Horror films often have two major issues: the foolish behavior of the protagonists and the presence of easily solvable problems. These elements can make the film feel like a complete waste of time. I'm not saying that the movie is bad; it just needed a lot more development. There wasn't anything truly scary about it, as the situation could have been resolved in a matter of seconds. For instance, simply leaving the child at the hospital would have been an easy solution. 

Tthe lack of character depth can detract from the overall experience. When protagonists act irrationally, it’s hard for viewers to connect with them or feel any real tension. The suspense hinges on relatable characters making difficult decisions, yet too often, we see characters making choices that feel contrived or unrealistic. 

Building a solid atmosphere is crucial in horror storytelling. A genuinely eerie setting combined with nuanced characters can elevate a film, creating sustained tension and unease. Unfortunately, many recent horror films overlook these elements in favor of jump scares or cheap thrills. A well-crafted narrative with intelligent, relatable characters can leave a lasting impression, while an easily resolvable plot does the opposite. Ultimately, horror films should engage viewers on multiple levels, provoking thought and eliciting genuine fear rather than frustration.",3,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Michael B,Insidious,"Like an unorganized pile of cliches.  The horror here is the idea that someone paid for this movie to be made.  I’ve seen scarier episodes of Sesame Street, better written ones too.

The good-
1. Some well done jump scares throughout the movie

The Bad- 
1. The basic storyline is a retread of what has been done numerous times in different ways.
2. Even though it runs a short 1 hour and 43 mins it seems to drag because of the terrible pacing. Frankly it becomes a different movie each act. 
3. The acting has a lot to be desired. Especially, Patrick Wilson who is super stiff (i am usually big fan of his work)and the rest of the cast seems like they are doing an haunted house reenactment on TLC",2.5,5

Rotten Tomatoes,Justin T,Smile 2022,"I didn’t know what to expect from this, I had only seen the poster and knew nothing of the content. The setup of the story is excellent. What also struck me right from the start was that the cinematography was over-engineered, it looked robotic and too clean and there was an ugly vignette for much of the film. The acting is mostly excellent, sometimes a little too drama school from the younger cast members. I disagree with some of the casting, Judy Reyes feels like she should be in a comedy, Jessie T. Usher needs an injection of personality and Kal Penn’s role should have been given to anyone else - I can’t think of a worse miscast. Since I’m focussing on the negative then I’ll add that it feels heavily inspired by It Follows (2014). I didn’t like the demon voice from the therapist, her normal voice would have been creepier. There was no need for some of the shots to be upside down. Finally for the negatives I occasionally found it formulaic and predictable like after a shocking event cutting ahead in time and skipping the aftermath. Overall though most of this is easy to ignore and you get a consistently engaging, creepy and really quite shocking film with a really unsettling vibe. It’s very gory in a good way. Also it gets a bonus point for some great jump scares and eerie ambience. There are so many good set-pieces in this film.",3.5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Douglas H,Smile 2022,"Definitely creepy with some good jump scares.  You really get to see the monster inside at the end!  It would be interesting if they explored the origin of the evil, but definitely worth watching with the lights low.",4,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Rob W,Smile 2022,"'It Follows' a trend of surreal horror with a dreamlike feel. However, aside from good production value I honestly didn't enjoy the film. I thought the scariest part of the film was the one jumpscare I didn't see coming somewhere in the second quarter. The plot was an amalgam of 'The Ring' and 'It Follows' but was mostly entirely predictable with flimsy characters who I thought poorly fleshed out and rarely engaging. The attempt at dealing with mental health as a theme also felt very uncomfortable, and not in an atmospheric way that added to the film, but in a way that felt entirely disrespectful to the subject matter; used as a plot device to further a struggling story that ended exactly as you would expect. The use of 'And it was all a dream' not just once, but several times throughout the movie was cheap and not what I expected from a film that was reviewed so well. Also, the blatant attempt to set up a quick sequel film at the end was just disappointing. At least try to make a standalone film that doesn't clearly just want to pander to something topical half heartedly. Honestly, lads: do better.

I would recommend as a hate watch, but realistically if you want something that deals with mental health well and in a horror genre, watch The Babadook and if you want something surreal and dreamlike that actually works, 'It Follows'. This belongs in a scrap heap.",1,5

It's only for a very short period of time that we found out that Smile actually stars Kevin Bacon's daughter, and if that's not enough for you then feel free to comment on my review if you have or have not heard about it. I personally don't mind. But anyways, let's begin. Smile is the most anticipated horror film from this decade it managed to get the audience's expectations who wanted to p***ed their pants scared. Therapist Rose Cotter meets graduate student Laura Weaver, who explains that she recently witnessed her professor killing himself. She claims to be terrorized by an invisible Entity that only she can see that appears as various smiling people and has foretold her death. She begins screaming and choking, prompting Rose to call for help; Laura suddenly calms down and smiles uncannily, then fatally slits her own throat with the shape of a smile. The next day, Rose sees a patient named Carl, who yesterday mumbles about everybody including himself is going to die, who smiles in the same way and tells her that she is going to die. Rose calls for nurses to restrain Carl, only to realize Carl has been asleep the entire time. She now she begins to have the same entities that her previous patient had leaving her going mental and crazy. With many recent horror films that are graphic, this one had me on the edge. With many horror films I've seen in recent years, this one I liked but there's one thing that I'm disappointed about is the ending. I mean, yeah, you all know what's going on in it if you haven't or have seen it, is the ending I did not expect but aside from that, I'm quite disappointed with it, which leads up to the sequel which I haven't that came out last year. Before I heard about the sequel, I'm impressed with the ending but now after I heard about it, I will be sure to get over it. The sequel which I've heard had outdone the first Smile making it a much better film but I heard it's gonna be gory so looks like I'm gonna get into the gory experience on the sequel. There's something about one scene that me at my eye presence when the entity pretending to be a therapist and she gets her and looks at her dribbling. What am I even looking at? That is creepy but this is something that a xenomorph would do. With Smile, I personally liked horror aspects that can make you jump. I personally can do the same thing to my family mostly making a very creepy face because I'm a creepy guy. Hahaha! Get ready for a horrifying experience again and the sequel with a smile on your face. Cheese!",3.5,5

Rotten Tomatoes,Rosana B,Paper Towns,"Um filme de comédia romântica-drama adolescente delicioso, que nos remete a adolescência, com nossos questionamentos, dúvidas e temores, a química dos personagens nos leva a imersão, no clima que vislumbra o mistério, comédia salpicada, flerta com o romance. Trilha sonora deliciosa, melancólico e quase sombria.
""Talvez nem todos ganhem loteira, mas isso não significa que não pode ter aventuras incríveis e conhecer pessoas extraordinárias, e criar memorias indeléveis, o segredo é perceber isso""",4,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Allan C,Paper Towns,"Introverted high school senior Quentin, who has been in love with his cute neighbor, Margo, for years, is unexpectedly taken on a night of wild adventure with his lifelong crush, who then mysteriously disappears the next day. Q follows clues left behind by Margo with his friends as to Margo's possible whereabouts, leading to a road trip and new friendships and relationships. It's a likable teen comedy/drama about young folks discovering themselves, where it's about the journey and not the destination. However, PAPER TOWNS is not as funny or as touching as it thinks it is. Cara Delevingne steals the film as the unpredictable wild child Margo. Although she does not have as much screen time as the other characters, she lives up to her character's larger-than-life persona, and you cannot deny Delevingne's star power. Looking at her filmography, I'm kind of disappointed she hasn't gone on to do anything that is all that notable. She's been in some big films, like the first SUICIDE SQUAD (the bad one and not the good one) and Luc Besson's disappointing VALERIAN, but nothing else of note. With the right project, she should be a star. Halston Sage also makes an impression as Margo's best friend who tags along on the road trip, but the other kids on the road trip never rise above teen movie stereotypes. Although PAPER TOWNS has its moments, it's a far cry compared to the far superior coming-of-age films, such as PERKS OF BEING A WALLFLOWER or SING STREET, which you should immediately watch if you haven't seen either.",2.5,5

Rotten Tomatoes,Ola  G,Paper Towns,"Quentin ""Q"" Jacobsen (Nat Wolff) lives across the street from Margo Roth Spiegelman in Jefferson Park, a subdivision of Orlando, Florida. She is a childhood friend from whom he has drifted over nine years after they discovered the corpse of a local lawyer, Robert Joyner, who killed himself after his divorce. Unbeknownst to Margo, Quentin has been infatuated with her since they became neighbors. After reaching adolescence, Margo (Cara Delevingne) becomes one of the popular girls, with an adventurous reputation, at Jefferson Park High School.[a] In contrast, Quentin is kind, unassertive, and unpopular. His friends are fellow outcasts Benjamin ""Ben"" Starling and Marcus ""Radar"" Lincoln. One night, Margo climbs through Quentin's window and recruits him for an all-night, revenge adventure. She has discovered that her boyfriend, Jason ""Jase"" Worthington, is having sex with one of her friends, Rebecca ""Becca"" Arrington. After buying supplies, Margo and Quentin pull humiliating pranks on Jason, Rebecca, and their friends, including Margo's best friend, Lacey Pemberton. Margo believes Lacey knew about but did not tell her about the infidelity. However, it is later revealed that Lacey was unaware until she was pranked. The event gives Quentin hope that he finally has a chance to develop a closer relationship with Margo. He begins to learn how to assert himself and to take chances.
The next day Margo does not come to school and, after a few days, some consider her missing, while others conclude she left for an undisclosed location...

""Paper Towns"" received mixed reviews from film critics. Rotten Tomatoes critical consensus reads, ""Paper Towns isn't as deep or moving as it wants to be, yet it's still earnest, well-acted, and thoughtful enough to earn a place in the hearts of teen filmgoers of all ages."" 

""Paper Towns"" is a bit wishy washy to my mind, trying to blend a coming of age setup with some sort of ""mystery"" structure with high school as a backdrop. The film doesn't really know what it wants to be. There's no real highs and no real lows in it. It's more of a flatlining movie that plays infront of you. Nat Wolff is somewhat colourless, while  Cara Delevingne does have something and her piercing eyes are just lovely. But, I reckon the script (based on the book with the same name) doesn't reach a satisfying result if you ask me, despite ok performances and an ok production.",3,5

Rotten Tomatoes,Isaac V,Paper Towns,"When I read the book, I was totally in awe of the characters, each one of them was amazing (in their own way), and even the secondary characters were very familiar, you could feel them important within the story.
  After finishing the book I went to see the movie and was very disappointed. The flattest characters I've ever seen in a movie, devoid of emotions. And boy did they remove several important parts of the development of the characters themselves.
You never see a great relationship between them in the film, a strange atmosphere is created where at no time do you believe that they are friends, everything happens so fast and without explanation that it loses all the magic of the book itself.
That they removed the moment where they raided SeaWorld, it takes a lot out of the character of Q and Margo. And the ending, oh my god, the ending is horrible, where was the magic of the ending, the whole journey, just disappointing.
If you haven't read the book or know something about it, I think you'll be able to enjoy it while eating your dinner or just to hang out, but if you've already read the book, please don't make the same mistake as me and don't watch it, it's not worth it",0.5,5

Rotten Tomatoes,leonia d,To All The Boys Ive Loved Before,"To All the Boys I've Loved Before is a rom-com that has been hugely successful and watched by many teenagers all over the world. I watched it when I was fifteen years old and, sometimes, I still watch it in my free time. 

The plot and the mood of the movie is extremely sweet and romantic. The acting from the principal actors is really touching. When you watch the movie, you will feel happy, sad, betrayed and romantic. 

The feeling that the characters have will be felt by you too. If I can talk about my favorite character, it is Kitty, the little sister. She's really funny and maybe, somewhat overconfident. However, without her, Lara-Jean would not have been with her lover, so I think Kitty has an important place on the movie.

In fact, I really see myself in Lara Jean or my mother in Margot. It might bother some watchers, but I liked the fact that it is easy to realize the movie is a book adaptation by how much time characters spend just talking. Most book adaptations cut off the considerly boring part of converstation and leave just the action, which most of the time kills the whole plot and point of the story. As someone who usually watches only 2000s

Rotten Tomatoes,Fer S,1017776-Rocky,"I rarely consider a movie a Must-See. This one deserves it all!!
Just great.",5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Jay W,1017776-Rocky,"All-time great films can typically fall into one of two categories: those that pioneer and those that perfect. For example, ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" (1937) pioneered animated films, but ""Beauty and the Beast"" (1991) perfected that formula. ""Rocky"" (1976) does both. It was a pioneer for the sports movie while at the same time perfecting that genre.

Stallone's struggles of getting the movie made perfectly parallel the journey Rocky goes through in the film. Stallone was a man that had to live in his car, sell his dog and put everything on the line to get this film made. And through his struggles, the film was the highest grossing film that year, and walked away with 3 Oscars including ""Best Picture"". The underdog movie written by some bum from the neighborhood, had gone the distance and K. O'd the champ. You can feel the grit and passion in every frame of this movie. There is a genuine love to this film that can't be reproduced by any cynical corporate executive.

Along with being a standout in sports movies and low budget films, the movie is also a technical achievement. This film incorporates the training montage. The technique that movies from this time forward would countlessly spoof and duplicate, this is the one that started it all. Along with the montage, the techniques of moving the camera through tight corridors and upstairs was revolutionary for the time. Typically, film dollies were too bulky to make those kinds of moves, but ""Rocky"" changed that.

OK, now outside all the technical side elements of this movie, how is the movie itself? It is a masterpiece. The story is fairly simple. Heavyweight boxing champ, Apollo Creed gives a local underdog boxer an opportunity to fight for the Championship of the World. (This was 1976, so the championship belt was seen as the greatest title in the known world. Boxing was a really big deal back then.) Apollo Creed, of course, picks our hero: Rocky Balboa, as his challenger for the New Year's fight. Rocky trains the next five weeks to do the fight of his life.

What this movie, and the whole series understands is the film is not about boxing, it is about the characters. I have actually heard people debate on whether this film counts as a ""Sports Movie"", that is how much the film focuses on its characters. I will emphasize, THE CHARACTERS are what makes this story work. Stallone as Rocky Balboa is an absolutely transformative performance. As the trailer announcer says, ""When you see Stallone, you will only see: Rocky Balboa"". He plays the line of being both likable to always root for, but relatable enough to feel real. Talia Shire as Adrian is wonderful. Burt Young as Paulie, Burgess Meredith as Mickey and Carl Weathers as Apollo are all absolutely golden in their roles. The same can be said with any of the minor characters as well. It can be tricky in under 2 hours to introduce and handle so many memorable characters, but ""Rocky"" absolutely pulls it off. Never do I feel like I am watching actors read from a script, I am just seeing characters talk, I am always 100% sucked into their world.

Speaking of, this movie creates a city and community that feels real. It may lack some of the polish of other movies, but that dirt and grime is what helps this world feel real. The movie feels so real that I meet people to this day that think that ""Rocky Balboa"" is a real heavyweight champion. Yes, I am aware that Stallone based the story off of Chuck Wagner, the workout from Joe Frazier, Apollo from Muhammad Ali and his hero from Rocky Marciano. But art imitates life, and throughout history, we see life imitate art.

Truth be told, this film has played such a large part of my life, I felt intimidated even writing a review for it. As if I didn't feel capable to put into words why it is I love this movie as much as I do. I don't think I can fully do justice to the film. Suffice it to say, just watch the movie.",5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,William C,1017776-Rocky,Greatest movie of all time. A lot of that has to do with the perfect combination of the story line and the music.

Rotten Tomatoes,Jay W,Rocky Iv,"Merry Christmas and Happy Boxing Day:

Some might call this one a guilty pleasure, but I can't help but LOVE this movie. This was the first Rocky Movie I saw, and it instantly became one of my favorite movies. Even after watching all the films, this was still my childhood favorite. I enjoy the fact that this film has taken on a life of its own. Even if people haven't seen a Rocky movie, they will still cite, ""the one where he fights the Russian"". It has become a staple of 80's pop culture; in fact, it was named by Patrick Williems as the ""Most 80's Movie ever made"". It is the only one that Stallone went back to and made its own director's cut of the film. It remains the highest grossing entry of the entire franchise.

And yes, my brain knows that on paper, there is not much to this movie. When people dismiss the Rocky Franchise as ""just a boxing movie"" this might be the film they're referring to. Most of the film entries of the Rocky Franchise are dramas about characters who happen to box. Rocky IV is an action movie. But instead of guns and explosions, it is all a set up for the big boxing match.

The movie's story is insultingly simple. There is a big bad guy that Rocky must go beat up. But in order to beat him up he is going to have to get stronger. In the other films there would also be some emotional obstacle he would have to overcome in order to train at his best. Not this one, this one he just has to work out. And work out he does. The movie is no joke, 15% training montage. With a sharp 90 minutes runtime it is the best workout movie anyone could ask for. Helping with that reputation is some of the greatest training music of all time. Find this soundtrack and put it on your playlist. You will be running faster and jumping higher.

And let's not forget, this was the fight that ended the Cold War, so it has great historical significance. It may be just a work out movie, but that works out well for the movie.",5,5

I took private lessons from my Dad's friend Jerry across street from my house 🏡. he said I heard you getting messed with so I could reach you guitar cause you love Elvis Presley music or teach u Karate Tae Kwon Do . you could smash em with guitar 🎸 or learn to protect yourself from bullies just in case you don't have guitar with you lol . so I took lessons mon wed Friday . it worked I beat her guy who was messing with me even defending myself against my cousin who also took Karate for years had trophies too. anyway went saw movie loved how Daniel and Mr Miyagi were teacher student but also became great friends . learned a lot of Karate and also morals from that movie and the others after that . just wish Noriyuki Pat Morita could've lived to be in Cobra kai also . it lacked his gifts that they forgot to stick to that made those movies great.  I've watched the movies so many times I knew it word for word . and the lessons worked also . it will always be my favorite of movies I love and great memories I have cause of it,5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,SkyRo P,Karate Kid,"The 1984 film ""The Karate Kid,"" featuring Ralph Macchio and Pat Morita, is an absolutely remarkable and outstanding cinematic experience. My admiration for this franchise has deepened tremendously, thanks to this film and the subsequent installments that have expanded its legacy. This movie is truly one-of-a-kind. Mr. Miyagi stands out as one of the most iconic characters in film history, while Daniel LaRusso shines as a true cinematic treasure.

The fight sequences are absolutely thrilling. The marketing was spot on, ensuring that all action scenes were dynamic and engaging, steering clear of the typical CGI pitfalls and uninspired performances. Instead, it delivered an exhilarating showdown that was unexpected for an '80s film.

Cobra Kai is portrayed as a ruthless and aggressive organization, led by the menacing instructor played by Martin Kove, who has maintained this legacy of intimidation and villainy for years—it's fascinating to witness.

William Zabka evolves into a character of great significance, one that continues to resonate in popular culture, showcasing a multifaceted portrayal of a once-villainous figure whose journey takes intriguing turns. This story is a continuation of a saga that builds upon itself, culminating in a television series and additional films that flesh out this character in ways that are both surprising and captivating.

This film is nothing short of extraordinary, and I cherish every moment of it. It truly deserves its status as a classic.",5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,matthias s,Karate Kid,"*The Karate Kid* is one of those timeless classics that hits harder the older you get. Watching it as a kid, I was inspired to take karate lessons to stand up to bullies, and now, as an adult, I totally get why this movie has such an enduring legacy. Mr. Miyagi, the ultimate father figure, is so much more than just a karate sensei—his wisdom, humor, and tragic backstory make him a character for the ages. The way he teaches Daniel isn’t just about karate; it’s about life. ""Wax on, wax off"" might sound silly, but it’s a genius way to teach focus and patience. The dialogues are full of life lessons, and honestly, almost every line is quotable. The third act? Perfection. It all leads to that final showdown, which still gives me chills. After revisiting this, I can't wait to dive into Part II. This movie absolutely stands the test of time.",4,5

The Karate Kid is obviously a little aged now in terms of its relatability to present day, but, its so much fun. Its one of those underdog stories which makes you believe that its possible to become a Karate expert overnight. In your mind, you too can become a karate legend by just doing chores and activities around the home. The training sequences are iconic, and the fights (though a little artificial) are fun! Pat Morita is a legend, and always will be! Ralph Macchio is a legend too (even though his performance in hindsight is a little shaky).

Rotten Tomatoes,Kyle M,Star Wars Episode Iii Revenge Of The Sith,"If ever a film you have seen is coming to the theaters and you feel slightly compelled, that will grow once you decided to see it as intended. Apparently for most films nowadays they are being first watched on smaller screens, rather than the platform that originated in the art form since the presented projection. The form consists of storytelling deliverances with thematic and performative impacts whilst presenting expressive momentum from different production merits attributing to heighten the collective effect instilled by the film. In arguable contrary, there is a more defining first impression awaits as a more rightful experience that truly marks the film for what it is, per scope’s requirement or potential crowd-pleaser.

While my first introduction to Star Wars was for a while through “The Clone Wars” with little gist of the lore, formally leaning towards the main films was preferably chronological, starting with the prequel trilogy. There was only little appreciation to the cumulative efforts beneath the enjoyment without critical realization such as how much of a classic the original trilogy is while the prequels practically pale in comparison, until decidedly seeing “Revenge of the Sith” on the big screen recently. When watching Episode III’s direct predecessors, they are mere practice in response to innovative technology with little focus in solidifying the narrative buildup, resulting in constant problematic executions as well both being dimensionally flat. The climatic finale was initially seen decent at best with its darker evolution sank the defining chapter as the least. However, upon re-evaluating those films in anticipation of III’s re-release in coinciding with its 20th anniversary, the film not only rose in ranking but retrospectively improves to realize it is truly one of the franchise’s best, solely for its unexpectedly profound operatic sensation, which frankly not quite dimensional elsewhere in validating the categorization when the Force was really strong in this one.

From an innocent, gifted child upon introduction to loyal but hormonal student mastering the Jedi way, there is slight dread in watching Anakin’s journey through the prequel trilogy’s first two chapters, knowing his mechanical fate. This film’s narrative position reminds us that this is where his dark downfall begins, yet the film attempts to reset that knowledge with hope of prevented destiny only lingering as misleading and make it all more tragic. Series creator George Lucas, who previously directed and written “Star Wars” (“A New Hope”), somehow could not deliver that stellar deftness for the prequels due to the unbalanced focus when writing solely around innovative visuals rather than solidifying a narrative foundation like before. This film, however, came to his defense without saving the first two prequels as this story is his true aim after struggling in bringing balance to the Force regarding the young Skywalker’s journey eventually becoming Darth Vader. Most of the noteworthy flaws, as considerable essences, have improved to validate the operatic dimension when involving awaiting destinies that inevitably transitions onto the classic for sake of consistency.

Trekking through a more polished spectacle that makes the troubled worldbuilding worth the progress is the performances finally showing executive acceptance to comfortably weigh those lines, to the evocative emotionally resonating extent of utter conviction. Ian McDiarmid refines his nuanced continuous portrayal of Palpatine/Darth Sidious with a more fleshed out psychological storyline and justifying the transformative threat with glee. Both Samuel L. Jackson and Natalie Portman as Mace Windu and Padme Amidala are also narratively strengthened amid the story’s impending bleak times through sharp ethics and getting overwhelmed emotionally (easily, even when characteristically pregnant), respectively, while the latter builds her character’s chemistry with genuineness. Frank Oz edges his iconic voice as Yoda with attempted grit in confronting the growing threat, thus evolving his character from puppetry constraints to a skillfully action-packed, expressively instinctual role. Finally, much like the iconic lightsaber battle of two brothers, two longtime friends, a teacher and his padawan, both Hayden Christensen and Ewan McGregor piercingly perfected their roles that they were cast for from the beginning. They have transcended the required emotions for palpable tangibility to the level that both solely risen the operatic impression with stunning effect in their nuanced deliverances, especially Christensen greatly improving his participation.

The stunning visuals – putting it mildly – and the gradually mustered powerhouses may have achieved the notable height that verifies the franchise’s epic space opera core when not adventurous nor riveting, what ultimately powers them is John Williams also amping his part. As a constant composer through the Skywalker Saga, he started becoming a welcoming trait that continues on from coming off impressive in the classics, celebrative in the sequels and sensual in the prequels, until he really took his score to the next heightened level that puts us in an astonishing grip over what he conjured in comparison to his iconic pieces. This debatably borderlines theatrical exclusivity when merely amazes elsewhere but not at the enveloping level of watching those powerful sequences on a screen that looms at a scale that usually accommodate an opera, and Williams gives the right push for such sensation. Not only did he heightened his mastery akin to Lucas’ growing vision, but he also responded poetically to the visual theming with impeccable synchroneity.

Besides few hindrances from an unsubstantially gimmicky “antagonist” to few questionable executions that validates the noted unevenness, “Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith” is a redemptive testament that stands as its trilogy’s needed peak and suitable transition into the originals. This film has been held in high regards similar to those classics regarding the storytelling impact that continuously ripples across the evolving franchise, particularly “The Clone Wars” then its televised successors that contributed in characterized layers to deepen the grasped depths that were initially witnessed here. While that trilogy is held as high like any classic films for being pure cinema by adventurous innovations, then replicating the experience itself for new generations was attempted in the sequel trilogy’s celebrative, ranging interpretations as current artistic impression gaze, this trilogy of the first prequels (not counting “Rogue One” or “Solo”, which both been ranked superior) firstly replicated its predecessors’ sensations in great mixture that improves by little when solely leading up to the climatic phenomenon. These stories get projected on the screen and continue with maintained entertainment values depend on the retrospective. Both “A New Hope” and “The Force Awakens”, and maybe “The Empire Strikes Back”, should be seen on the big screen just like how “Revenge of the Sith” – imperfect by contrast – proven that realization when justifying the franchise’s categorization as epic space operas than just mere scope.

Rotten Tomatoes, ,Star Wars Episode Iii Revenge Of The Sith,"After rewatching this movie on its 20 year anniversary, I have some things to say. The dialogue towards the beginning is a bit silly, I will admit that. However, around the middle of the film when Palpatine tells Anakin the Sith story and reveals himself to be a Sith Lord, that’s when things really start to become superb. It really does hold up after all this time in almost every way and the CGI looks really good too. The lightsaber action and choreography are at its best and most well done yet. While it is truly sad what ends up happening, you're pretty invested in it emotionally and the film does what it’s supposed to in an epic way. Plus, it brings it all back together in a beautiful way eventually with the original trilogy. The Star Wars score, characters, fun, and universe overall do not let me down one bit in this film!",4.5,5

Rotten Tomatoes,Dave B,Star Wars Episode Iii Revenge Of The Sith,"A return to the cinema to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the 3rd episode of the saga.

This film is the epitome of perfection! It delivers everything you expect from a Star Wars film, and more. The action scenes are arguably the best in the entire saga: every fight, every duel is filmed with incredible intensity, and the final battle between Anakin and Obi-Wan on Mustafar is truly memorable.

Anakin's character is very well developed. We witness his gradual decline, his transformation from hero to traitor, and it's all beautifully orchestrated. The character's internal dilemmas, conflicts, and frustrations are magnified by Hayden Christensen's performance, which portrays an Anakin who is both human and tragic.

This film also leads to a nostalgic ending, perfectly in keeping with the original trilogy. We feel this seamless transition between the events of Anakin and the rise of the Empire, thus providing an emotional conclusion that brilliantly ties the two trilogies together.",5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Cameron M,Star Wars Episode Iii Revenge Of The Sith,"Aged like fine wine...wow!

Not the most fun re-watch, as it's dark, but it is a tragedy, and it's done as true art, with a consistent vision, unlike Episodes 8-9 under Disney executives.

This was probably 3x more enjoyable than my last at-home watch. The big screen experience is amazing. The action is amazing. The complaints are few.

I thought this was the least bad of the first three episodes, but I'm not sure anymore... it's wholly unwatchable at this point.  Natalie Portman, who is an outstanding actor, gives the flattest performance of her career.  She's literally only in the movie to die I'm childbirth which is hugely disappointing.  Haden Christensen's turn to the dark side is mostly unbelievable and his abs are the only thing notable about his performance.  The CGI is so heavily overused that they couldn't even bother to put a storm trooper in an actual costume, instead they sloppily place a human head on a CGI body.  Samuel L Jackson was his normal self, which I generally live, but he was poorly cast to be in these movies.  The only redeeming thing about this movie was minimal Jar Jar Binks...",1,5

Rotten Tomatoes,Christian L,Star Wars Episode Iii Revenge Of The Sith,"Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith, directed by George Lucas, is the third and final film within the Star Wars prequel trilogy. The third film follows Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker's tragic and upsetting transformation into sith lord Darth Vader. As the Clone Wars wager on and political corruption spreads through the Republic, loyalties of everyone in the galaxy are tested and relationships are shattered. The story shows the fall of loved heroes, the rise of an evil empire, and the breaking of bonds that fanatics of Star Wars have loved for years. Revenge of the Sith terrifically balances large scale conflicts with personal heartbreak and drama, creating a film that is not only entertaining but very moving.
What sets Revenge of the Sith apart from some of the other movies in the saga is how masterful it is at really bringing together all aspects of a good film. The cinematography, directed by David Tattersall, is just fantastic. From the battles on foreign planets of the galaxy to the intimate, darker moments with characters you have bonded with, every shot is packed with an intense atmosphere. Shifting toward darker, moodier lighting perfectly mirrors the narrative turn into tragedy. Most recognizable are the fight scenes, choreographed with an intensity and fluid-ness that still stands among the best action sequences in modern cinema, and in my opinion, best of the entire collection.
John Williams' composing deserves its own standing ovation. His compositions for Revenge of the Sith are able to elevate every scene, from the grand ""Battle of the Heroes"" to the devastating ""Anakin's Betrayal."" The music displays the film’s emotional weight while never being overpowering, creating a connection between the audience and the characters' ups and downs. Williams is able to use his composition to truly display character development and emotions, making this soundtrack one of the franchise’s most memorable to date.
 The editing done by Roger Barton and Ben Burtt, is also very well balanced. Despite there being a large amount of narrative ground the film has to cover, it rarely feels rushed or panicked. Key emotional areas of the film are given the space they need to land, while action scenes move with thrilling, perfectly timed momentum. Burtt also served as sound designer, using his skills to create an immersive experience, from blasters firing, rumbling of ships, to lightsaber duels, he captured the audience effectively. 
In terms of storytelling, Revenge of the Sith achieves something special. The film manages to fulfill fan expectations while delivering unfortunate, devastating surprises. Knowing Anakin’s fate does not lessen the film’s emotions, instead, George Lucas’s skilled directing shows how small, tragic decisions succumb to unchangeable downfall. While some earlier prequel lines could be clunky or even forced, Revenge of the Sith had significant, needed improvement. During crucial parts of the film for the storyline, the verbal exchanges between Anakin and Obi-Wan are powerful, showing their brotherly bond, how close they are to each other, and their unfortunate eventual heartbreak. Hayden Christensen is often criticized for his performance in Attack of the Clones. Within Revenge of the Sith he delivers a truly outstanding portrayal of Anakin’s inner conflict. Ewan McGregor’s performance as Obi-Wan Kenobi is also beautiful, displaying a balance between strength, sorrow, and compassion that brings the film together emotionally.
For 2005, the film’s visual effects are outstanding and still hold up well today. Entire digital environments like the planets Mustafar and Coruscant feel very real as if they really exist.  The sets are impressive yet practical, as well as the costumes for what their purpose was. Lucas’ vision for a deteriorating galaxy was made with beautiful attention to detail.
If there are any weaknesses in the film, it is in some of the side character developments. Padmé Amidala, who is played by Natalie Portman, starts strong but becomes a more passive, almost side character as the film progresses. Given Padmé's importance within the series, I feel some Star Wars fanatics wish her character would have been given even more of a role in the final act. However, Natalie Portman brings depth to her role, and her scenes with Anakin carry some heavy weight adding to their development, leading to tragedy.
As for the Star Wars saga, Revenge of the Sith is an essential part for understanding the saga. It closes the gap between the prequels and the original trilogy, giving new development to characters like Darth Vader and Obi-Wan Kenobi, as for many people may not have fully understood the characters of the first trilogy. It reassesses the understanding of certain characters in the Star Wars universe, making Luke and Leia’s future struggles and events even more meaningful.
Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith is/was an absolute achievement in the world of filmmaking. It successfully combines thrilling action, emotional stories, and technical and editing mastery. George Lucas delivered a powerful, tragic film that resonates beyond just being a Star Wars fan, offering insight into friendship, loyalty, and the consequences of fear and ambition, good or bad. With very minor weaknesses, the film holds a very important place in the Star Wars saga and is cherished among fanatics and movie history.
I personally give Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith a 90/100. Happy 20th anniversary!!!",5,5

Poe could have just been a Han Solo clone but he wasn’t, he was a bit scruffy looking but cares about the cause from the beginning and teaming up with Finn a stormtrooper deserter who just wanted to run away finding the courage to face his fears was great, and Kylo Ren easily one of the best parts of the new movies, the new cast flowed well with each other and the old cast which was great to see Han, Chewie, Luke and Leia even though they weren’t all together but this isn’t their story anymore at this point so I was ok with it, action was great, the worlds were great and the story while being a bit of a homage to a New Hope was interesting and made its own path. I can’t recommend it enough, it has earned its well deserved spot in the Star Wars universe.",5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,tim s,Star Wars Episode Vii The Force Awakens,"Generally speaking, The Force Awakens is entertaining, but it's essentially a remake of A New Hope.

The Force Awakens: The New Republic is destroyed, the First Order controls ...alot, they have a planet killing weapon, despite a Republic existing there is a separate ""Resistance"" fighting the New Order, the main threat is a Jedi in exile who they can't find.

It's a retread of A New Hope with some exceptions: better lightsaber combat, better force powers, the superweapon now kills multiple planets instead of just one (though what happens when the sun they drain runs out?).

Rotten Tomatoes,Thomas O,Joker Folie A Deux,"Slow, no plot and not entertaining,is a bad movie",0.5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,J O,Joker Folie A Deux,"The best and also worst part of this movie is that it basically erases everything the first one stands for.
The first one was highly praised, but I have the impression that a lot of people misunderstood its message when it came out, turning the character into some kind of symbol or even a hero that was fighting againstbthe system, but that's just shallow. I've seem countless tattoos of this version of the Joker, and now I'm pretty sure ppl would rather scrape it off than having such character tagging along 24hrs.
The movie is not only boring, but also unappealing. The characters are shallow as Hal, the plot is ridiculous and it never pays off, because everything that happens is gratuitous.
I've watched when it came out in the theaters, and I slept while they where singing about nothing, the musical part doesn't add anything. Don't get me wrong, I'm not a fan of musicals, but I've watched a couple that I've enjoyed, like Moulin Rouge and Tenacious D, I haven't enjoyed Chicago, but at least I vould understand that the songs and dancing were moving the plot foward, that's not the case.
The obly good part is that it threw the character to the ground and buries him so deep no one will even dare do make this version of the Joker an idol again.
Avoid this bomb at all costs.",1,5

Rotten Tomatoes, ,Joker Folie A Deux,I guess people can have their own opinions and can think whatever they want about this movie just still dont understand all the bad reviews. Thought it was well done and all the acting as good as well. I dont get what people hate so much about this whether its the music which did not bother me. You can kinda expect that with Lady Gaga i guess. If people hating the ending more or dont understand it then you missing the point between both movies. This whole timeline and story of Arthur was never meant to be related to Batman where Arthur would be the Joker to fight him. That was never going to happen with Arthur. The Joker is supposed to be an idea of sorts that Arthurs character is going to inspire someone else to be the Joker and that it could come from anyone. Like at this movie you can see that guy was way more crazy and psychotic with the way he was looking at Arthur and laughing at him he definitely sounded more like the Joker. Then also proceeding to carve his face like Heath Ledger. The Joker character is supposed to inspire madness and chaos that again can come from anywhere. Arthur was not the criminal mastermind that like how we all know the Joker to be. I would watch it again honestly to look out more for that guy who becomes the Joker of sorts at the end.,5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Pascal P,Joker Folie A Deux,Am happy not to have went to the theatre to watch this movie… so bad as compared to the first one which was a masterpiece. Phoenix and Gaga are really good actors but the plot and random old school musicals make it so hard to watch,1,5

In my opinion the acting is consistently good (by all): especially Andrew Scott + the x2 young leads.  
The storyline is a little predictable but still charming. Allowing the x2 young leads to remain just friends (without any romantic entanglements) was a good call.
In my view to elevate to a truly GREAT film some of the characters would need to be more nuanced (and not quite as stereotypical as they are - especially the sports teacher & the young bully).",3.5,5

Rotten Tomatoes, ,Handsome Devil,"I came into the movie not knowing anything about it, having discovered it's soundtrack on Spotify, when I thought I was playing a Smith's album. The music is well crafted for the film overall. At first I honestly believed it was one of those good looking vampire type films. A little cliche at times but worth the watch ultimately. Movies with a strong attention to detail really catch my eye, and I think the director did that well; it is often the little things that make a good scene. The strength of the acting really takes this movie above a standard movie of its type. While I think Andrew Scott, and the redhead were the two strongest actors for this film, I think each of the main character actors brings their own sense of importance to each of the main roles.",3.5,5
Rotten Tomatoes, ,Handsome Devil,This movie really made me sick. It is not progressive in any way and does not invent anything new. What it can is play with old clichés and disappoint the audience.

Rotten Tomatoes,johann m,Handsome Devil,"An Irish film which follows two opposites, a loner and the top athlete, who become friends at a rugby-obsessed boarding school, and whose friendship will be tested by those who despise it. A sweet and refreshing movie about LGBTQ+ representation in characters that are stereo-typically straight and which sets an example for other movies to include gay athletes or sports players playing a significant part in the victory of a team. Even in life itself, this should stop being a matter of discrimination and prejudice. Maybe the world is not ready for gay soccer players or rugby players, but it should be.",4,5
Rotten Tomatoes, ,Handsome Devil,"'Handsome Devil' é um dos filmes mais acessíveis dessa lista, ele se encontra disponível em grandes serviços de stream. Talvez por isso, ele seja referência para muitos quando o tema é filmes gays com final feliz (embora aqui, o final seja aberto assim como na maioria dos filmes da lista).
Partindo de um ponto bastante atraente, o roteiro consegue capturar a atenção do público, principalmente por conta dos elementos bastante requisitados pela grande massa: colegial, descobertas, resistência ao aceitar quem você é e o tão simbólico bullying, que acaba fortalecendo o protagonista. 
A clássica história do valentão que em um certo momento desabrocha como uma bela flor no jardim é contada numa pespectiva que busca enaltecer a progressão dos personagens, mesmo que demorada e pouco explicada ela seja. Contudo, a persistência do protagonista parece moldar o final da história, que depende unicamente do esforço direto e quase sempre assertivo - mas que sempre se mantém numa zona neutra e pouco desenvolvida.",3,5
Rotten Tomatoes, ,Handsome Devil,"A quirky and vibrant setting of a boys boarding school. The story is charming, funny and invigorating. It pulls your heart strings as you feel both struggle and companionship toil in the boys' dilemma. The honing moral is that if ""You're going to spend all your life being someone else. Who is going to be you?""

While the adorable and cute cast chosen and the mostly warming characters that have been portrayed paint a very vanilla dream (as I can't imagine this in real life!), there is much to be enjoyed from this film.",4.5,5

Rotten Tomatoes,David F,The Take 2016,"Bastille Day [aka The Take]. It's an OK action thriller, set in France, with a leading role for Idris Elba, doing his American accent. He (and the other leads) are all pretty good, though the two main villains look very similar and it's hard to tell who is who.  The script is formulaic, almost as though it's been written by an AI, but some of these clichés are fun.  Idris sings the feeem choon at the end.",3,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Robert K,The Take 2016,An unimaginative set peice that somehow still manages to fail at casting any sort of shadow of its own. Idris Elba is a fine actor and played his part as expected. Richard Madden's emotional expressions felt crowbarred out of him at points. Predictable twists. Disappointing.,2,5
Rotten Tomatoes,K. J,The Take 2016,Terrible movie. So low rent on every level. Utterly unbelievable. Cartoon characters. Bad script. Bad acting. How do projects like this get the green light?,2,5
Rotten Tomatoes,R 9,The Take 2016,"Pretty good, for what it is. 'Bastille Day', or 'The Take' for us in my neck of the woods, is a sound action thriller that suitably entertains.

Idris Elba has played this sorta role many a time but there's no doubting how strongly he performs in such films. He and co-star Richard Madden are sporting distracting (at least to someone who knows them more for their native tongue) accents, but are a solid pairing... their (admittedly somewhat minimal) buddy cop-esque banter isn't the best, though.

Elba also appears in the end credits singing... not to great effect, I gotta say. Don't get me wrong I know that guy can very much do music, it's just that this song is, erm, not his strongest work, let's just say that.

It's largely predictable, though it does things in a manner that kept me interested and enjoying what I was setting eyes on. So it gets a pass from yours truly.",3,5

Rotten Tomatoes,Matt P,The Take 2016,"Even the Mrs liked this. Look, I'm not a fan of Idris whatsoever. I don't think he'd fit James Bond either. Not due to age because that's not important but I think he lacks the charisma that other bonds have possessed to play 007. I wasn't happy with his behaviour during lockdown hence he was one of the first celebs to declare he got it nor am I happy with some of his performances in various other films. Very over hyped. The only reason people are sweet on him is because girls of today like Black guys (hmm wonder why) let's be honest here. They don't even care if the movie is good. 

He does have presence. But, he is a little better than I give him credit for. In this movie, which I almost didn't bother watching because of his latest movies being way over hyped, he was a really good fit. Back to form. Hope it continues. He deserves better roles. I liked him alongside the rock and statham, but then he opts for theatre or some other silly roles where he doesn't show his best. Perhaps his best days are behind him, maybe that's a challenge I'd like him to push himself like he did here and get into the role. The other lead who played the pick Pocket did well too. 

What annoyed me though is how come the French police didn't arrest the guy if his face was shown on the news? Wouldn't his face be shown around the globe quickly? Maybe I missed this. Just a bit weak in certain areas because they were in a rush for the chase scene to kick off and to get on with things. Missed out some of the better more realistic details that could have made this film much better. And realistic, does more than thrills. The two go together you know. Tip for Netflix there. Keep it as realistic as possible. Don't miss out on things that don't add up. Oh and easy on the police brutality. This doesn't need to catch on in Paris.. oh no wait.",2.5,5

Rotten Tomatoes,Blu B,Get Out,"All Time Classic. One of the best Horror films of the decade and highly original. This is always one step away from being exploitation shlock but the really good direction of Peele, the sharp script, and the smart way it handles it's human and racial undertones is what helps it triumph. My complaints are really minor here. The music is really good but I wish it was a bit more catchy and distinct on its own. The editing is editing is really good but it can get a little muddled in the middle with him meeting the other people. The acting is really good too. The veteran actors here like the parents really help ebcause they ahve great chemistry with Chris and their daughter. The performances walk a very fine line between ebing unsettling and unatural vs. The Happening type stuff. I wish sometimes it was maybe a bit more human but it fits for such a weird and bonkers story. Everything else is first rate. The setting is super memorable. The imagery is highly original too in the horror scenes. This isn't a gore fest and relies on building interesting characters in a very weird and unsettling way. You wanna know more and more and that's really what sets this a part for me. Than once the wheels come off it becomes really disturbing and has a really good twist. Looking back it makes perfect sense. Rod is the best thing in this film and deserves his own TSA spinoff series. I love him. While it can be a bit on the nose at first with the racial message, it does become more focused on the characters and crazy world with the messaging become much more subdued. It's shlock but very sophisticated. It's intelligent and batsh*t crazy. It's not really a gore fest until the very end but it's true intellectual horror. Everyone should give this a try once.",5,5

Eye candy, and that's pretty much it.

The Good: The animation and art direction were amazing. 

The Bad: This movie is 90% about Princess Peach. Mario just happened to tag along for the ride. You can tell this movie was initially about Princess Peach being a boss girl and then a bunch of cuts were made and more Mario and Luigi was added in. The beginning was added later in because it was all about Mario and Luigi. Then as they transported, the tone of the movie switched to Princess Peach and it stayed that way until the last 5 minutes when things switched back to Mario and Luigi to end the movie.

Rotten Tomatoes,Axel K,A Minecraft Movie,"When I got out of the cinema, there was nothing important left of the film in my mind, I couldn't even judge and talk of the movie with my friend, it was a silence...

The humour is pretty good, though some of it is very repetitive and only works once. But a good kid movie shouldn't only rely on the fun, and instead have also a good story to tell, which is not the case: I didn't feel any moral attention for the group or sense of danger with the vilan.

The biggest missed point in my opinion is the fact that the movie doesn't give me a will to explore the world (irl and minecraft) because the set and background feel to fake, and not close to the game's atmosphere.

Jack black saves the film from being just annoying. It's not a bad movie !",2.5,5

Rotten Tomatoes,SA G,Border 2018,"One of the most bizarre, creative movies I've seen in a long time.  An absolute thriller mystery that knocks your socks off!",5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Jens B,Border 2018,"A beautiful love story wrapped in a Swedish crime story plot, the kind you could find on the ARD media library. Everything about Tina's self-discovery and first love touched me deeply. Abbasi finds a way to convey his concerns to the world in subtle nuances.

The crime story construct is also important for these concerns, but here it all becomes too blatant for me. Some dialogue no longer feels natural, but rather constructed solely for the audience's aha! moment. And that's a real shame.

Because the interplay of love story and crime story, a slow and methodical pacing, and two wonderful leading actors give ""Gräns"" a slowly but surely building emotional impact that leaves you thinking for a while after the credits roll.",3.5,5

Rotten Tomatoes,Elena B,Border 2018,"""I don't want to hurt anyone.  Is it human to think that way?""  A great movie, thought provoking and liberating for the soul.  I also loved the folklore and the brilliant self-expression in the face of societal constraints.  One reviewer here said it was difficult to like something so different.  This may have been the point of the movie, to make us aware of how limited our thinking can be at times.",5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Wayne K,Border 2018,"A film that uses weirdness to its full advantage, Border tells a story that I often interpreted as being about the assimilation of immigrants into their adopted society. Tina is an outcast, shunned and mocked by civilisation, living a lonely existence with little hope of making a true human connection. She has one foot in the ‘troll world’ and one in the human world, an obvious outsider but still living a transparently human life, with a job, home and acquaintances. I figured the film was trying to say that it doesn’t matter where you’re from, everyone can find a place to fit in. The make up is incredible, as are the lead performances, particularly from Eva Melander. It takes a lot of courage to take on a role like this, and she really sells both the sentimental moments and the intense ones. It’s an odd experience by design, and if that’s your thing, then I'd highly recommend this one.",3.5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Thomas S,Border 2018,"A vivid story about self-acceptance and vengeance. The rhythm was perfect : I got hooked from start to finish. The scenario could have dwelled on the story of trolls and why they got hunted down, but instead focused on the ""human"" side of things, which makes its strength. Top notch! Got flashbacks from the excellent ""Trollhunter"" from 2010",5,5

Rotten Tomatoes,David W,Border 2018,"This was quite a challenging watch in many ways and I don't just mean it's slow Scandinavian slow burner pacing. It is brilliantly acted and that most rare of beasts, unique. It's a film I'm glad I watched as it did hold my attention throughout but wether I can say I actively enjoyed it is a different matter. I can certainly see why the professional critics liked this so much and conversely why your average movie watcher may well not. Definitely a polarising experience of a movie but one I'd recommend purely to see which camp you fall into. Be warned though, if you approach this expecting a straightforward horror movie per se then you'll most likely be dissapointed.",4,5

stay away from the plague as far as you can I had to skip forward just to see its end and be done with it.",0.5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Jeff M,Border 2018,"You'll often hear someone hyperbolically describing a movie by saying you've never seen anything like it. Well, when it comes to this Swedish film, currently available on Hulu, believe me, you've never seen anything like it. I don't even know where to begin with a review. I can't give it a full recommendation, but at the same time I am dying to hear what you all think about this. If you decide to take the dive, a few warnings. It is EXTREMELY slow - and this is coming from someone who loves slow, leisurely paced movies. If you only like movies that make sense at the end, give this a pass. And if the consumption of maggots and worms makes you ill, concentrate your attention elsewhere. But if you are in the mood for something different and unique and challenging, this is a movie about which you can be proud to say you took the plunge. My guess is that most people won't get past the first 30 minutes. Just between you and me, it took me two tries.",2.5,5

Rotten Tomatoes,Brandon K,Wild At Heart,This film is a wonderful adaption of the Barry Gifford series of books about Sailor and Lula in a very Lynchian take.  Unfortunately most people are reluctant to watch it because it was early on in Cage's career and Willem Dafoe's portrayal as Bobby Peru is a miscarriage of an academy award.  This movie is not for the faint of heart but is definately one of my top 5 favorite picks.,5,5

Rotten Tomatoes,Andrew O,Wild At Heart,"This movie is a classic and very underrated. The performances by Dern and Cage are unparalleled in their careers, which is saying a lot for those two. The love story feels real and their connection is timeless. The secondary characters are also well built, but Dafoe was at the top of his game and one scary dude. The sexual tension of this movie mixed with the psychotic impulses of Ladd’s character make it extremely unique. It is strange, and Cage’s Elvis like persona with the snakeskin jacket is so cool to watch. This is a dark movie and pushes viewers into uncomfortable territory, but it my favorite David Lynch project.",5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Michael V,Wild At Heart,"A wild and crazy love story.

Wild at Heart is a 1990 American romantic crime comedy-drama thriller film written and directed by David Lynch 🥰 

It’s good 🙂
Worth a watch. 
I’d recommend it if you like this genre 👍🏼

This captivating movie is led by the amazing performances and chemistry between Cage and Dern.

Young lovers Sailor and Lula hit the road to start a new life together away from the wrath of Lula’s deranged, disapproving mother, who has hired a team of hitmen to cut the lovers’ surreal honeymoon short.",3.5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Mason M,Wild At Heart,"A bad David Lynch movie is still a good movie. I would dare to say it's Lynch's most shocking, partially due to it opening with Nicolas Cage beating a man to death. Nothing would imply it in the movie but the world that it creates feels like a twisted hell. A good film but it doesn't give us much to connect to with the characters and never gives a reason why the world of the film is the way that it is.",3,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Sams K,Wild At Heart,Very good one. Cage and Dern are a hit-couple here with a disturbing Dafoe and of course a terrific Harry Dean Stanton.,4,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Petros T,Wild At Heart,"Pros: an unhinged Willem Dafoe, some unexpected but delicious splatter and a polka dot dress. Cons: just about everything else. The lead is a half-decent Elvis impersonator, we're constantly teased with footage of fire as if a great reveal is coming, everything related to Marietta is straight out of a soap opera, and from a certain point on, the story just feels random: inconsequential encounters, half the main characters disappearing and then teleporting out of nowhere, and a mawkish finale.",2,5

The actors knocked it out of the park and their characters have been given a HUGE improvement from the last movie. In fact, everything has been vastly improved since the 2016 version.

Rotten Tomatoes, ,The Suicide Squad,"Eu achava que ia ser bem mais frufruzento, até que foi ok",2.5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Angel C,The Suicide Squad,"“A Wild, Hilarious, and Heartfelt Rollercoaster!”

James Gunn’s The Suicide Squad is nothing short of a triumph, breathing new life into DC’s cinematic universe with its bold storytelling, unforgettable characters, and relentless energy. This is not just a superhero movie—it’s a chaotic, wildly entertaining spectacle that refuses to play by the rules, and that’s what makes it brilliant.

The film thrives on its colorful ensemble cast, led by standout performances from Margot Robbie as the always-iconic Harley Quinn, Idris Elba as the compelling Bloodsport, and John Cena, who steals scenes as the hilariously over-the-top Peacemaker. Every character feels distinct and memorable, even the ones you wouldn’t expect to care about. Gunn’s ability to balance absurd humor with deeply emotional moments ensures you’re laughing one moment and tearing up the next.

Visually, the film is stunning, with vibrant cinematography and jaw-dropping action sequences that are as creative as they are explosive. Gunn’s signature style is on full display, combining quirky humor, killer music, and a surprising amount of heart. The R-rated edge gives the movie the freedom to go all out, delivering some of the most inventive and unapologetically fun sequences ever seen in a superhero film.

What truly sets The Suicide Squad apart is its heart. Beneath the chaos and carnage is a story about redemption, teamwork, and finding humanity in even the most unlikely places. Gunn has turned a group of misfit criminals into a team worth rooting for, proving that sometimes the worst of the worst can be the best.

Whether you’re a die-hard DC fan or just someone looking for a fresh, action-packed, and hilarious adventure, The Suicide Squad is a must-see. It’s a game-changer for the DC Universe and one of the most enjoyable films of 2021.

Rating: 9.5/10 – Bold, brilliant, and absolutely bonkers in the best way possible!",5,5

The film gives a decent amount of time to the team's origin story and their discovery of their powers, but the actual comic book plot boils down to a minor showdown with a lackluster Doctor Doom.

Rotten Tomatoes,Thomas F,Fantastic Four,"As a Marvel fan and a huge fan of the Fantastic 4, this movie is so enjoyable. Yeah yeah, the CGI is bad, it deviates from the comics, blah blah, shut your noise hole. It's a great story and setting to put these superheroes in. It doesn't have to be true to the comics. And might I just say, Julian McMahone is the perfect villan actor. His performance as Doctor Doom was increcible  and I know you all are afraid to admit that because you all think this movie sucks. I adore this movie and I'll watch it anytime.",4.5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Rick C,Fantastic Four,"I've decided this is the best superhero movie ever made. Chris Evans making out with a girl who is driving a car, while he is also driving a motorcycle? Iconic. One hour and forty-six minutes of Jessica Alba eye candy? Iconic. All of Ben's condescending nicknames for his team members? Iconic. My only real critique is wondering how Fortnite had a better Dr. Doom than a blockbuster Fantastic Four movie.",4.5,5
Rotten Tomatoes, ,Fantastic Four,"It is okay. It was entertaining enough. This movies biggest weakness is the Invisible Woman. She has little to no personality in this movie. You know what you learn about the Invisible Woman in this movie? Nothing other than her gender. What do I mean by this? She is heavily sexualized and lacks personality. This is my main takeaway from this movie.

The acting is excellent, the cg is top notch and still looks good for the time, but most importantly the story is solid. Tony's redemption arch is one of the best I've seen in a film honestly. To see him change from the womanizing profit seeking narcissist he is at the beginning of the film to the selfless and heroic individual he becomes later is really touching. On top of all that, the movie is just plain fun! It's funny, it's got great action (even if the later mcu movies had better action sequences), and it was the perfect start to the Marvel Cinematic Universe",5,5

The voice actors (most notably Vin Diesel) did a very good job and there were some scenes that were quite mature, even for younger children who might also watch this film (such as the hunting scene with the guns and the deer). The animation was quite good as well, specifically the Iron Giant effects and how it meshed with the cartoon animation. By the end, it turned into a film that almost made me cry since it almost fools you into believing it has a sad ending with the Iron Giant's demise of sacrifice.

The characters are shallow and self absorbed - wealthy enough to travel a lot but to never worry about it at all in grindingly impoverished places.

Despite having a surprisingly stacked cast and the budget to film on location across the world, it only results in a bland vanilla self-discovery film. Julia Roberts as Liz Gilbert is a white savior first-ballot Hall of Famer, going 3/3 when it comes to “enlightening” or “enriching” the people in the countries she travels to. Ryan Murphy should stick to working his voodoo on TV shows as this film’s structure and pacing is a hot mess, that ironically would’ve probably worked better as a television miniseries. Too much material from the original memoir was attempted to be crammed into a film, resulting in it feeling rushed and not allowing the viewer enough time to grow attached to any of the supporting characters.",1,5

to anyone who didn’t know the lore, the story and characters make little to no sense, while anyone who does know the lore will be disappointed that it diverges so far in every aspect, making this movie look unrecognizable in comparison to the franchise, being most disappointed by the potential this movie had.

this movie may have been the worst of the 4 lego movies, but the bay is so high that this still manages to be ridiculously funny as well with good dialogue, great line delivery, and a touching(but slightly fragile), mostly coherent story.

Rotten Tomatoes,SkyRo P,The Lego Ninjago Movie,"As I set out to review the Ninjago series, I must admit I had rather modest expectations for a Lego-themed franchise. I assumed it would be a light and somewhat silly experience, one that I wouldn't find particularly engaging or enjoyable.

To my surprise, I was completely wrong. Ninjago turned out to be a charming revelation, providing an incredibly fun and captivating viewing experience. Both my child and I were drawn into every facet of this franchise, from the movies and shorts to the various episodes.

The characters in Ninjago are not only amusing but also experience substantial growth throughout the series. Characters like Ty and Zane, along with the entire cast, evolve in ways that allow viewers to become deeply invested in their personal journeys and the larger narrative.

What impressed me the most was how the characters earned their powers through their adventures, instilling a sense of progression and achievement. The gradual introduction of new characters, alongside the phased-out exit of older ones, created an engaging dynamic, reminiscent of passing the baton to a new generation.

In conclusion, I enthusiastically recommend the Ninjago franchise to audiences of all ages. Whether kids watch it on their own or families enjoy it together, the series offers a vibrant and imaginative Lego experience that is sure to entertain and inspire everyone.",3,5

Rotten Tomatoes,Born  K,Waste-Land,"Nominated for best documentary for the Academy in 2012.

I don't know if I could be wrong but some of the the reviews here are very negative from those who live in Brazil. The point of view is valid from what people say negatively about documentaries, but I also agree with another aspect - in the same way that the impact of knowing that your painting is worth so much more than you as a person in a landfill, it also shows the perspective that things can be different if you believe and fight for it, no matter how small the fight - growing in literacy, courses, and other things that I don't think people read that changed on the lives of those shown as is stated at the end of the film.

He didn't take advantage of these people's lives, I believe he had a purpose and followed through by donating the profits from sales back to them. Many times, to pursue something in life you need to have something to ignite the change in your perspective and that's what he at least tries to do, something most people don't even try (as several ones that criticize his work here). As a note, Jardim Gramacho was closed in 2012 after operating for 35 years and providing compensation to the collectors and the waste was sent to the Waste Treatment Center in Seropédica.

The president of the collectors' association Tião fought for their rights, in numbers around 5,000 of them, to have investment in training for new roles in 15 years in addition to unemployment benefits and around 15 thousand reais in compensation for each one.

In other words, it's not exactly like everyone returned to their previous life - or in other words, learn to research and read before giving opinions.

Vik is not a dazzled one as many people try to portray him - the son of people from Pernambuco who migrated to São Paulo, he managed to attend FAAP and moved to NY in 1983 at the age of 22, speaking almost no English, after being shot in the leg by an accidental bullet while trying to help the victim of a fight at a party - took the compensation money received and went to live in suburban Chicago with a maternal aunt, working various minor jobs (as a butcher shop cleaner) until deciding to move to the East Village in NY looking for minor jobs associated with art until having their first success in 1988.

Because of his dyslexia, Muniz's grandmother read him the Encyclopedia Britannica, the only book they had on the shelf. At age seven, Muniz could read but could not yet write and instead, he began to draw compulsively in his notebooks and developed a writing system that only he could understand.

In 1975, at the age of fourteen, Vik Muniz earned money repairing televisions, and around the same time a teacher saw his drawings and recommended his participation in a state-sponsored arts festival held among public schools.

As a result of his unparalleled talent, Muniz participated in this competition and won a partial scholarship to study at a drawing and sculpture academy (FAAP). As he recalls, his three years learning to draw and model geometric solids and nudes taught him almost everything about art. (content from arteref.com website).

In other words, understanding the person's context helps to understand the work and the artist's original intention...or to learn to red what the pre credits scene did tell.",4,5

Rotten Tomatoes, ,Waste-Land,"Vik Muniz, Brazilian by birth but living in the US, as he returns to Brazil to photograph the workers at the world's biggest garbage dump. The workers pick recyclables from the garbage, and the film captures their ecosystem. I found the story of the community and social and political structure that exists because of the employment opportunities fascinating. But the best part is watching the photographer create his photographs using the workers and the garbage they collect as subjects and how the film tells a richer story about the human condition. The credits indicate that the exhibition of this work in Brazil was the second most popular ever.

Rotten Tomatoes,The M,Land Of The Dead,"Almost 20 years after DAY OF THE DEAD, We finally have  George Romero‘s magnum OPUS ,made of a $15 million budget and with big stars like John Leguizamo and Simon Baker. Not to mention Dennis Hopper and Asia Argento. Romero still hits all aces With his fourth outing.",3.5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,John C,Land Of The Dead,"First of all, let me say that I'm a big zombie movie fan. And, as a big zombie movie fan, I'm naturally a fan of the `grandfather of modern zombie movies' George A Romero. For those of you who don't know, he gave us Night of the Living Dead, Dawn of the Dead and Day of the Dead - all largely regarded as classics in their own right/time.

Now, nearly twenty years later (and among the influx of `modern' post-nineties zombie films, he brings us in fourth instalment in the saga `Land of the Dead.' This is set after the living dead have taken over the world and the last human survivors have held up in a large city with high walls and rivers on all sides to protect themselves from the undead threat.

The way I see Land of the Dead - it's like a complicated jigsaw puzzle that's all there, yet somehow doesn't fit together properly. There are a lot of good bits in the film: the characters are good (yet under-developed), the setting is good (yet under-used), the story is good (yet doesn't really go in any one direction). The whole film, although an enjoyable entry in the series, just seems a little off, as if George just missed an opportunity to make Land of the Dead as truly great as its three predecessors.

A lot of criticism falls on the zombies. People don't like the way they're `evolved,' i.e. they've started thinking more than your average `walker.' However, anyone who's seen Day of the Dead and remembers a zombie called `Bub' will know that they've started to think about new ways to get their prey.

Perhaps the biggest problem is that, despite George normally being quite thorough in his story-telling, has left large gaps which defy logic. The characters do some damn silly things which probably wouldn't happen in real life. This somehow degrades the whole feel of the film and reduces it to just another slasher film where stupid people do stupid things which result in them getting killed simply to add gore to a film.

I didn't hate Land of the Dead. Far from it. I'm one of the people who sticks up for it on internet message boards. However, I will accept that it has its flaws and could have been fixed with a little tightening on some areas of the script and expanded on other areas which are genuinely interesting.
The fact is that George A Romero needed a financially viable hit so that people would still give him money to make further films. Therefore, instead of sticking to a film that would simply be enjoyed by die-hard zombie enthusiasts (such as myself!), he made a film that was more appealing to the masses. This resulted in a film that was slightly more `Resident Evil' than `... of the Dead.'

Don't hate it, just do your best to accept that it's not perfect, but still a damn sight better than 90% of the numerous zombie B-movie cash-ins that are out there right now.

(The truck/tank `Dead Reckoning' is cool enough to warrant watching the film on its own - I want to drive it in the event of an undead uprising!)",4,5

Rotten Tomatoes,DanTheMan 2,Land Of The Dead,"Signifying Romero's jump into the digital age, Land of the Dead is another hard-edged, funny, playfully perverse and violent exercise in fear and loathing. Its increasingly dark take on a world spinning out of control makes for good, gory fun, even if its satiric jabs at societal mores are more heavy-handed than in the past. It's nice to see Romero working with something actually approaching a budget for once, boldly holding a macabre mirror up to post-9/11 America with that familiar squelch of human flesh, tackling gated communities, war profiteering and entertainment as a weapon of mass distraction. While I don't ultimately agree with some of the film's decisions, the intelligent zombies being my main peeve (although it feels natural due to Romero constantly evolving his ghouls with each instalment), it's hard to deny that Romero still cares enough about the genre he helped redefine, he doesn't attempt to play it safe, taking every opportunity he can to challenge his viewers. His direction is solid, although let down by a muddy colour palette, the practical effects are fantastic when they haven't had digital touch-ups but the music uses way too many rising string leitmotifs for my liking. The performances from the cast are certainly a mixed bag but it's clear that John Leguizamo and Dennis Hopper are having a ball in their respective roles, although I do wish that Asia Argento had bitten the dust faster, also a cameoing Simon Pegg as a Zombified Shaun is an adorable touch. Although Land of the Dead is too familiar to be unnerving, there's at least satisfaction in Romero making it such nasty fun, it's far from the triumphs of his Dead trilogy but it serves up a decent plate of B-movie grade shock and awe.",3.5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Andrew P,Land Of The Dead,"Land of the Dead is an interesting next step in Romero's ""of the Dead"" franchise, but it definitely feels like a step down from the previous films.",3,5
Rotten Tomatoes,B S,Land Of The Dead,"For some reason it’s the first opening minutes of this movie what creeps me out the most it’s with the news commentators speaking and the images in the background of the zombies returning to life really gets me its just creepy as hell and it’s the only zombie movie that scares me😂, but to me i personally think out of all the zombie movies I’ve seen and I’d like to say I’ve seen them all I see this as the best I’ve watched it’s just down right creepy, chilling and disturbing plus the replay value is 10/10 in my opinion, George Romero Is a legend and a genius when it comes to zombie movies and if your a fan of them then I would 100% recommend this.",5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Sams K,Land Of The Dead,"It's a shame Romero didn't have the opportunity to do all the movies he wanted to do, because this one's really great! Lots of references of the early 2000s political scenario. YOU MUST WATCH THIS!!!",4.5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Lucas T,Land Of The Dead,"One of the best zombie movies out there. It’s great to see what Romero can do with a full budget and it does not disappoint. Love the social commentary and the zombie effects are masterful. A lot of people I know prefer Snyder’s Dawn of the Dead Remake to this one which came out very close to each other, but Land is definitely the superior film imo.",5,5

Rotten Tomatoes,Alec B,Land Of The Dead,"Its strange to see a Romero picture with a decent budget, actual stars, and major studio backing. The film mostly works as Romero gives the usually mindless hordes of zombies something interesting to do this time, I just wish the political/social commentary was a little less on the nose.",3.5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Bob A,Land Of The Dead,Love how George did this one. Entertaining and fun,4.5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Adrian B,Land Of The Dead,"It's not as good as the original trilogy and the characters aren't really noteworthy but it has some cool kills and some good effects. Twenty years later, George Romero can still make a good zombie movie and the best of the new trilogy.",3.5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Andre G,Land Of The Dead,Not the best zombie movie I ever seen. It is ok. It takes a few times of watching it to really get the whole concept of the movie. Could have made the storyline a little better. Hey really all that matters is that theirs a lot of killing zombies and zombie killings happening.,3,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Drew F,Land Of The Dead,This is easily the best zombie film of all time. Romero fine tuned his style for decades. Then he gifted us this pinnacle of zombies-as-blockbuster entertainment and zombies as thinly veiled satire. Both parts are firing on all cylinders in this one.,5,5

Rotten Tomatoes,EGMR 9,Birdman 2014,"This is a must-watch for anyone interested in pursuing a career in theatre. The performances were all fantastic, and the way the film is presented is just as impressive - it appears as though most of the film was all done in one take, even though it obviously wasn't. At the same time, though, you never notice any of the cuts, so I'll have to give editors Douglas Crise and Stephen Mirrione credit where credit is due. But all that to say, even though it did win Best Picture, I personally thought ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" was the better film. This film's great too, though.",4,5

Probably not for everyone, but the concept of a washed-up celebrity trying to regain that prestige with an internal demon represented by a superhero he played in his past is executed wonderfully.

Rotten Tomatoes,Samuel W,Birdman 2014,"This was a movie that I was not aware would be more satire against the superhero genre than it was a superhero movie. This movie is very interesting in its concept and I really love how it is in “one shot” continuously throughout the film. With Michael Keaton, Emma Stone, Edward Norton, and a slew of other great actors playing amazing characters. The movie is emotional, funny, ridiculous, and everything in-between, with an onslaught of clever and raw moments fit for anyone who has an interest in theatre, movies, or acting. It really did feel like the perfect example of a tortured artist, whether that was the intent or not. This movie is great for anyone who has ever had a creative drive fail on them.",4,5

It puts me on edge in a good way where I wonder how will everything go wrong like a car crash I can’t look away from in slow motion that I definitely need to rewatch sometime.",4,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Jose S,Birdman 2014,"What do we talk about when we talk about love, life, loss and eternity?Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow,
Creeps in this petty pace from day to day,
To the last syllable of recorded time;
And all our yesterdays have lighted fools
The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle!
Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player,
That struts and frets his hour upon the stage,
And then is heard no more. It is a tale
Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,
Signifying nothing.

It´s better to embrace the unexpected virtue of ignorance...",5,5

Rotten Tomatoes,Charles H,Creed 2015,I’ve never been a fan of sports movies because I always thought they were too inspirational and kinda cheesy and even overlooked Rocky for a while.

Rotten Tomatoes,Shaun R,Creed 2015,Stallone is great yet again. They could have totally screwed this film up and spoiled some of Rocky’s legacy but it kept somewhat realistic. Adonis is no Apollo but that’s no great shame.,4,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Jay W,Creed 2015,"When it was first announced that there was going to be a 7th installment in the ""Rocky"" franchise I was skeptical. Unlike ""Star Wars"", ""Harry Potter"" or other franchises that hit 7 movies, each Rocky movie is written as if it is going to be its last. Rocky in 1976 is a self-contained story where no sequel is needed. Thankfully sequels were made because it went on to be one of the most consistently high-quality series of all-time. But because of the way they make the movies to be the last, each new entry comes with a new slew of old jokes. By the 6th entry, ""Rocky Balboa"" the series had already become a punchline for series overstaying their welcome. Shows like ""Family Guy"", ""The Simpsons"", ""The Critic"", ""Animaniacs"" and ""SNL"" had all already made jokes at the expense of Rocky getting too old to keep making these movies. I am a huge fan of the Rocky films. In fact, it is my all-time favorite movie series. So naturally I am very protective of how it is handled. I was all set to hate this movie. I had already written in my mind the title of my review: ""Creed, more like Greed"". But before I could pat myself on the back for writing such a witty title, I watched the film and... dang, I was 100% wrong.

This movie is SO GOOD. Emotionally, it is the hardest hitting of any of the Rocky movies. Yes, Stallone should have won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor, it will be seen as one of the biggest snubs in the Academy. On top of that, Michael B. Jordan, Tessa Thompson, Ryan Coogler and ""Creed"" itself all were due an Oscar for this. I know it was a good year, ""Fury Road"" was also an excellent legacy sequel to a 70's franchise. ""Force Awakens"" was also that year but hands down ""Creed"" walks away as the winner from those films.

Stallone plays Rocky in this film, not as the same man doing the same things as last time we saw him, as if he is a man frozen in time just waiting for the next movie to start living. He plays him as a natural progression of where the character would be at this stage in his life. He has lines of dialogue that are powerful and thought provoking, but they don't sound like they came from a studio full of writers. The lines feel like they came from the heart.

Michael B. Jordan is such a likable protagonist. It hearkens back to what have always made these films great. They are not films about boxing, they are films about people. And what makes these characters engaging is that they are all in some way broken. As Rocky said in the first film, they have gaps. The romance between Jordan and Thompson is beautiful and believable. It feels real, the conversations they have sound like two people just talking and being real with each other. We the audience just happen to be a fly on the wall of what is going on.

The boxing action and training montages are also handled very well. There are a couple of fights before the end that are some of the most visceral fights in any movie I've seen. There are moments in this movie that are some of the very best of the series.

This movie had a moment that made me get up out of the seat and punch the air in celebration. This movie is so good at what it does, there is an edit, with no dialogue, that got me to shed a tear. If you were hesitant on whether to give the seventh movie in a franchise the chance, or heck, even if you have never seen a ""Rocky"" movie, WATCH THIS MOVIE. It is one of the best I've seen in the last 20 years. It is a winner.",5,5

Rotten Tomatoes,matthias s,Creed 2015,"""Creed"" is a brilliant continuation of the ""Rocky' franchise, breathing new life into the series while honoring its legacy. As a Rocky fan, it was incredible seeing Stallone return as the beloved character, offering a more grounded, mentor-like role. Michael B. Jordan is phenomenal as Adonis Creed, capturing both the physicality and emotional depth needed for the role. The bond between Rocky and Adonis is the film's heart, and their relationship drives much of the emotional weight. The music, acting, and fight sequences are all top-tier, keeping me captivated from start to finish. It’s a perfect mix of nostalgia and fresh energy. This is exactly how you revive a franchise; with respect, heart, and an eye for the future. I teared up several times, as it’s packed with raw emotion. ""Creed"" stands tall in the ""Rocky"" legacy, a must-watch for fans and newcomers alike.",4.5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Korzer L,Creed 2015,Creed is a great continuation of the Rocky franchise that uses legacy in a really meaningful way.

made  an  impression  on  people  who  are  used  to
watching  adventure  and  fantasy  films.  Pirates  of  the
Caribbean  is  an  amazing  movie  about  pirates  with
adventure atmosphere and love aftertaste. This film is

and successful actors! Here are some of them: The
actor of the main character, Jack Sparrow is Jonny
Depp. He did a great job of conveying the character of
his character. Will Turner, one of the most important
characters was played by Orlando Bloom, who made
Will look like real person by adding some details. The

famous cast and great camerawork. In the series there
are 4 more films about Pirates of the Caribbean.
Watching this film will satisfy your adventure spirit!",5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,matthias s,Monsters Inc,"*Monsters, Inc.* is pure nostalgic gold. As a kid, I adored it—and honestly, I still do. That jazzy soundtrack instantly takes me back, and the character designs? Genius. Each monster is so well-matched to their voice and vibe, it's wild. The premise—scaring kids for power—is weirdly brilliant, and packed with clever worldbuilding. The yellow snow cone joke? Still hilarious. There’s heart, there’s comedy, there’s a big ol’ Pixar hug wrapped around it all. It’s top-tier family entertainment with real emotional punch.

Rotten Tomatoes,Jay W,Monsters Inc,"""Monsters INC"" is a terrific Pixar film during a run where the company was making nothing but bangers. It is easy to look back and just see it as just another good film in Pixar's line up. But, at the time, this was the first truly great Pixar movie not starring Woody and Buzz. This was the movie that made the company of Pixar synonymous with quality and not just ""Toy Story"". It was among the first group to be nominated for the new Academy category: ""Best Animated Picture"".

The story has a very clever premise. There is a world of monsters who enter our world through children's' closets. And the monsters bottle kids' screams and use it as electricity. In, what has now become a Pixar staple, they explain this high concept in a manner that audiences of all ages can understand.

The animation is great. The character design for the monsters are all varied, unique and charming. The voice acting of John Goodman and Billy Crystal create an excellent back and forth. The story builds to an exciting finale. The characters go through major emotional arcs. And the whole thing has a delightful sense of humor to it.

There are a couple of character moments that feel a bit forced. But overall, this is a great movie for people of all ages. My only other complaint is the name. ""Monsters INC"". Would that be like calling a company here ""Human INC""? Do they see themselves as ""monsters""? The monsters were just the friends we made along the way.",4,5

Rotten Tomatoes,Len P,Shadow In The Cloud,"Wish I could score it “0”.  One of the most annoying and ridiculous movies I have viewed in a long time.  How the f__k has Rotten Tomatoes reviewers given this 77% !!  The first 5 reviews I read, didn’t seem to be heading to that score.  Maybe it is so bad it has become some sort of cult classic ?  The audience score is more indicative except I think it should be 10%, not 32% !  Wish I’d realised there were 585 Audience reviews.  You only get that many when there are a lot of annoyed viewers.

Crawling across the underside of the fuselage and wing at 160 kts, then hanging on by one hand while retrieving a largish package (baby in a casket) then crawling back ….  ridiculous.  Getting blown back thru a 1 metre hole in the belly of an aircraft from 500m below …. at 160 kts … ridiculous !!  Rolling into inverted flight at low altitude to maintain altitude, then rolling back at wingtip height to land …. In a heavy bomber …. ridiculous (using “full rudder” … also ridiculous).  I don’t care if my comments are spoilers because it’s just so ridiculous, I just want to prevent anyone else wasting 83 minutes of their life.  A low low budget F grade movie mostly for the sake of one actress.  Her acting is good, but the rest is absolute rubbish.  If you’re an aviation enthusiast … avoid …. It’ll annoy the crap out of you.  If you want to watch a WW2 period piece … avoid …. It’ll annoy the crap out of you.
Netflix promotes this as a “Military, Action, Horror” move but it is a poor attempt at a “Flying High” spoof version of an USAAF B17 mission … with a touch of “Twilight Zone.",0.5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Chris M,Shadow In The Cloud,"This movie is HORRIBLE!! From the UNBELIEVABLE feats this woman did, to the HORRIBLE story, to a HORRIBLE PLOT TWIST, unrealistic...... 

YO, I laughed so hard at how UTTERLY BAD this movie is, because it stressed me out SO BAD. Never have I saw a baby tucked away in a pocketbook, go through SO MUCH in 5 minutes, cried for all of 30 seconds, get thrown around, flipped inside/upside down, and come out all of that unscathed COMPLETELY!! And let's not talk about the Gremlin she beat up BY HAND, meanwhile, we watched this same gremlin destroy a plane from the outside, in.

This movie is BAD🤣🤣🤣🤣",0.5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,O z,Shadow In The Cloud,"I couldn't enjoy it honestly, too much was going on. The stunts were so dramatic and the cgi was embarrassing.

 The storyline was quite literally all over the place. Pick a plot point and stick to it.

Also, this is might just me being overly critical but it erked me that throughout the movie, everyone else gets hurt, bloody and dirty but the MC is always spotless except for a cut on her cheek and arm.

Lastly, the music was just not matching the vibes of the movie at all. It threw me off the entire time.",0.5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Julie E,Shadow In The Cloud,"After reading that Chloe Grace Moretz was in it, and the fact that it was a horror film, I gave it a whirl.  It was so 'bad' that it was good, if that makes any sense. One of the most crazy, unusual films I've ever seen. What with the random vampire-like creature thrown in and everything else that happened, it was a rollercoaster of a ride.",4,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Paul G,Shadow In The Cloud,"A surprisingly fun film. It seemed low budget but the story-line was very watchable and Chloe Moretz holds the film together with some great acting.  Not much of a horror, or a war film, more of tame-horror-action-suspense film i guess.",3.5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Gothicus F,Shadow In The Cloud,"A movie with a great premise and very atmospheric start that built great tension… and then it nose dived in the second half into a steaming pile of wreckage.

Honestly it feels like they swapped directors halfway through and they thought they were making a bad slapstick comedy rather than a tense horror",1,5

I was totally and completely surprised by the fun and interesting action! Were some hard to believe? Sure, but that's what a fun, fast-paced movie like this is supposed to have. I love the time setting, and the graphics that made it come alive. 

Chloe Grace Moretz truly surprised me with a solid, nuanced performance with just enough humor to bind it together. 

It didn't have to hit you over the head with it's ore surreal moments. It almost had a Twilight Zone feel to it. Loved every minute. And some semi-social commentary to boot.",5,5

Rotten Tomatoes,Robert B,Kingdom Of The Planet Of The Apes,"Great restart after the terrific reboot trilogy. Instead of trying to fill the void of not having Caesar in the film, the film embraces the absence with a slow but deliberate (and sometimes frustrating) pace, and presents us with heartbreaking revelations that Caesar’s wisdom seems to have either been lost and forgotten or twisted and warped, much like our religion can seem to us all too often. A reluctant ape hero slowly emerges over the course of the film, and when the familiar crucifixes appear and the first notes of the 1968 original score echo from the surround sound, I knew I wouldn’t regret following his journey. Plenty of Easter eggs from the original movies abound, along with a surprise at the end that a reluctant hero on the human side has had her own agenda all along, making this a satisfying jumping off point for what should be a compelling story arc.",4.5,5

KOTPOTA 2024 was such a derivative bore, a Disney matinée at best, and an unecessary installment missing the aura and fear invoking drama of the originals, yet RT critics give it an 80%? Digital visuals were fine and obviously leagues beyond the 1968 costumes, but that's it. PG13 shouldn't mean Pathetically Gaging. As Wayne from Letterkenny would say: ""take 25% off that now"".",2,5

Rotten Tomatoes,Jay W,Wreck It Ralph,"2012 is a year where Pixar and Disney seemed to switch scripts. Pixar made the princess movie, and Disney made the movie about the emotions of inanimate objects. Along with Pixar's typical M. O., this Disney movie also holds a lot Pixar's trademark quality. This movie marked the beginning of a new bright age of animation for the studio. This was the first time they had Alan Tudyk provide his voice talent, a tradition they would hold for 10 more animated films. On that topic, the voice acting throughout the film is very good. John C. Riley, Jack McBrayer, Sarah Silverman and Jane Lynch are all perfectly casted, matching the voice with the character.

All the technical stuff of animation, voice acting, and music is well done. But what puts this film above the rest are the characters and story. This is a clever story with unique world building. They do a good job of introducing the rules of this world without it feeling like exposition. It has good twists, pacing, subplots and ratcheting up of tension. Ralph is a good relatable protagonist. As a viewer, you relate to his blight and sympathize with him.

Directed by Greg Tiernan and Conrad Vernon, the movie pushes boundaries with its crude humor, outrageous gags, and social commentary about life, religion, and the human experience. While it’s visually creative and full of shock value, the humor is often very over-the-top, and the constant reliance on shock tactics may turn some viewers off.

Rotten Tomatoes,D Jay Cee M,Sausage Party,"Review of ""Sausage Party"": A Culinary Catastrophe

""Sausage Party"" is a film that proudly boasts its status as an animated adult comedy, but it delivers little more than a relentless barrage of crude humor and gratuitous gross-out moments that leave viewers questioning not just the film’s creativity, but the very tastefulness of its existence. 

At its core, the film’s script resembles a disjointed food fight, where characters flail about, spouting shock value lines instead of constructing a cohesive narrative. The plot, ostensibly revolving around the existential crisis of grocery items that yearn to escape the confines of the supermarket and discover the truth about the outside world, quickly devolves into a series of nauseating gags and tasteless antics that serve no purpose beyond shock and disgust. 

What could have been a clever commentary on consumerism or the human condition is lost in a sea of tiresome one-liners and relentless expletives. The screenwriters appear more focused on pushing the limits of vulgarity than on writing dialogue or a storyline that resonates. Scenes designed to elicit laughter often fall flat, tinged more with discomfort than amusement. As characters fling themselves into absurd scenarios, it feels less like a comedic exploration and more like a desperate ploy for attention through sheer nastiness. 

With such a unique premise, one would hope for insightful satire or clever wit, but instead, we are met with a repetitive cycle of gross-out humor that feels like a stale fast-food platter served with a side of shame. Each twist and turn feels forced, as if the writers, perhaps contending with the limitations of their own creativity, resorted to a gratuitous reliance on shock value to mask a fundamentally hollow story. 

The animation, while visually vibrant, cannot rescue the film from the mire of its own poor storytelling choices. What unfolds is a lackluster experience where even the most vibrant characters—often based on food, a smart choice for visual appeal—fail to develop in any meaningful way. Instead, they are mere puppets to a script that meanders aimlessly while assaulting viewers with debased imagery.

In conclusion, ""Sausage Party"" is a tedious exercise in excess that revels in its own filth to the point of absurdity. It’s an unfortunate reminder that grasping for shock factor often comes at the expense of genuine humor and narrative cohesion. Rather than a whimsical exploration of food’s place in our lives, we’re served a rancid platter of cliches and distaste that ultimately leaves a bad taste long after the credits roll. Save yourself the trouble and skip this film—your palate and your sanity will thank you.",0.5,5

Rotten Tomatoes,Matthew D,1066050-Party Girl,"Parker Posey astonishes with her hilariously quirky humor and lovable personality.

Director Daisy von Scherler Mayer's romantic screwball comedy Party Girl (1995) is a bizarre time capsule of the 90's with erratic characters, offbeat humor, funny references, and a unique style all its own. I adored Parker Posey as the down on her luck heroine Mary. Party Girl feels like a riff on Audrey Hepburn's Breakfast at Tiffany's meets a Cary Grant screwball comedy. I can see Party Girl having an influence on later comedies like Romy and Michele's High School Reunion, Legally Blonde, or Uptown Girls. Party Girl is playful with a 90's charm and chaos from the killer dance music soundtrack to the mesmerizing mismatched clothes that are to die for on Parker Posey.

Writers Daisy von Scherler Mayer, Harry Birckmayer, and Sheila Gaffney write a cute romantic comedy relationship, dumb girl proves she's a smart and capable young lady narrative, and tons of fun side stories for the supporting cast. Party Girl should be seen for Parker Posey, but she's also delivering these crazy written lines that are clever, hip, and refreshingly manic. They both praise the efficiency and mock the sexist intentions and simplicity of the Dewey Decimal System. I like how they use it as an organizational tool, comedy gag, and a metric for how disorganized Mary's life is in the beginning to how she matures currently in the end.

Casting director Caroline Sinclair did a great job getting Parker Posey as Party Girl's lovable lead actress and finding playful guys in the supporting cast. I appreciate how diverse the cast is too with white, black, hispanic, and arabic actors and actresses throughout Party Girl.

Parker Posey is a scream as the broke socialite as aspiring fashion designer Mary, forced to be a librarian for cash, until she realizes that's what she wants. She feels earnest in her quest for a serious and satisfying career, while also seeking passionate love and understanding. Parker is so strange, but I really love her bubbly personality, weird line delivery, and sweet sincerity. She delivers hilarious sarcastic comments, crazy singing, playful dancing, flirty one liners. Posey is one of my all time favorite actresses. Parker Posey and Reese Witherspoon are the funniest actresses of the 1990's, so it's a sheer delight to see her be a funny lead heroine in her own screwball romantic comedy. Parker is simply drop dead gorgeous, adorably cute, fashionable, and hysterical in Party Girl.

Anthony DeSando is hilarious as Mary's sarcastic gay clothes designer friend Derrick. Guillermo Díaz is a riot as the sympathetic DJ Leo. His crazed searching for vinyl and desperately seeking a club gig is fun like his flirting with Nicole Bobbitt's pretty dancer Venus. Donna Mitchell's alcoholic club owner and Motorhead fan Rene is a real scene stealer. Liev Schreiber is excellent as the pathetic English loser Nigel, who is both a bartender and bouncer for Rene's happening club. He's such a creep.

Omar Townsend is super endearing as the sincere romantic hero Mustafa. His falafel vendor and aspiring teacher make for an unusual and original romantic comedy partner for Parker Posey's quirky Mary. Sasha von Scherler is great as the mean and judgmental librarian Judy Lindendorf. Her dismissive godmother to Mary is a neat foil for Parker to bounce Mary's frustrations out on in Party Girl. Becky Mode is another fun foil as Ann. I liked Simon Verhoeven's appearance as Kurt too. All the other dancers are fun to watch in the clubs with their spirited dancing.

Editor Cara Silverman does a great job with providing a brisk pace and tight cut for Party Girl's slick 94 minutes. She does not waste a moment getting to the next oddball joke or cute romantic encounter. She'll slickly splice together dance montages, furious asides for Mary's frustrations, playful flirting, to Mary's fervent book sorting in the library. Cinematographer Michael Slovis gets really creative with his spinning and panning shots. His close-ups on Parker are lovely and captivating, but I kept getting surprised by his inventive camera perspectives and movements throughout Party Girl. It's quite well shot.

Production designer Kevin Thompson's spacious apartments, square library, and dingey nightclubs make New York come alive with a 90's flair. Set decorator Jennifer Baime's colorful set decoration leaves records, philosophy books, and designer clothes everywhere. Composer Anton Sanko's music is perky with lively music for each scene. I really was pleased with the eclectic 90s dance soundtrack. It's such an accurate time capsule for the mid 90's popular songs you'd actually hear in a dance club then. I screamed with joy when Deee-Lite started playing during Leo's DJ set!

Costume designer Michael Clancy's outrageous outfits for Parker Posey are practically a character in Party Girl. Every shot of Parker sees her in a new colorful, mismatched ensemble of designer shirts and dresses. Parker's long brunette bangs and straight black hair looks amazing. She makes for a chic librarian by the end.

In all, Party Girl is a vivacious comedy and sweet romance story led by a bubbly Parker Posey in a magnetic heroine performance!",5,5

Parker Posey is obviously the film's main highlight.",2.5,5

Rotten Tomatoes, ,1066050-Party Girl,"Parker Posey stars as an all-nighter, Mary in the big city but her life seems to be going nowhere for the most part 
because of a recent rave she hosts Mary ends up getting arrested and must find a way to pay for her income as well as her lifestyle
she decides to get a job as a librarian and prove she can actually make something for herself
Omar Townsend plays a charming Lebanon food vendor who takes quite the liking towards her, being a teacher he can't go any further 
Mary's life pretty much plays out like a library of books that's out of order; if it isn't organized the system falls apart as does everything around her 
Maybe working as a librarian will help run some of the intelligent literacy Mary desperately needs, she's so worried she's not qualified for anything she may end up like her mother 
Even her Aunt Judy nudges her to absorb some education to stop ruining her life filled with mistakes and excessive partying 
It's only after Mary gets a taste of reality she switches from the all-nighters to focusing on acquiring life skills 
Yes we can stay out all night but sooner or later we have to set goals for ourselves down the line, life can still be a party as long as we can still teach ourselves what others can teach, most librarians who are women have fought long and hard to make the establishment organized but also accessible to everyone willing to learn 
This is Parker Posey's movie truly being an inspiration for any young woman or person to be something wanting to not be lost in life 
She is a diva but also somebody not completely devoid of capable thought and higher-learning
It's hip, sexy, filled with rocking beats of the era, and has a lesson of books opening up our minds to passions and dreams that would rarely come to us on our own 
Posey is a lot of fun and so full of energy in this early indie flick",4,5

Rotten Tomatoes, ,1066050-Party Girl,"A quirky, inventive comedy, that comes off as sincere and lovable, as the lead character. Parker Posey ruled the indie films of the nineties, starring in 32 indie films throughout the decade and gaining the nickname ""Queen of the Indies."" She earns that moniker as the misadjusted misanthropic Gen X party girl Mary. The film starts with a party scene in a New York loft, occupied by all manner of outcasts, including drag queens, bare chested men and glitter covered twentysomethings. The film itself is a look at that generation, at being lost, without a job or a purpose when the world is waiting with an outstretched hand. Mary is a party girl, but not a dolt headed nymphet. She makes money in the beginning of the film running a business, a business based on gluttony and freedom, partying away the shame and indulgences of youth. The film distances itself from that lifestyle, and shows that you can love the world of parties and clubs while reaching a goal for the rest of your life. Mary is neither empty headed nor inherently unambitious, and as she interacts with the different people of her life, (everyone from the New York City public librarians, friends, club promoters, and a food truck vendor) we realize she is multi-faceted. The film reeks of indie in the best possible way. The music is nineties' club music the entire way through, the film itself has nice long shots, no quick cuts, and manages to bring each relationship into focus. This film cemented Parker Posey as the ""it girl"" of the era and led to a short lived sitcom on Fox. Mary is a candid and earnest character, and simply watching her shift between intense intellectual prowess and party girl proves to be the main interest of the film. Simply one of the best indies of the decade, with one of the best actresses in the lead role.",4,5

While it may not be a top-tier cinematic masterpiece, it certainly provided fans with a satisfying glimpse into the world of Mortal Kombat and its iconic characters.

I understand that the film has faced significant criticism from both critics and fans alike, mainly because it didn't fully capture the essence of the source material that many were hoping for. However, I believe it was decent enough not to deserve a negative rating. It does a fair job of embodying the spirit of ""Mortal Kombat,"" and while some characters could have been better developed, the franchise has since moved forward with newer iterations that have offered more depth and credibility to its characters.

Rotten Tomatoes,Ads T,Et The Extraterrestrial,"As a kid, I loved E.T. I had posters, a wind-up toy, the storybook. There was something really endearing about that family friendly alien- despite what he looked like! ( I read somewhere that Harrison Ford referred to the character as ‘that ugly fuck’).
The film was a magical study on childhood and as a 7 year old, I could totally relate to Elliot and his willingness to own E.T. as an almost exotic space pet.
20 years later, I took my girlfriend to watch the anniversary release of the film but as wonderful a film it was, I was probably too much of a cynical adult to truly enjoy it.
So when and where you were when you first saw this film is perhaps more suited to the spirit of movies in the late70s and early 80s.
Looking at the remastered treatment now, I am not sure which scenes of E.T. are CGI.
The film certainly weaves a spell and every scene is perfectly shot and performed.

Rotten Tomatoes,Mary B,Et The Extraterrestrial,"E.T. holds deep nostalgia for many people. It’s one of those rare films that perfectly captures the magic and wonder of childhood. The bond between Elliott and the alien, paired with a beautifully executed coming-of-age story, makes it both heartwarming and deeply emotional—a true tearjerker. Spielberg has a unique ability to evoke raw emotion through poignant, powerful scenes, and the soundtrack complements the film flawlessly. Anyone who trashes this movie clearly lacks an appreciation for great storytelling, and frankly, I question their emotional depth. It’s disappointing that the audience score is so low—some people just don’t recognize good cinema when they see it.",5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Cat M,Et The Extraterrestrial,"E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982) – A Timeless Masterpiece

Steven Spielberg’s E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial isn’t just one of the best sci-fi films ever made. It’s one of the most heartfelt and magical movies of all time. Blending adventure, emotion, and wonder, E.T. tells a story that goes beyond aliens and spaceships. At its core, it’s about friendship, love, and the longing for home, making it a film that resonates across generations.

From the very beginning, E.T. stands out because of its perspective. Instead of a traditional alien invasion story, it focuses on a lost, gentle creature and the young boy who finds him. Elliott, played beautifully by Henry Thomas, is a lonely kid struggling with his parents’ divorce. When he discovers E.T., their bond becomes more than just a boy-and-his-alien tale. It’s about two lost souls finding comfort in each other. Their friendship is pure, heartfelt, and incredibly moving, creating one of the most emotional connections in film history.

What makes E.T. even more special is how Spielberg tells the story. The film is shot mostly from a child’s point of view, making the world feel bigger, more mysterious, and full of wonder. The cinematography, combined with the warm lighting and Spielberg’s signature storytelling, creates an atmosphere that feels both nostalgic and timeless. Every frame is carefully crafted to draw audiences into the magic of childhood, where bicycles can fly and the impossible feels real.

Of course, E.T. wouldn’t be the same without its legendary score by John Williams. The music elevates every moment, from the quiet emotional scenes to the thrilling chase sequences. The soaring theme during the bike-flying scene is nothing short of iconic, making the audience feel the exhilaration and joy of that moment. Williams’ score doesn’t just complement the film. It defines it.

For 1982, the special effects were groundbreaking. E.T. himself, created with a mix of animatronics and puppetry, felt incredibly real. His expressive eyes, glowing heart, and small, gentle movements made him one of the most beloved creatures in cinema. Unlike many sci-fi movies of the era that relied on flashy effects, E.T. focused on emotional realism, making audiences believe in the alien’s existence on a deeper level.

Beyond its technical brilliance, E.T. carries a universal message of love, kindness, and the fear of saying goodbye. The film’s ending is one of the most emotional moments in cinematic history, reminding us that even when we part ways with the ones we love, they never truly leave us.

More than four decades later, E.T. still holds up as a masterpiece. It’s a film that transports viewers back to childhood, where adventure and wonder filled every corner of life. Whether you’re watching it for the first time or the hundredth, it has the same effect. It makes you believe in the magic of storytelling.",5,5

When it hit theatres, it struck audiences all over the world with amazement as they were taken on a roller coaster ride of emotions even though the extraterrestrial should not have been very relatable. Steven Spielberg managed to touch the heart strings of most with this one. He has made a lot of wonderful films that could be classified in several different genres.

Steven Spielberg masterfully crafted this film, infusing it with a sense of realism that makes ET feel like a genuine extraterrestrial searching for his family, rather than just a puppet or animated character. I truly felt a connection with ET, as if he were part of my own family.

The iconic moments, such as the famous bicycle ride and the heartfelt ""ET phone home"" scene, are etched in cinematic history, solidifying this film as one of the greatest masterpieces ever made. It’s the kind of movie you could watch on repeat, bringing a touch of classic Hollywood magic into your home.

Rotten Tomatoes,N P,Et The Extraterrestrial,"""E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial"" is a perfect film that naturally masters interweaving family, friendship and heart in a one of a kind tale. Being one of the highest grossing and beloved movies of all time, many films directly afterwards have tried to replicate the unlikely animatronic friend and children against the world theme, the current Stranger Things harkens much inspiration, and when we think of classic 80s childhood movies that will always have a special place in our hearts - E.T. will always be referenced to no one's chagrin. Music by John Williams is always immaculate and highly memorable, the direction and camera techniques is purposeful with great pacing, a full, well-rounded story and full of love and care, countless iconic moments that are eternally pop culture quotable and stamped in our consciousness, the child actors, specifically Elliot and his family, are relatable, adorable and get our emotions every single time, and E.T. himself is a wonder, and somehow, they made this piece of rubber and a somewhat mysterious alien figure (which to this point, otherworldly beings from outer space were seen as against human kind and downright terrifying), lovable and the heart and soul of this entire film - if the production didn't get this right to a T, this movie simply wouldn't work. E.T. is a downright classic, gets better with time and is a must-watch for anyone from any background and of all ages - teaching us the value of interacting with our surroundings and individuals with empathy, light and love, and keeping that inner-child alive, healthy and well",5,5

There were no spectacular special effects, only Douglas would likely have commanded a hefty salary and nothing I saw in advance of watching the movie led me to believe it was going to be so fantastic that it would make tons of money. It was very much the same flavor as The Glass House released only a few weeks prior which had just a little over half of the budget this one did. An IMDb trivia said they expensively recreated an NYC subway station in Toronto, but even that only cost them $150k... whatever. I was fine with the quite contrived plot in large part thanks to Bean and Murphy's performances as she really did a great job in this.",2.5,5

Rotten Tomatoes, ,Fifty Shades Of Grey,"At first I just wanted to watch this seemingly disgusting movie as a way to truly see just how horrible it is. I have to say it was worse than I had imagined. The plot covers a billionaire who meets a totally random college student who interviewed him and they share some “chemistry” which leads to eventual wierd sexual escapades. I have to say plot point number one id like to address is how absurd does that sound, a totally out of nowhere college girl who is just so random to me, which I do not think has any sexual appeal at all gets attached to a billionaire in two days… and the billionaire somehow is also into her? Wow. It’s honestly pretty self explanatory why the plot evidently sucks. point no 2 that’s id like to address is the chemistry between Ana and christian, to put it simply, it’s barely there. The atmosphere when these two main characters interact just seem tense and awkward and do not have an atmosphere I’d usually like to see between to lovers. I get it, it’s a “mature” movie but that doesn’t mean the characters shouldn’t have any chemistry. point no 3 not exactly a point but I’d just like to say that it is nothing short of a porn movie. The two characters are ugly and idiots and nobody in this movie can act. It’s all sex and wierd drama that is basically the equivalent of a pornography. No 4 it’s so wierd, it’s just so wierd. Anna’s a virgin college student. That’s so wierd

Rotten Tomatoes, ,Fifty Shades Of Grey,"I did not read the book, but I thought why not watching the movie, as it would be less tedious that reading a 400 or 500 pages book of erotism. As a man, I was quite shocked that the main actress looks kind of disgusting. No beauty, no feminine shape, no class in behaviour. Just a random girl who get suddenly spoiled way more than she deserves, for no reason.

I presume that's the point of the movie : to make feel that any woman can identify to this actress because she is totally random and no talent whatsoever about anything, so nothing makes her apart. 

But that is a very weak choice as most woman will not identify to her and most men will want to vomit if they identify to Mr Grey and see that he is so after her.

Also, one major mistake is to show someone who is supposed to be so dominant as someone weak, desperate and hopeless to get the girl. He certainly have thousands of better choices that this wooden plank.

The only good points are the main actor, good sceneries and the soundtrack. Those are nice, but it's a bit of a stretch to rely on for a full trilogy.",2,5

This is especially evident due to the lack of chemistry between the characters, which feels forced and artificial. Moreover, the overall structure of the movie is poorly crafted. However, I don’t hold the screenwriter solely responsible. She did the best she could with the author’s convoluted and incoherent writing.

Half a star for the pure laughter I got from making fun of this movie. If you like this movie, seek help. 

Bonus: They're both ugly. Oh. And there was zero sexual tension. Felt like two ugly awkward strangers. Can I just mention how she was a virgin? And never was into it but... moved in with him? And then had the audacity to complain about the contract every 5 seconds and pretend to be confused about what was going to happen? After 1 weekend? Kate? Shitty friend. 

Extra bonus: I cannot even fathom how much I hate this movie and these two characters. It was the longest two hours of my life (because I paused it every 1 second due to being buffalooed and gobsmacked). The directors, writers, and actors should be extremely embarrassed. I pray their children never find this monstrosity. Do I even want to know what happens in the sequel... and *gasp* TREQUEL??",0.5,5

Rotten Tomatoes,Gold S,Fifty Shades Of Grey,"I can’t say it’s the worst movie I’ve ever seen, but honestly, it felt like they should have put it on a site like Xvideos  or P.hub instead. A significant portion of the film focused on explicit scenes, with themes of humping and BDSM taking center stage rather than meaningful storytelling. Jamie Dornan undeniably embraced his role as a wealthy, enigmatic billionaire, but instead of channeling his fortune and charm into fighting crime like Bruce Wayne, he spent his energy exploring the darker corners of intimate relationships. While the cinematography and production value might appeal to some, the lack of depth in the plot makes it hard to take the movie seriously.",1.5,5

Rotten Tomatoes,Gabriel S,Bagman 2024,"Bagman falls short, it’s atmosphere asking for more but delivering little. The film had all elements at hand to shine as a monster-in-the-house entry: a well-known entity driving the story, strong cinematography elements demonstrating maturity in the crew, good actors, but somehow it just doesn’t work as a whole. Average like most B-horror movies.
The story follows father-of-a-3-year-old Patrick McKee, played by skinny-Henry-Cavill-lookalike Sam Claflin, who thinks his kid is being stalked by something lurking out of his childhood trauma. This father is desperate to protect his family. A chilling concept, overused but efficient.
The main problem with this film is that nothing gets a deep exploration, a shallow pool of facts that satisfactorily culminate in a strong ending, at least, but somewhat sour. Subplots have a weak development, either posing red herrings or MacGuffins, then, in the end, our character lead has injustice treatment. Fair to say, no one gets fair treatment here.
Protagonist Patrick McKee, Patty, is a good father and husband struggling with finances, leading to irritability and depression. But he is far from becoming yet another George Lutz, no, Patty is dedicated to protecting his family from whatever is chasing their son.
Our protag family, the McKees, also have caring mother Karina and son Jake. Karina is supportive and strong, and Jake is naïve as balls, too easy to fool, but he is 3 years old, even though the child actor feels a bit older, something I couldn’t confirm. 
Something is a bit off with this family and their relatives. One thing is that they leave Jake alone too often for a 3-year old. If something seems to have an interest on my daughter, I’d go full-protection mode in a second, man, won’t be fooling around leaving my daughter unattended, even inside the house, especially inside a house I feel is unsafe.
The second thing is that their relatives are some unsupportive people, for the most part. Patty has a brother, Liam, who owns a damn woodshop, seems to be doing way better financially, but I guess he is just too busy to care about his brother struggles; same for Anna, Karina’s sister, who happens to be wealthy enough, thank you very much, but again, why bother helping out a bro or a sis, right?
This seems to be the first major writing work of writer John Hulme — in fiction —, and I think he was able to maintain on par with expectations for a movie about the Bagman urban legend, but you see he was not able to develop some of the subplots. These minor plots feel, at best, exploitative, not diminishing, but just adding means to an, ugh, end that lacks proper closure. Pair that with Director Colm McCarthy, whose portfolio is strong on TV series and light on cinema flicks, and you get Bagman, somewhat ok for the genre.
The atmosphere could be creepier, but the rating definitely limited things. To keep the PG-13 rating, Director Colm McCarthy surely had to tone down some of the horror elements, so we get the abridged version where things are almost happening, but they never really do happen.
Missed potential, but entertaining for what it is, Bagman opens the door to a sequel, but who knows if it will ever be made. As a standalone, it barely scrapes the OK rating.",2,5

It's a good movie for those who appreciate a father making the ultimate sacrifices for the betterment of his child, but one that will leave you feeling a bit depressed by the lack of presence in that child's life that ultimately results from the conclusion of this film. It's a thrilling and scary story that has similar themes to IT and the Shining as well as Darkness Falls, and will definitely get you in the feelings when it comes to a precious child and the possibility of life loss and family separation.",4,5

Rotten Tomatoes,CS A,Good Shepherd,"This film delves into the profound depths a person is willing to plunge to avoid betraying their homeland, exploring the potential personal toll of such betrayal. Edward Wilson, driven by his predetermined destiny, prioritizes his allegiance to the country over love and family, a choice stemming not solely from personal experiences but also from the haunting legacy of his father's suicide at the age of six. Wilson Sr., burdened by the shame of betraying his country, chose a tragic end, which significantly influenced his son's path.
The protagonist's decision-making is further complicated by a letter from his father, left unread deliberately to emphasize that Wilson Jr. evolves independently of paternal guidance. Consequently, the ultimate choice between love, family, and country remains consistent throughout the movie.
""The Good Shepherd"" unfolds as a suspenseful narrative, with a mystery that intensifies as the storyline progresses. This structure mirrors the persistent questioning in Ayn Rand's ""Who is John Galt?"" from Atlas Shrugged, establishing a thematic parallel. The film tirelessly seeks to unravel the espionage enigma surrounding the investigated film obtained from a Russian Spy. As the puzzle pieces fall into place, the movie successfully answers the central question, providing a satisfying resolution.
In essence, ""The Good Shepherd"" is a brilliant exploration of the impact of leading an honorable, trustworthy life as a shepherd to one's nation, even if it comes at a considerable cost. The film prompts reflection on the sacrifices made by government agents who, despite meager financial rewards, scant recognition, and forsaking nearly everything, remain dedicated to their jobs and love of their country.
Besides the compelling question addressed in the film, the most crucial aspect for me is the creative manner in which the intricate conundrum is presented. ""The Good Shepherd"" skillfully weaves a narrative that captures the complexities of allegiance and betrayal and engages the audience through a thought-provoking and artfully executed exploration of loyalty, sacrifice, and the enduring impact of one's choices on both personal and national levels.",4.5,5

Directed by Robert De Niro (several cameo appearances as General Sullivan) this script is underperformed in many ways.  Matt Damon is so tightly wound as a character he's a stiff zombie in a suit. Angelina Jolie is a pretty dress that gets to emote twice in the film (yawn). Alec Baldwin, William Hurt and even Joe Pesci are rolled out in tiny cameo wooden stereotype roles too. Evil Russian spymaster entraps Damon's son too (really.., seen it..)  I can see why Hollywood LET the writers go on Strike!

Rotten Tomatoes,Jim M,Good Shepherd,"This was an interesting story with a great cast of characters about espionage and war, trust and deceit. If you expect to be entertained like you would with a James Bond or Mission Impossible film, you will quickly find an alternative. It was somewhat crushing to see Angelina Jolie emotionally destroyed after her dazzling start. Matt Damon seems unchanged and the same age throughout the imperceptible flashbacks spanning 30 years. So many other actors are given cameo appearances and quickly vanish. Ultimately, we are left with the emotionally guarded, near-mute performance of Matt Damon who wrecks his personal life by uninvolvement, and is rewarded professionally by being trusted to do more of the same work forever. The end is as dull as the beginning.",3,5
Rotten Tomatoes,jwcdood,Good Shepherd,"Those who liked THE GOOD SHEPARD liked it for the right reasons; those who didn't like it didn't like it also for the right reasons. The fact that it was a little too long and sometimes >felt< boring, was probably not a mistake in the screenplay or direction. TINKER, TAILOR, SOLDIER, SPY also took a very similar approach to a very realistically lifelike story about the utterly mundane horror of the world of espionage and the actuality of its inelegantly drab/mundane reality — all of which makes any realistic story or movie about anything whatsoever considerably difficult to sit through. In short? Dinero and the terrific cast, other than sets and costumes, didn't add any ""James Bond-esque glamor"" to the FUBARed reality of the filth necessary to attempt to stay ahead of a real enemy who is also making the very same to do the very same thing to you. THE GOOD SHEPARD is a superb movie in all respects [including authentic mundane reality]. I'll be watching it again to pick up some of the things that I probably missed. NOTE: If you're an action fan only? Stay as far away from THE GOOD SHEPARD as possible because you'll only end up whining about something that's not in your arena in the first place.",4,5

Rotten Tomatoes,Ola  G,Good Shepherd,"In 1961, the Bay of Pigs invasion ends disastrously. Senior CIA officer Edward Wilson (Matt Damon) is warned there are suspicions of a mole in his department. Returning home, he finds a photograph and audio recording of a man and woman in bed. However, the recording has been tampered with and certain details are unclear. In 1939, while attending Yale, Edward is invited to join the Skull and Bones fraternity. During his initiation, he reveals that he discovered but never read the suicide note left by his father Thomas, an admiral who was to be named Secretary of the Navy until his loyalties were questioned. FBI agent Sam Murach recruits Edward to expose his poetry professor Dr. Fredericks as a Nazi sympathizer, which leads to Fredericks' resignation. Edward begins dating a fellow Yale student named Laura, who is hearing impaired. After an announcement that World War II has begun, Laura asks Edward to sleep with her, but panics at the last moment. In 1940, Edward attends a party and meets Margaret ""Clover"" Russell, sister of fellow Bonesman John. He is also introduced to General Bill Sullivan, who tells him the US will soon be compelled to enter the war and offers Edward a job in foreign intelligence. Clover, whose father is a Senator and head of the isolationist America First Committee, is attracted to Edward and he eventually succumbs to her advances. While on a date with Laura at the beach, Edward is approached by John, who tells him Clover is pregnant and insinuates that Edward is obligated to marry her. Laura, reading their lips, walks away. On Edward and Clover's wedding day, he is presented with orders to leave for London. There he is reunited with Dr. Fredericks, in reality a British intelligence operative who had recommended Edward for counter-espionage training. Special Operations Executive officer Arch Cummings informs Edward that Fredericks' indiscreet liaisons pose a security risk. Fredericks refuses to retire quietly and is killed. In post-war Berlin, Edward collaborates with Soviet counterpart ""Ulysses"" in the exchange of captured scientists. During a call home, his son Edward Jr. inadvertently reveals that Clover is having an affair. Edward impulsively sleeps with his office's interpreter Hanna Schiller, but discovers she is a Soviet operative, leading to her murder. In 1946, Edward returns home to a distant Clover, who now goes by her birth name Margaret; they both admit to having had affairs, and she reveals that John was killed in the war. Edward is again approached by General Sullivan, this time to help create the CIA with colleague Richard Hayes, with Phillip Allen as director...

Rotten Tomatoes consensus states: ""Though ambitious and confidently directed by Robert De Niro, The Good Shepherd is ultimately a tedious drama that holds few surprises and succumbs to self-seriousness."" In her review for The New York Times, Manohla Dargis wrote, ""The Good Shepherd is an original story about the C.I.A., and for the filmmakers that story boils down to fathers who fail their sons, a suspect metaphor that here becomes all too ploddingly literal"", but praised De Niro's direction: ""Among the film's most striking visual tropes is the image of Wilson simply going to work in the capital alongside other similarly dressed men, a spectral army clutching briefcases and silently marching to uncertain victory"". Kenneth Turan, in his review for the Los Angeles Times, praised Matt Damon's performance: ""Damon, in his second major role of the year (after The Departed) once again demonstrates his ability to convey emotional reserves, to animate a character from the inside out and create a man we can sense has more of an interior life than he is willing to let on"". Time magazine's Richard Corliss also gave Damon a positive notice in his review: ""Damon is terrific in the role-all-knowing, never overtly expressing a feeling. Indeed, so is everyone else in this intricate, understated but ultimately devastating account of how secrets, when they are left to fester, can become an illness, dangerous to those who keep them, more so to nations that base their policies on them"". In his review for The New York Observer, Andrew Sarris wrote, ""Still, no previous American film has ventured into this still largely unknown territory with such authority and emotional detachment. For this reason alone, The Good Shepherd is must-see viewing"". USA Today gave the film three out of four stars and wrote, ""What makes the story work so powerfully is his focus on a multidimensional individual—Wilson—thereby creating a stirring personal tale about the inner workings of the clandestine government agency"". Entertainment Weekly gave the film a ""B"" rating and Lisa Schwarzbaum praised De Niro's direction and Damon's performance, noting the latter's maturation as an actor. Newsweek magazine's David Ansen wrote, ""For the film's mesmerizing first 50 minutes I thought De Niro might pull off the Godfather of spy movies ... Still, even if the movie's vast reach exceeds its grasp, it's a spellbinding history lesson"". However, Peter Travers of Rolling Stone magazine observed that, ""It's tough to slog through a movie that has no pulse"". In his review for the Chicago Sun-Times, Jim Emerson wrote, ""If you think George Tenet's Central Intelligence Agency was a disaster, wait until you see Robert De Niro's torpid, ineffectual movie about the history of the agency"". Peter Bradshaw in The Guardian gave the film two out of five stars and criticized Damon's performance: ""And why is Damon allowed to act in such a callow, boring way? As ever, he looks like he is playing Robin to some imaginary Batman at his side, like Jimmy Stewart and his invisible rabbit. His nasal, unobtrusive voice makes every line sound the same"". (Via Wikipedia)

""The Good Shepherd"" is as boring as watching paint dry. Too long and simply too tedious. I think Rotten Tomatoes consensus sums it up the best way by saying as mentioned above ""Though ambitious and confidently directed by Robert De Niro, The Good Shepherd is ultimately a tedious drama that holds few surprises and succumbs to self-seriousness.""",3,5

Rotten Tomatoes,Nawt W,Good Shepherd,"It's sure nice that this movie made the glowing-in-the-dark crowd scoff and recoil in anger that their profession was being portrayed as a cesspool occupied by borderline-souless sociopaths. That means that the story did something right. What this story didn't do was reach even a third of The Spy Who Came From The Cold's greatness. It has nothing to do with the fact that the former is a purely fictional story. You think this movie isn't fiction all throughout? Blaming the Bay of Pigs leak on one guy eavesdropping through a window? Really? 
Don't fear, because this movie is full of American ego stroking where they pretend that they are a true neutral arbiter of the playgrounds and that they would never overextend their hegemony. 
Despite being 3 hours long, this movie still feels incomplete. Probably because they wanted to make a sequel stretching to maybe the USSR's collapse. But it wasn't meant to be. The movie sure looks great. The costumes, the cinematography, set pieces, the constant shadow figures and the atmosphere. All top notch. 
Matt is the other thing completely. This wannabe Angleton misses the mark so hard. He barely emotes, yet is given a full dish of emotional family drama that you don't buy for a second. It is clear that he is supposed to feel distant towards them, but they just feel fake. It's the family of an actor who pretends like he's occupied by CIA duty, not an actual agent who sells his soul out for the good of the country. Choosing spy games over humanity.",3,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Damiano C,Good Shepherd,"It's understandable that Robert De Niro after years of being involuted in the movie business would sooner or later want to try directing a movie. Unfortunately, the result is a slow and ineffective film.

Robert De Niro's connections will surely have been a factor in assembling a prestigious cast, and some distinguished cameos prove it, some like Joe Pesci appearing for only a few seconds.

""The Good Shepherd"" is the story of how the U.S. CIA (Central Intelligence Agency) was born and developed from the end of World War II to the Cuban crisis, in fact ""Baia dei Porci"" appears among the events that of the film.

The story is told in a way that is not entirely linear, and some passages can be difficult to follow.

The film has excellent cinematography and is the only thing that prevented me from falling asleep during the viewing.

Matt Damon, in part because of the character he plays, emerges as a dim and one-expressed figure.

All in all, a mediocre film that is quickly forgotten.

Rotten Tomatoes,Ricardo B,Seven,"Eu tenho uma seleta lista de filmes que eu considero perfeitos. E esse é um deles. David Fincher é conhecido por ser um diretor profundamente sutil, detalhista e perfeccionista. E ""Seven: Os Sete Crimes Capitais"" é verdadeiro espetáculo do poder da narrativa visual. Eu já assisti esse filme incontáveis vezes, mas nunca deixo de me impressionar com o quanto Fincher é capaz de falar sem palavras, utilizando apenas a câmera e fazendo com que ângulos corretos, cortes precisos e close-ups nos momentos certos expressem, visualmente, tudo que o diretor quer dizer. Somando essa poderosa narrativa visual às exímias atuações de Morgan Freeman, Brad Pitt e Kevin Spacey, à assombrosa trilha sonora de Howard Shore e a um roteiro brilhantemente escrito, o resultado é — e eu digo isso sem a menor hesitação — um dos melhores, mais desoladores e sombrios filmes já feitos.",5,5

Rotten Tomatoes,jose s,Seven,"Se7en (Seven deadly sins) Movie Review 

Is Se7en the best movie in his genre? For me it probably is. Se7en is a thriller and crime movie with some horror elements. The movie grabs your attention since the first moment with those dark scenes in the place of the first victim of the killer, the movie is a suspense/horror journal that makes you wonder what is going to happen every moment because for me it was like that, you never know which is the next victim and who is the crazy killer, that is probably the only think you know for sure, he has to be a maniac because nobody else would do the things that he does to the victims, those were the words that I thought when I saw those horror scenes of the murder of the victims. While the history of the movie is good, the thing that makes it a great movie is the characters performance because they play a key role through the investigation maintaining the horror/suspense and they also make us engage even more with the movie thanks to their personal stories. 

With this being said, before talking about the principal elements of the movie and why those elements are good or bad for me. I need to say that if I were you, I would see the movie immediately because it is a great movie specially for those who love the crime/terror movies, believe me if you are on this type of audience you need to see this movie and after having watched this movie you probably gonna see it over and over again without getting bored. The movie offers you an ending, soundtrack, characters, suspense, horror, and story that is unique and I can only rate it as a 10 out of 10.  

Let's talk about the history and plot. Se7en is a dark crime thriller directed by David Fincher. It follows two detectives, the experienced William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) and the young, impulsive David Mills (Brad Pitt), as they hunt a serial killer who commits murders based on the seven deadly sins. The case begins with a man who was forced to eat until he died (Gluttony). As more victims appear each killed in a way that represents a different sin (Greed, Sloth, Lust, Pride) the detectives realize they are dealing with a highly intelligent murderer. The killer, John Doe (Kevin Spacey), unexpectedly surrenders but claims there are still two murders left. He takes the detectives to a remote location, where a delivery arrives, a box containing the severed head of Mills’ pregnant wife (Envy). Doe confesses he was jealous of Mills' life. Enraged, Mills shoots Doe, completing the final sin: Wrath. After having read this, you should be saying WOW and honestly, I am jealous because although I have seen the movie many times, I cannot feel that feeling of saying wow like the first time.  

The history and plot of this movie is great for me because Se7en is a gripping and disturbing film that explores the darkness in people and the idea of justice. The shocking ending makes it unforgettable, and the performances, writing, and atmosphere make it one of the best crime thrillers ever made.  

 

Suspense/horror: Se7en is a movie that keeps you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. The dark setting, constant rain, and music create a creepy feeling right away. Every time the detectives find a new murder, it gets more disturbing, making you nervous about what will happen next. One of the scariest parts is that the killer, John Doe, stays hidden for most of the movie. The detectives feel like they are always behind, and so does the audience. Each crime scene has strange clues, making you wonder what his next move will be.  

The biggest shock comes when Doe suddenly gives himself up. But instead of the story calming down, it gets even more intense. The final scene in the desert, where Mills opens the mysterious box, is one of the most unforgettable and shocking moments in movie history that I have seen. 

So, from my perspective this movie does a perfect job giving the audience that special feeling of being anxious and nervous about what will happen next, the movie takes us to a creepy feeling which almost horrifies us, and that feeling is very hard to get for most of the movies.",5,5

Rotten Tomatoes,Rowan C,Its A Wonderful Life,"The reason why this rating is not higher is because this is not my type of movie. I gave this a 7/10 because I appreciate it for what it is and this movie delivers a very good message that everyone should see at least once. George Bailey who is played by James Stewart was going through a rough patch and he ends up learning a very valuable lesson at the end. There is an angel called Clarence who is played by Henry Travers who is sent to save a man named George Bailey. Clarence is shown Georges' story and Clarence ends up saving George from killing himself because he lost $8,000. George wished that he was never born and he was granted that wish. He realizes that life is not the same if he were not born and he wishes to be alive again which made him very happy. Clarence was promised to get his wings if he ended up saving George and that is exaclty what happend when the bell rang at the end of the movie. George ended the movie with a beautiful wife and 4 happy children. Overall, I love the message this movie gives but it's just not my favorite Christmas movie.",3.5,5

Rotten Tomatoes,Martijn t,Its A Wonderful Life,"I finally succumbed to cultural imperialism and watched America's favourite Christmas film (Okay, a restored version was showing at the Filmmuseum.)

We're off to a rough start with folksy sentimental religiosity, weirdly sexualized children and some casual child abuse in just the first minutes.

But soon main character George Bailey grows up, so James Stewart can unleash his infinite charisma on us and Donna Reed, who manages to mostly keep up with him. And then there's the energy this film: nobody and nothing is ever standing still, there's always something happening or a joke being told. I am usually not interested in editors, but for this film I had to look them up. It's William Hornbeck and he is indeed considered one of the all time greats.

The ending with the angel worked a bit less for me. Henry Travers is funny as Clarence, but George turns annoyingly stupid suddenly and even James Stewart can't sell that.

Still even with its flaws, a film deserving of its reputation as a holiday classic. Still, as an avid watcher of urbanism YouTube videos, I couldn't help but notice this film's paradox: car-dependent suburbs like Bailey Park are what destroyed the vibrant communities in towns like Bedford Falls this movie celebrates.",3.5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Benjamin H,Its A Wonderful Life,"Beautiful, inspiring and packed with both emotion and thematic depth, It's a Wonderful Life is an excellently written film that really ponders on the wonders on life and why you should never give up, even though life can be challenging and sad.

Rotten Tomatoes,Dan  R,Its A Wonderful Life,"Considered one of the greatest films of all time, never mind Christmas films, 1946s 'It's A Wonderful Life' is what the word 'classic' was made for.

SYNOPSIS: 'An angel is sent from Heaven to help a desperately frustrated businessman by showing him what life would have been like if he had never existed.'

For me, 80% of this film doesn't take place at Christmas so I'm a little sketchy on whether it's really a Christmas film or not. Yes, the film's emotional conclusion does take place during the festive period, but still, it feels a push to call it a Christmas movie.

You can't fault the quality of the film though, with James Stewart absolutely at his best. A career highlight. Nearly 80 years on since its release, and as dated as it is, the film still packs the emotional impact it did back then.

It's one of those ageless movies, like 'Casablanca' or 'The Third Man', and somehow it feels like it improves with age.

A warm and comforting gem of a film.

Rotten Tomatoes, ,Pitch Perfect,"Aca-lute Cinema! One of the cursed consequences resulting from the success of “Glee”, this 2012 film has become the perfect time capsule of the eccentric cultural landscape of the early 2010s. An era that felt optimistic and open-minded for the time, while also being littered with “edgy”, offensive humor that was too often punching down on marginalized people. Faults aside, this remains a hilarious coming-of-age film for theater kids. It is hard to overstate the impact Anna Kendrick’s “Cup Song” had on society, making her performance in this film a cultural milestone. The supporting cast ranges from Broadway darlings to acclaimed songwriters, many of whom would go on to blow up during the decade.",4,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Lenny G,Pitch Perfect,"This film is literally a work of art i like that the movie is humoristic but serious at the same time. 
I really like the actress named Anna Kendrick she is really professional and really funny, there is also many actress like Brittany Snow, Rebel Wilson, Alexis Knapp, Anna Camp, Hana Mae Lee, Elizabeth Banks and many more.
The movie is directed by Mickey Rapkin he is a screenwriter, whose first book Pitch Perfect inspired the hit films series about a cappella singing.
The first movie of this trilogy released on 2012.
The main character, Anna Kendrick going to join the Bella’s of a cappella singing group, the group is only composed by girls who participle in tournament at her’s school. 
The main character as a really pretty voice so she match with every girls in the group.
The camera angles are really good actually the lighting are really great when the Bella’s go on the scene. 
The costumes are really good too and very beautiful.
The soundtrack is really modern she’s sings songs that are actually in the time like Beyonce.
The movie message is that we can pass in a domain we don’t know and we can make friends.
The message is passed very good and the actresses are really convincing. 
The story is really believable we can see a really good harmony between the actresses and her voices.
There really 3 of the pitch perfect movies all the movie is really incredible and the story follow the beginning of the story.

Rotten Tomatoes,Lola O,Pitch Perfect,"After over a decade, Pitch Perfect still hits me like the first time I watched it. I've watched the entire trilogy more times than i can count and its message still brings me hope in a reality thats dim. Pitch Perfect (2012) is about a young adult named Beca (Anna Kendrick) who is reluctantly forced to enroll in university, as opposed to traveling to Los Angeles to pursue her dreams of becoming a DJ. Beca is an introvert and mistrustful of people due to her parents' separation. Beca eventually joins the Barden Bellas, an all-female a capella group led by Aubrey (Anna Camp) and Chloe (Brittany Snow) on their journey to the a capella championship. Along the way, Beca has to navigate her relationship with romantic interest Jesse (Skylar Astin) and the Bellas: Fat Amy (Rebel Wilson), Stacie (Alexis Knapp), Cynthia Rose (Esther Dean), Lily (Hana Mae Lee). Did i mention the songs are aca-awesome? Perhaps its because the characters are so relatable, or mayhaps its because I enjoyed the pitting of an all female acapella group against an all male acapella group, or maybe its a combination of both reasons. Regardless, Pitch Perfect is a hopeful movie for young-adult females and as the target audience, I will continue to watch it.",4,5

Gruesome, pulpish material was transformed by dedicated participants on all levels of production, and a film that would have failed in the hands of many others wound up becoming a modern masterpiece. Taut direction and a superb screenplay might be the best arguments for the film's power, but the flashiest are certainly delivered in the bravura performances of Hopkins and Foster. Their interplay -- and remember, they only share a handful of scenes together -- is nothing short of riveting.",5,5

Rotten Tomatoes,Frans B,Silence Of The Lambs,"Will always remain one of the greats. Hopkins and Foster shines properly in character here. Directing is first class. Gripping and always shifting between the dark and light, doubt and facts, bizarre and sense, psycho and insane logic. Intelligent and intriguing. Absolute benchmark classic",5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,william s,Silence Of The Lambs,"A masterclass in filmmaking. The script is tight and evocative, the acting is stellar, and the visuals are haunting and unforgettable. On top of it all, it manages to keep the runtime under two hours. While the subject matter might not be for everyone, there's nothing structurally or cinematically that keeps this from being a 5-star film. Foster and Hopkins deliver career-defining performances, elevating an already exceptional thriller into something timeless.",5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,AJ F,Silence Of The Lambs,"Excellent movie. Although I wouldn’t necessarily call it “horror,” it is a thriller with an intriguing storyline and well thought out / developed characters that keep you entertained throughout.

Rotten Tomatoes,João Victor M,Silence Of The Lambs,"When I first watched The Silence of the Lambs, I thought the focus would be solely on Hannibal Lecter. However, the film surprises by building a complex psychological thriller. The direction masterfully uses framing and cuts to intensify Hannibal’s intimidating presence, with Anthony Hopkins delivering a brilliant performance.

The character becomes even more intriguing as he displays a peculiar moral code, contrasting with his monstrous nature. The second act, though slower, maintains suspense with unexpected twists. The climax, where Clarice faces Buffalo Bill, is intense and highlights her courage.

With outstanding performances and a gripping narrative, The Silence of the Lambs is an impeccable psychological thriller that keeps the audience engaged from start to finish.",4,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Matt C,Silence Of The Lambs,"On recent rewatch it certainly looks old but really has lost little of its impact. Foster and Hopkins are of course brilliant. Hopkins’ Lecter is iconic but I think Foster’s performance is even better. She is utterly convincing as the vulnerable yet determined agent in training. The sense of tension and unease is apparent from the opening sequence. Tight closeups on faces, centered on characters eyes, are a key feature of the film and are used at odd moments creating a sense of distrust and uncertainty of motivations and perception. Let down only by a corny action sequence when Lecter escapes, this really is one of the best thrillers of all time.",4.5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Jess F,Silence Of The Lambs,"Brilliant Best Picture of 1991 that never gets old. ""The Silence of the Lambs"" deals with a young FBI cadet (Oscar-winner Jodie Foster) who is sent to interview a captured madman (Oscar-winner Anthony Hopkins in one of the greatest performances ever on the screen) to find out about a serial killer (Ted Levine) who is stripping the skin from his female victims after they die. The FBI has had no luck with the case and agent Scott Glenn tries to throw a curve-ball to Hopkins by sending Foster. Hopkins is a former doctor of Levine and holds the clues to capturing the unknown criminal. Needless to say the film takes many twists and turns, creating a suspenseful thriller that has no equal. At the heart of ""The Silence of the Lambs"" are the confrontations between Hopkins and Foster. They play a complicated chess match of words which results in some of the greatest footage ever captured for the cinema. Hopkins dominates in spite of the fact he has approximately 17 minutes of time in the film. This is a film that will wrap itself around you and you will likely never be able to shake some of the key elements you have seen in this amazing masterpiece.",5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Ralph R,Silence Of The Lambs,"The Silence of the Lambs is one of those movies that isn't just great-it's iconic. From the moment it starts, there's an unsettling tension that never lets up. The plot is masterfully structured, pulling you into a psychological game of cat and mouse that keeps you engaged the entire time. It's dark, intense, and layered with meaning, making it the kind of film that sticks with you long after the credits roll. This isn't a casual weekend watch but rather a cinematic experience that deserves full attention.

Jonathan Demme's directing is sharp and precise, keeping the story tight without any wasted moments. Every scene feels deliberate, building suspense in a way that's subtle yet incredibly effective. The cinematography plays a huge role in this, with its use of close-ups making the film feel personal and claustrophobic. There's an intimacy to the way characters are shot, pulling you into their headspace and making the psychological tension hit even harder.

The acting is what really elevates the movie to legendary status. Jodie Foster delivers an incredible performance, bringing both vulnerability and determination to her role. But it's Anthony Hopkins who steals the show, creating one of the most chilling yet mesmerizing characters in film history. His screen presence is magnetic, proving that sometimes, the scariest thing isn't loud or violent but calm, calculated, and intelligent. The script is airtight, filled with sharp dialogue that never feels forced. Every exchange has weight, and the conversations alone are enough to keep you on edge.

The score and sound design play a crucial role in building atmosphere. The music is haunting yet subtle, never overdoing it but always enhancing the unease. Silence is used just as effectively as sound, making certain moments feel even more intense. It's one of those films where everything, from the writing to the visuals to the performances comes together flawlessly. The Silence of the Lambs isn't just a must-watch. It's a masterpiece.",5,5

Rotten Tomatoes,Arsen H,Seven Samurai 1956,"Seven samurai isn’t peak fiction it’s not cinema in my eyes. It is probably the greatest story ever told in mankind. It’s crazy how they done all of this in a three hour and 26 minute movie Which only came out in 1954 and seeing what Japan has been made of with Godzilla minus one with only being a budget to like 10 to 15,000,000 comparing to movies in the US that budgets are a bunch of money when I mean that’s like 90 to 200 Million for Hollywood Put these Hollywood movies with a crazy amount of money for its budget or just completely waste of money. They don’t do good but for Japan for 10 to 15,000,000 budget movie Godzilla minus one managed to bomb in the box office in a good way it just shows that Japan isn’t Messing around The effect on these Japanese movies really shows that Japan has been getting higher and higher in the marketing campaign them better than America back to seven samurai with great special-effects. great story, emotional scenes amazing character all in one movie, not even a Trilogy All the stuff I just named is just in one movie either way it’s a great watch.

One of the 1st movie to use telephoto lens.

American westerns copied this to make the magnificent 7. Pixar for bugs life. Also a space movie, battle beyond the stars, the mandalorian s.1 ep4, Seven warriors, 7 swords, China gate.

The hidden fortress is also great ( basis for star war new hope). Yojimbi and sanjuro remade into Eastwood spaghetti westerns.

  Today I concluded my viewing of some of the greatest works of Japanese cinema, and I concluded by re-watching this masterpiece by Akira Kurosawa, which I consider to be the greatest Japanese work, the greatest samurai film in history, and the best Kurosawa film. I watched this film last year and it was a wonderful experience, but after re-watching and enjoying the film, I felt its greatness and beauty, and I must have  I pay tribute to the role of the legend Toshiro Mifune as Kikuchio, in which he embodied a fun but sad character and gave us the most beautiful sacrifices at the end of the film. In fact, all the acting crew excelled in their roles and each character had its own aesthetics. The film was a mixture of war, battles, poverty, wisdom, planning, romance, courage and comedy, which Toshiro Mifune created.  In general, the movie was legendary and one of the best movies in history, and the closing scene was perfect and what a great masterpiece",5,5

Let the movie draw emotions from the audience with good acting. I didn't cry once and was just waiting for the violin music to stop.

The D-Day landing sequence is a visceral experience, setting a high bar for war cinematography. Beyond this iconic scene, the film maintains its momentum, delivering compelling narratives and character development. Tom Hanks leads a stellar ensemble cast, including Edward Burns, Tom Sizemore, Vin Diesel, Adam Goldberg, Giovanni Ribisi, Jeremy Davies, Barry Pepper, Matt Damon, Dennis Farina, Ted Danson, Bryan Cranston, and Paul Giamatti - all deliver exceptional performances. While the opening and closing scenes featuring the elderly veteran at Normandy may feel somewhat sentimental and unnecessary, they do little to detract from the film's overall impact.

Rotten Tomatoes,Elvis D,Saving Private Ryan,"Después de Schindler's List y Empire Of The Sun, Steven Spielberg realizo otro retrato más de la Segunda Guerra Mundial que logra ser tan asombrosa y conmovedora como las dos películas anteriores. Spielberg es alguien que tiene bastante reconocimiento en el mundo de la ciencia ficción, pero su más grande habilidad es contar historias profundas con personajes muy humanos y eso logra conseguirlo por medio de cualquier género cinematográfico. En el caso del cine bélico, logra hacer eso mientras retrata las heridas que han dejado los horrores de la guerra.


Saving Private Ryan ya captura la atención del espectador desde el inicio con una impactante escena de combate. Esta escena ocupa más de los primeros 30 minutos de película y con eso ya logra hacer que el espectador se adentre en la historia. Tras esa tan efectiva introducción, la película sigue al Capitán Miller y su escuadrón en busca del soldado Ryan. Lo que vemos es una historia mucho más realista y dramática de los soldados en zona de guerra. Hay un buen equilibrio entre la acción y el drama haciendo que las secuencias de combate sean espectaculares y al mismo tiempo sienta bastante tensión al ver a los soldados en peligro. Las escenas de acción se sienten como situaciones peligrosas reales y bastante crudas. Recrean de manera adecuada las matanzas que se provocaban en medio del campo de batalla. Vemos como los cuerpos de los soldados son despedazados en las explosiones haciendo que los combates sean bastante crudos.


Las actuaciones son tan buenas que se puede ver reflejado la sensación de horror y miedo que sentían los soldados en una situación así. Además, cuando los soldados no están combatiendo, los vemos teniendo charlas que no parecen gran cosa, pero es para ver que los soldados son seres humanos con metas y esperanzas. La misión de rescate se da porque uno de los del alto mando se puso a reflexionar sobre lo que es que una madre pierda a todos sus hijos en la guerra. Mientras tres hermanos han muerto, salvar al cuarto hermano que aún podría seguir con vida es un acto humanitario que ofrece una pizca de esperanza de que algunos soldados podrán sobrevivir para volver a casa con sus familias. Un sueño que los mismos soldados tienen y eso está plasmado en la película. Incluso vemos que Ryan está dispuesto a luchar para asegurarse de que algunos de sus camaradas puedan volver a casa. Mientras hay soldados que luchan solo por cumplir órdenes, en esta película vemos que los soldados luchan por sus compañeros y por el deseo de que ellos sobrevivan. Las películas del cine bélico han ofrecido distintas facetas de la guerra y los soldados que participan en ella. Algunas de manera heroica, otras como un tormento que genera daños psicológicos y el resto enfocándose más en la humanidad de los soldados. Steven Spielberg había hecho enfoque en la humanidad de los soldados con esta película utilizando lo que él había hecho en sus películas bélicas anteriores. Además, conserva algunos elementos más comunes del cine bélico norteamericano como el patriotismo y el orgullo estadounidense o el heroísmo de un soldado al sacrificar su vida para salvar a otro.


Todo eso hace que esta sea una obra maestra del cine bélico al retratar tanto el dolor de los soldados como las brutales batallas con excelente precisión. No hay duda de que Saving Private Ryan es una de las mejores películas bélicas en la historia que ha logrado perdurar gracias a su buen argumento y efectos especiales. No hay que incluso olvidar que las técnicas de filmación para las escenas de combate influyeron en el cine bélico, el cine de acción y hasta el cine de superhéroes tiempo después de que la película se estrenara. Aunque tiene elementos ficticios y algunos errores históricos, eso no borra el hecho de que Saving Private Ryan es una gran película con una visión acertada sobre la guerra. Es ideal para saber que tan espantoso y doloroso ha sido luchar en la guerra. Mi calificación final para esta película es un 10/10.",5,5

Rotten Tomatoes, ,Saving Private Ryan,"First 20 minutes of film are some of the most real and brutal show of war, whole movie is amazing, it shows brutalites of war in most accurate way. Greatest war movie ever",5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Reed S,Saving Private Ryan,"Saving Private Ryan is an absolutely incredible war film that I watched for the first time last night, and I was blown away. From the intense and realistic 
D-Day invasion scene to the emotional journey of Captain Miller and his squad, this movie captures the brutality of war like few others. The cinematography and sound design make the battle sequences feel terrifyingly real, and Tom Hanks delivers a phenomenal performance, leading a stellar cast that brings authenticity to every moment. The action is gripping, and the story of risking everything to save one soldier is powerful.

However, the one thing I dislike about this movie is that, while it’s visually stunning and technically masterful, it doesn’t leave a lasting emotional impact. Other war films I’ve seen, like Hacksaw Ridge, made me truly reflect on the sacrifices of soldiers and changed the way I viewed war. Saving Private Ryan, while intense and well-made, didn’t give me that same emotional weight it felt more like a spectacle than a deeply moving experience.

That being said, this is still a must-watch for anyone who loves war films, history, or powerful storytelling. It’s an incredibly well-made movie that deserves its place as one of the best war films ever made.",3.5,5

They are showing mankind at their absolute worst and making the audience stare at it. It is unpleasant, it is the reality we all do our best to pretend it doesn't happen. They are important scenes, and powerful scenes that I won't forget despite how hard I may try. Let us move past those scenes and talk about the scenes I loved. It is the small moments of levity, finding humor in the darkness where this movie really shines. Despite its clear darkness, I end up thinking more about the positives.",4,5

We weave perfectly between Rocket & Ze who is one of the greatest villians I've ever seen. Truly despicable, disturbing, and you never know what is going to happen when he is on screen. This has so much commentary on the cycle of urban violence, poverty, and really immerses you in the world of crime. This makes even the most brutal 70's films wimper a bit with how unflinchingly violent and brutal some of the scenes in this are. This isn't for everyone despite how good it is. You need a strong stomach a bit. The best way I can describe this is it's a mixture of a Bronx's Tale, 70's style urban asetics, and Goodfellas combined in the setting of Rio. If you can stomach it defintely give this a watch.",5,5

Rotten Tomatoes,Anastazja C,City Of God,",,City of God” is a raw and visually stunning film that delves us into the violent favelas of Rio De Janeiro in the 1970s. This movie is a portrayal of gang warfare, poverty, and the constant struggle for survival, told through the eyes of a boy named Rocket. 
    The film’s brilliance lies in its realism. City of god doesn’t glamorize the brutality. Instead, it exposes the harsh reality and struggle of its characters, many of whom are just children who have to grow up in constant violence and crime. While watching it, we get to explore the city itself, and we can feel like a part of the community. Meirelles’ kinetic style keeps the energy high, mixing fast-paced editing, intimate camera work, and a non-linear narrative structure that heightens the tension and drama. It was shot on 16mm film stock, giving it the feel of a documentary even though it's a crime, drama movie. 
    Everything in that movie is interconnected; it works perfectly together, and without one aspect, it simply wouldn’t. The story is told directly, but we just simply know that there is way more happening there. The movie is a never-ending cycle. After the big collapse of Li’l Dice, Carrot, and the rest of the crime groups, another is being raised. The war is never over; no peace is ever found.
     The character development is compelling. Rocket, the protagonist, dreams of becoming a well-known photographer and escaping the life of crime that surrounds him. I believe we all want to be like him, an ordinary boy living in the second-biggest city in Brazil. He lives in peace in such a violent place. Rocket is on good terms with everyone there; he has no enemies. Even after his girlfriend chose his friend - Benny, over him, he was still hanging out with the newborn couple. On the other end, Li’l Zé, the terrifying gang leader whose need for power spirals into uncontrollable violence. He kills every single person who disagrees with him, even in a slight way. The contrast between the innocent journalist and the ruthless drug dealer shows the limited choices available in the City of God. The best thing about Rocket is the fact that he gets to escape the favelas. Many other individuals tried to do it, but it's not possible, the city can not be escaped. In the little boy's case, the city chose him to do it. It allowed him to get away from the violence by finding him a job in Rio de Janeiro’s newspaper. Nevertheless, every character is of the same importance. 
    The director's ability to connect the personal with the socio-political is remarkable. It highlights systemic issues such as poverty and corruption, showing how the government traps people in cycles of desperation. 
What makes City of God truly exceptional is the cast. Most of the actors are nonprofessionals. Many of them grew up in similar circumstances. Their performances are raw and authentic. The most important roles are played by Leonardo Firmino - Li’l Dice/Li’l Zé,  Wilson Rodrigues - Rocket, Phellipe Haagensen- Benny, and many more. The movie itself is directed by Fernando Meirellesa and Kátii Lund and is based on a novel written by Paulo Linsa. City of God is based on a true story. 
   In terms of cinematography, César Charlone’s work deserves praise. The vibrant color palette contrasts sharply with the bleakness of the setting, and the way the camera moves through the narrow streets immerses the viewer in the chaotic world of the slums. 
   City of God is a beautifully created film that sheds light on the dark corners of society often ignored by mainstream cinema. It's a human story about survival dreams and the harsh realities of growing up in a world where hope is a scarce commodity.",5,5

Michael Clarke Duncan, Tom Hanks, and Sam Rockwell each bring depth to their roles, making the film an emotionally gripping experience. The story is both compelling and deeply moving, evoking a range of heartfelt emotions that make it difficult to watch at times. While the film is undoubtedly one of the greats, its emotional weight may make it a one-time viewing experience for some. At its core, The Green Mile explores themes of justice, mercy, and the presence of evil in the world, offering a profound and almost divine encounter through John Coffey’s tragic yet miraculous journey. It’s a film that lingers in the mind long after the credits roll, a testament to its lasting impact as a cinematic work of art.",5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Josh A,Green Mile,"This movie was 3 hours long and every second was worth it. This is an absolutely brilliant movie in every way, shape and form. It's a tragic yet sweet tale of innocence and justice. Let's begin.

The story is well developed due to the runtime: a man on death row named John Coffey can make miracles happen. And also weird things happen on death row. It's slow but rewarding and tragic. John's execution is the climax of the tragedy, as he was completely innocent and yet got punished for someone else's crimes. There's a lot of parallels between John and Jesus as well: they both were able to perform miracles and died for the sins of others. It's great.

But the best part of this movie, by far, is the characters. You have Paul, the serious yet soft guard who supports John, Brutal who's less caring than Paul but still cares and Percy, the dick who just likes sex and violence. There's also John, the kind man who always wants to help people. The chemistry between the characters makes the movie as good as it is.

Overall, it's quite simply a masterpiece.",5,5

It somehow managed to perfectly balance the fantasy genre with the prison genre, without making it seem like one of those almost deliberately bad movies from the 1990s, seem ridiculous. Mind you, we couldn't expect anything less from the King of Horror himself.

As mentioned by a comment on YouTube I read once: We had an angel and the devil (John Coffey and Wild Bill) and the incarnations of good and evil (Paul Edgecomb and Percy Wetmore).

A father trying to protect his youn son from the horrors of the world, in the time period in which they live in. ""There was nothing beautiful about life during the holocaust"", are you stupid, its not life being beautiful during this time but the beauty of what life is, over coming challeneges and having hope and looking after those you love, that is what is beautful. ""I've seen films do a much better job of portraying the the Holocaust and this film is also so repeated, notning new"" are you dumb? There were thousnads of people in camps they all had a differetn story. This film gives you a new perspective of this war by focusing on this family.

The dialogue's clunky and the Hamilton/Furlong acting often comes across as embarassingly shrill and unintentionally silly.  At the same time however, stylistically, the T1000 stuff is just mesmerizing.  Best 'bad guy' work I can think of. Together with the rest of the cinematography, Boen's acting, Arnie stuff and occasional solid moments from the mom-n-son - the overall bar comes to be raised quite unexpectedly.  Ultimately however, without Patrick, all would be rather forgettable.  While with him, the film lives in my head rent free.  Over many decades now.",3,5

That was Kyle Reese's line. It was Terminator's line in the 2nd film.  It also had some of the most memorable special effects. One of the best sci-fi futuristic movies of all time. The Terminator franchise  I would definitely recommend watching the movies in order. The first 2 Terminator movies were without a doubt the best. The soundtrack to the movie even sounds futuristic. Or like something out of an '80s sci-fi game. The Terminator has enough action in it for even the most fickle moviegoer who constantly needs non-stop action from beginning to end of a movie.",5,5

Rotten Tomatoes, ,Stargate The Ark Of Truth,gorgeous movie that ends a bit weak for my taste (for a stargate movie you barely use the stargate. but the superstargate is quite cool for a planetary sized stargate) a good ending for a TV franchise. ended just when it started to overwelcome it stay on the television programming (it was becoming a bit dull out see creatures with the power of gods beeing defeated by silly ideas of silly humans) but still a good decent movie.,5,5

Rotten Tomatoes, ,Stargate The Ark Of Truth,"Ultimately a film better served after viewing the Stargate series. Even with the recap, the film jumps right by the plot and characters. Fortunately, the story, while murky, isn't too bad and the characters are decent enough. More generous to the fans of the series, but there's nothing wrong with that.",3,5
Rotten Tomatoes, ,Stargate The Ark Of Truth,"Stargate: The Ark of Truth is one and a half hour of great adventure and innovative action sequences that truly defines the series.

The movie starts where the series ended. We see the continuous threat of the Ori and SG-1: s attempts to stop them. The opening scene is great, unique and classic SG-1. The movie is overall very similar with the series and its positive aspects. Those are great action, fine CGI and some scenes of epicenes. The Ori is at the same time an awesome enemy, very similar with the Goa'uld. There's a lot going on at the same time and the action is as I said, awesome! The plot is great, but it got some weird plot-holes. Some of those are connected with some of the rules in the Stargate Universe (not the show ;)). They made the movie great, but forgot to think about the basic rules of the movie. The CGI is as I previously mentioned great, but it's a bit vague at some places. 
It's the same with the dialogs. This is an aspect both SG-1 and Atlantis is bad at. The dialogs are focused on us, the audience. When they try to explain thing they do it in a way that sounds too forced. It's so obvious sometimes. 

But the movie is still awesome. The actors are flawless, especially Michael Shanks, he was surprisingly great in this movie! The soundtrack is also as great as it should be. This is a great follow-up to the series, even if the ending could have been better.

Overall is this a great movie. But the dialogs are the biggest flaw. The focus lies on the action, rather than on the plot, could have been better. It might also have been a bit bigger, more epic! But it's still an awesome continuation of the Stargate saga!

8.8/10",4,5
Rotten Tomatoes, ,Stargate The Ark Of Truth,"The Ark of Truth is a movie truly made for fans of the series.  Casual fans might find themselves easily lost wondering where certain characters are, what's going on, who the bad guys are, etc.

The time-travel plot is slick, the DeLorean is iconic, and the ‘80s vibes hit like a clean hip check. Sure, some of the science is sketchy, but who cares? This one’s all about the ride. Classic comedy, action, and a soundtrack that slaps harder than a one-timer.

Rotten Tomatoes,John C,Back To The Future,"There are some films that are just timeless and everyone should watch (especially in today’s climate of remakes, reboots and reimaginings).  Basically, see it before it gets horribly remade with overblown computer effects and wafer-thin characters that you simply just don’t care about.  By now, you can probably already tell that I love this film and I’m effectively going to ‘gush’ about it, so if you just want to accept now that it’s a definite 10/10 you might as well stop reading now.  However, if you’re vaguely interested as to why I think it’s so – technically – perfect, then feel free to read on.

In case you’re one of the few people that have been living in 1955 all your life and have only just arrived in our year courtesy of a time machine, you may need to know that ‘Back to the Future’ is about time travelling.  Marty McFly, played by the ever youthful Michael J Fox, gets caught up in eccentric inventor, Doc Brown’s, latest scheme to build a time machine out of a DeLorean car.  Naturally, things don’t go smoothly as he inadvertently ends up in 1955 and accidentally interferes with the very moment his parents got together, therefore possibly preventing him from every being conceived.  If this wasn’t bad enough, he’s only got a one-shot chance at returning to his own time thanks to a lightning bolt due to power his time machine for the return trip.

I think what makes this film stand the tests of time is the fact that it is a true ‘family’ film.  Whereas most films which can be watched by children are largely aimed ONLY at them and force the adults to sit through it until it’s over, I can’t imagine anyone – male/female, young/old – not actually finding enjoyment out of this adventure.  It’s funny without ever being childish or vulgar, exciting without ever being over the top or unrealistic (if you’re willing to suspend your disbelief enough to believe that time travel is actually possible) and, of course, it contains some of the most memorable characters ever committed to film.  Naturally, our dashing young hero, Marty, is very easy to root for, however it’s his cranky old sidekick ‘Doc’, played perfectly by Christopher Lloyd who steals every scene and is the true joy to watch all the way through.  It’s also worth mentioning that Marty’s on-screen family also can hold their own, played different versions of themselves throughout the time periods, but special mention should go a character who should – by rights – be little more than a stereotypical bully, yet ‘Biff’ somehow becomes the clichéd bully that all other on-screen thugs aspire to be ever after.

If this film has a downside – and I’m only mentioning this because I can see that some people may have a problem with it these days (I didn’t and still don’t!) it’s that there are a few topics of humour that some people may find a little ‘edgy’ in today’s PC culture.  For some reason I get the feeling that today any ‘family’ movie may shy away from a mother inadvertently falling in love with her son, but it was the eighties and things were different then!

There aren’t many movies that still can bring a family together around the TV in the living room on Christmas Day, but this is still one of them.  If you haven’t already brought the entire trilogy on DVD, then watch it now and show your children.  It deserves to entertain future generations.  Yes, the following two ‘Back to the Future’ movies weren’t quite so well-received by the critics, but I think they’re great, too.",5,5

Rotten Tomatoes, ,Back To The Future,"Alright, boys, this one’s a beauty—Back to the Future is like a perfect tape-to-tape pass: fast, fun, and never gets old. Michael J. Fox (🇨🇦 legend!) absolutely dangles as Marty McFly, and Doc Brown? Buddy’s got more energy than a rookie in his first NHL game.
The time-travel plot is slick, the DeLorean is iconic, and the ‘80s vibes hit like a clean hip check. Sure, some of the science is sketchy, but who cares? This one’s all about the ride. Classic comedy, action, and a soundtrack that slaps harder than a one-timer.
Final verdict: 4 outta 5—pure entertainment and a total classic.

Rotten Tomatoes,John C,Back To The Future,"There are some films that are just timeless and everyone should watch (especially in today’s climate of remakes, reboots and reimaginings).  Basically, see it before it gets horribly remade with overblown computer effects and wafer-thin characters that you simply just don’t care about.  By now, you can probably already tell that I love this film and I’m effectively going to ‘gush’ about it, so if you just want to accept now that it’s a definite 10/10 you might as well stop reading now.  However, if you’re vaguely interested as to why I think it’s so – technically – perfect, then feel free to read on.

In case you’re one of the few people that have been living in 1955 all your life and have only just arrived in our year courtesy of a time machine, you may need to know that ‘Back to the Future’ is about time travelling.  Marty McFly, played by the ever youthful Michael J Fox, gets caught up in eccentric inventor, Doc Brown’s, latest scheme to build a time machine out of a DeLorean car.  Naturally, things don’t go smoothly as he inadvertently ends up in 1955 and accidentally interferes with the very moment his parents got together, therefore possibly preventing him from every being conceived.  If this wasn’t bad enough, he’s only got a one-shot chance at returning to his own time thanks to a lightning bolt due to power his time machine for the return trip.

I think what makes this film stand the tests of time is the fact that it is a true ‘family’ film.  Whereas most films which can be watched by children are largely aimed ONLY at them and force the adults to sit through it until it’s over, I can’t imagine anyone – male/female, young/old – not actually finding enjoyment out of this adventure.  It’s funny without ever being childish or vulgar, exciting without ever being over the top or unrealistic (if you’re willing to suspend your disbelief enough to believe that time travel is actually possible) and, of course, it contains some of the most memorable characters ever committed to film.  Naturally, our dashing young hero, Marty, is very easy to root for, however it’s his cranky old sidekick ‘Doc’, played perfectly by Christopher Lloyd who steals every scene and is the true joy to watch all the way through.  It’s also worth mentioning that Marty’s on-screen family also can hold their own, played different versions of themselves throughout the time periods, but special mention should go a character who should – by rights – be little more than a stereotypical bully, yet ‘Biff’ somehow becomes the clichéd bully that all other on-screen thugs aspire to be ever after.

If this film has a downside – and I’m only mentioning this because I can see that some people may have a problem with it these days (I didn’t and still don’t!) it’s that there are a few topics of humour that some people may find a little ‘edgy’ in today’s PC culture.  For some reason I get the feeling that today any ‘family’ movie may shy away from a mother inadvertently falling in love with her son, but it was the eighties and things were different then!

There aren’t many movies that still can bring a family together around the TV in the living room on Christmas Day, but this is still one of them.  If you haven’t already brought the entire trilogy on DVD, then watch it now and show your children.  It deserves to entertain future generations.  Yes, the following two ‘Back to the Future’ movies weren’t quite so well-received by the critics, but I think they’re great, too.",5,5

Rotten Tomatoes,Mich T,Pianist,"As someone who has seen nearly 1,000 films, This is one of the few I can say that have made me cry, but in a good way. True stories always hit you harder than fictional stories.

Directed by Roman Polanski and based on the true story of Wladyslaw Szpilman, a Polish-Jewish pianist who survived the horrors of World War II, the film is an unforgettable portrayal of human resilience in the face of unimaginable suffering.

The use of music throughout the film is also masterful, especially in moments when Szpilman's piano playing becomes his only form of survival. The music just brings out the viewer's emotions and feelings for the character, It makes me feel as if I'm there. While The Pianist is a difficult film to watch due to its subject matter, it is essential viewing for anyone interested in history or stories of personal triumph against overwhelming odds. The film's pacing is perfect, never feeling too slow or rushed, and Polanski's direction is flawless, bringing an authenticity to the film that few other World War II dramas achieve. Overall, The Pianist is a moving, heartbreaking, and ultimately uplifting story that stays with you long after the credits roll.",5,5

Brody's character gets saved by a Polish cop and then he's basically getting moved around by non-Jew Poles and trying to survive. You really see and feel the struggle he goes through. Sad film.

The fight scenes are life or death and you'll constantly be on edge hoping that our hero won't get slashed or stabbed by all the swords and spears swinging around. Russell Crowe did a phenomenal job conveying the heartbreak, anger, and courage of Maximus as it's impossible to not cheer for the guy after all that he went through. Joaquin Phoenix also did an amazing job with Commodus. I've never had seen a villain that boiled my blood so much and I was so happy when fell. The ending is bittersweet and a perfect ending to a movie. At the end of the day, it's not about whether we come out alive or not but if we find our peace at the end knowing that we did everything that we could to do. Because when death smiles at us all, all a man can do is smile back. ∞🤞",5,5

Rotten Tomatoes, ,Gladiator,"This FILM echoes in eternity...

EPIC - GRITTY - INSPIRING - MAGNIFICENT

Gladiator is every man's appropriate response to such loss. I'd wake up a gladiator too if I were Maximus.

The sheer scale of this film has me in awe. For 2000? Oh yeah. Production design is on another level... can we please make movies like this again??? The visual effects aren't my favorite though. The color grading for the afterlife sequences is too dull, and between the floating heads and the glitchy slow-motion shots feel cheesy, but it's not enough to derail the film. Apparently the Academy loved it though...

None of that pulls from the magnificent performances of the cast, notably Crowe. Just... wow. Seeing this, I understand where he pulls that stoic energy from for some of his other roles (Robin Hood, The Water Diviner, Man of Steel, Master and Commander). 

It's the story and script that are the muscle of this film (though it seems the Academy disagrees on this point as well...). A man... who has lost everything... wife, son, honor, status... and all so horrifically... tossed to the gladiators of Rome to be slaughtered for sport... and we are on the very EDGE of our seats to see... what does he do next? Will he give up? Will he give in to the overwhelming grief that even we can seem to taste... or will he rise up, in the face of every adversity... and fight the very emperor himself to regain his lost honor and restore justice to a corrupt nation? That is the story in every man, even at the simplest level. There is nothing more inspiring than that. 

The script sets up everything so well to come crashing down, slowly builds up again, sparks hope, then all is lost... creating the perfect conditions to forge a hero. Trust me. You'll understand when you see it. 

While being heavily masculine, it doesn't lose a single drop of emotion. It's a rollercoaster. Great lines bring some enthusiastic ""oh yeah!!!""-moments, while Maximus' loss stabs your heart strings, and victories throughout leave you cheering. 

Just for laughs...... I saw many other films before seeing Gladiator... so my initial reaction is through this lens: Dumbledore and Robin Hood try to overthrow the Joker as emperor of the Roman Empire.",5,5

This film is like a Roman feast—swords, sandals, and Russell Crowe dishing out a main course of ""ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED?!""First off, let’s dive into the action. The fight scenes are so electrifying  And those coliseum battles? Absolute perfection. It’s like WWE, but with more lions and fewer folding chairs. “strength and honor” motto is so motivating that I’ve started using it at the gym. The soundtrack? Hans Zimmer, you are a genius.

Rotten Tomatoes, ,Parasite 2019,"Hey, I just wanted to give you a heads-up that this review might contain some spoilers for the movie ""Parasite.""


         The movie starts with the story of the main character's family. They live in a small basement room and aren't very healthy. They make a living by folding pizza boxes, which isn't a very well-paying job.
         Their financial struggles are so big that they turn to public insecticides, administered via wifi, and have to use them inshared spaces.Money problems also mean that they can't go to college.But then, the protagonist meets someone who helps him and his family move in with a rich person.
         His initial job as an English tutor, where he gained his teaching credentials, was followed by his rise to a professional position as an art instructor, a role that also required him to get his teaching credentials, since his sister, who was also his art instructor, didn't have much money.Despite the lack of financial resources, the hero's creativity and methods won over the mother and child.It's heartwarming to see how he found his way to become a loving art instructor. Then, the father allowed him to become a driver, which he did with a clever plan.
         The film is full of moments that shed light on classism, like when the rich mother hits the car seat with her foot or when the rich father pretends to smell the hero's father.There's also a conversation between the rich husband and wife about the driver's body odor, drug trafficking, and underwear in the car that looks insulted. It all builds up to a point where the hero's father feels so insulted that he has to stab the rich father to death.


Thoughts from this movie
        In our world, people who don't have a lot of money often have to work really hard to take care of themselves. It's more important for them to think about themselves than to think about other people.
        Even when we plan everything life doesn't always go as we'd hoped, as the hero's father learned the hard way.
        It's important to see challenges as chances to grow, like when the hero decided to become a tutor in a rich
        family to boost his family's finances and used his cooking skills to help out.
        But, as we all know, being greedy can sometimes bring about our own downfall. And that's exactly what happened to the hero's family. Their greed and the actions that followed led to a heartbreaking outcome.

Overall of this movie
        This movie is a really great example of how different people's lives can be. It shows how the lower class and the upper class live, and how they feel about each other. It's a really interesting story that keeps you hooked for almost two hours. It's not a story with a lot of characters, but each character has their own interesting story and history. There are also clues throughout the movie that you have to look out for.",4,5

Rotten Tomatoes,Blu B,American Psycho,"All Time Classic. The music is excellent and so clever. It always relates to the actions in a scene and is super catchy as well really immersing you in the 80's era. The acting is excellent as well highlighted by Bale who gives the performance of a lifetime as Patrick. The satrical line delivery, dark humor, and truly self absorbed disturbing performance by Bale is amazing. Dafoe is excellent also along with a really good supporting cast. The cinemaotgraphy is excellent also with great direction, extremely memorable kills, disturbing and funny scenes all with a low budget feel. The editing is really good and excellent pacing. It's very obvious this is a satire but also a disturbing horror film as well. You laugh, you get creeped out, rinse and repeat. Patrick is almost impossible to turn away from because of the charisma he has and a truly fasinating train wreck to see unravel. The twist is really good too and really clever. There are clues hidden all thorughout the film looking back and makes perfect use of the comedic tone. While it can see like it has a bit of an episodic feel and a lot goes on it does a really good job linking things to other scenes loosely with one action linking to the next to set things up. It's a truly unique kind of horror comedy that relishes in it's dark disturbing setup. It's commentary may escape people and this probably requires multiple viewing to truly absorb everything but it's so well made and unique I can't imagine someone not be interested on some level with this. Everyone should give this a try once.",5,5

Rotten Tomatoes, ,The Lion King,"I have never in my life seen such an amazing animated film. From the absolutely breathtaking animation, spectacular story and character, one of the most iconic soundtracks in Disney's catalog, and by far the best score for a Disney Animated film, and it still holds up 30 years later.

Rotten Tomatoes,Luiz Eduardo R,The Lion King,"É indiscutível: O Rei Leão não é apenas a maior animação já feita pela Disney, mas também um dos marcos mais grandiosos da história do cinema. Desde sua abertura impactante – uma das cenas mais emblemáticas já concebidas – até o desfecho emocionante, cada quadro desta obra-prima tem propósito e significado.

A trilha sonora, com canções inesquecíveis de Elton John e Hans Zimmer, eleva a experiência a um nível transcendental, capturando a grandiosidade e a emoção da jornada de Simba. A animação 2D, com sua riqueza de detalhes e fluidez impressionante, representa o auge da técnica e da arte dentro do estúdio, entregando visuais que permanecem insuperáveis até hoje.

A narrativa equilibra perfeitamente aventura, drama e comédia, com coadjuvantes carismáticos como Timão e Pumba, que trazem leveza e humor sem jamais desviar a trama de sua profundidade emocional. O romance é desenvolvido com naturalidade e sensibilidade, enriquecendo ainda mais a jornada do protagonista.

Scar, um dos vilões mais brilhantemente escritos da Disney, combina astúcia, crueldade e presença magnética, tornando-se uma ameaça memorável. E Simba, com sua evolução impecavelmente construída, se solidifica como um dos heróis mais icônicos da animação.

Com um roteiro coeso, diálogos marcantes e uma execução visual e sonora impecável, O Rei Leão transcende a definição de filme infantil e se consolida como uma obra-prima cinematográfica atemporal. Simplesmente perfeito. Nota 10.",5,5

Rotten Tomatoes,Mr A,The Lion King,"I love this 🎥. First watched it when I was very little but didn't remember much of the 🎥 back then until I watched it again in third grade. The 🦁 King is one of the most memorable 🎥's I ever saw. I've heard the famous theory about this 🎥 and The Jungle 📘 being the same story. In my opinion, they're not exactly the same but there are similar aspects in both 🎥's. For Example, they're both animal stories animated by Walt Disney. In addition, they teach similar life lessons such as safety. Furthermore, characters from The Jungle 📘 and The 🦁 King have similar characteristics. For Example, Simba and Mowgli learn that safety is important and that means avoiding dangerous territory. In addition, Mufasa and Bagheera are very wise and know what's best for Simba and Mowgli. Finally, Scar and Shere Khan are both evil and menacing as they share similar goals such as killing the protagonists Simba and Mowgli. These facts prove the similarities between The 🦁 King and Jungle 📘 characters. However, there are differences between the two 🎥's. For Example, The Jungle 📘 has humans in it whereas The 🦁 King does not. In addition, The Jungle 📘 takes place in the Indian Jungles whereas 🦁 King takes place in the African Planes. Furthermore, Simba has a biological family whereas Mowgli was adopted by Wolves and then adopted by a family from a village across from the jungle called The Man Village. Therefore, Jungle 📘 and 🦁 King is not exactly the same story. Also, I'd like to say that Mufasa's the best father Simba could have. Mufasa is always ensuring Simba's safety and teaching him life lessons about being king. For Example, he teaches Simba that being king is not all about having everything one's way. Mufasa reminds me of my dad because they share similar characteristics. Simba became my favorite character because I have a stuffed Simba at my 🏡 since childhood. This 🎥 is a legend and always will be.",5,5

Rotten Tomatoes,Paul A,Grave Of The Fireflies,"This is a story that can probably only be told in animation, these children stand for all children.

Rotten Tomatoes,Blu B,Grave Of The Fireflies,All Time Classic. Candidate for the great animated film ever made and truly one of the saddest films ever made as well. It's gut wrenching and not in a way that tugs on the heart strings to make up for lack of substance or in a over the top way at all. It's funamentally excellent across the board. The score is so beautiful and sad and memorable. Choosing to start by showing the death of the brother sets the tone right from the start and yet despite knowing the outcome right from the start it doesn't dilute the story progression at all. The animation is so beautifully real and bleak. It looks depressing with it's color and subject matter but never lifeless or dull. We want these two to survive dedspite that. Truly a testament to sincere storytelling. I kind of see this as a coming of age story in a sense too mixed with war. But above all else no matter how bleak things are there is always hope for a better tomorrow. Everyone should give this a try once but be warned this truly is one of the toughest things for anyone to watch. For what it's worth if you can make it through this there isn't anything you can't.,5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Emma D,Grave Of The Fireflies,had such high expectations from high ratings and was extremely disappointed; the pacing of the movie was painfully slow and there is barely any character development at all. had to force myself to watch it till the end hoping it would live up to the reviews but it was so boring and lowkey a waste of time. i guess in a way it shows aspects of war however many parts of the movie could be executed in a better way. i was hoping to get a good cry (i cry in almost every movie) but did not shed one tear. only plus was the aesthetics and quality of animation considering it was produced in 1988.,0.5,5

Rotten Tomatoes,Intel M,Grave Of The Fireflies,Hands down one of if not THE saddest films I’ve ever watched. It not only displays the reality of war’s impact on the adolescent mind; it captures the fight or flight response of a big brother trying his best to take care of his sister by any means. They also do well with showcasing how the older brother’s pride was ultimately their downfall. Truly worth watching and keep a box of tissues handy.,5,5

Rotten Tomatoes,Jacob B,Departed,"I would go see Martin Scorsese direct traffic. So I’m not exactly impartial. However, I will admit that this film covers territory he and others have gone over before and done it better. The things that make this entry stand out are Jack Nicholson playing a character again and not playing Jack, Whalberg stealing the leads thunder and Scorsese directing a film about the mob that doesn’t constantly make us think of “Goodfellas” in some way. There are a few drawbacks such as the casting of DiCaprio who still looks like he hasn’t hit puberty and a few metaphors that we are not very subtly hit over the head with, but as a whole this is a good entry—not great—just good.",4,5

Rotten Tomatoes,Marsh X,Whiplash 2014,"Simmons did an amazing job at playing the role of an aggressive conductor, the way he shouted his lines struck fear into my soul thinking I was getting yelled at back in middle school again, the progression of Andrew becoming a better drummer is really well done and this is overall just a really good movie, I would even go as far to say that this in my tempo, highly recommend whether you’re a fan of drums or not.",4,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Noah J,Whiplash 2014,"Whiplash isn’t just a film—it’s a gut punch in 4/4 time.

From the first cymbal crash, Damien Chazelle’s breakout feature grabs you by the collar and doesn’t let go. It’s lean, electrifying, and ruthlessly intense—a psychological thriller disguised as a music drama. And at the center of it all? One of the most toxic, fascinating duos in modern cinema.

Miles Teller is raw and razor-sharp as Andrew, a jazz drumming prodigy obsessed with greatness. But it’s J.K. Simmons who detonates the screen. As Terence Fletcher, he’s not just a music instructor—he’s a demon in black, conducting cruelty like a symphony. Simmons’ Oscar win wasn’t just deserved—it felt inevitable.

The beauty of Whiplash lies in its contradictions. It’s about the cost of ambition, but it never tells you what side to root for. It makes you question the line between discipline and abuse, between excellence and self-destruction. There are no easy answers—just sweat, blood, and the constant ticking of a metronome that sounds more like a time bomb.

Chazelle’s direction is razor-focused. The editing? Cut like a drum solo—snappy, rhythmic, and always in control. And the final scene? One of the most exhilarating endings of the past decade. No dialogue, just drumming. And everything is said.

In 106 minutes, Whiplash delivers a cinematic crescendo that leaves you breathless.

Is it a cautionary tale or a triumph? That’s the genius of it. It’s both.",4,5

Rotten Tomatoes,Huub B,Whiplash 2014,Very good movie. How just drumming could be so exciting is crazy.,5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Phillip D,Whiplash 2014,"For me personally I don’t like verbal or physical abuse.  I usually try to avoid movies with a lot of it, ex. stuff like Room.  The movie itself however, is very good.

Damien Chazelle has some bangers.  I had no clue he wrote 10 Cloverfield Lane, and wouldn’t have guessed it.  But it is another captive/abusive type situation.  I’ll try La La Land.  Maybe that’ll cleanse the pallet.",3,5
Rotten Tomatoes, ,Whiplash 2014,I can drum better.,5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Rich S,Whiplash 2014,"Like the Jazz standard, ""Whiplash,"" the film's story is one of extremism to the point of exhaustion. Director/writer Damien Chazelle's film bangs the drums hard and fast to make a point. To many who have watched it, Whiplash is a thrilling ride into a world very few people know exists.

Whiplash won three Oscars -- for film editing and sound mixing -- with J.K. Simmons capturing the award for best supporting actor. Simmons and Miles Teller give devastating performances and, for that reason alone, Whiplash is a must-see movie.",4,5

Rotten Tomatoes,Kyte K,Whiplash 2014,"Whiplash, i first came across watching some snippets of just a few weeks ago. It had me thinking in the first half it's only just gonna be a really hyper-competitive, dramatic story around this one man named Neimen working his darnest damned best through his drumming in spite of JK just gattling bullets of insults at him and others, and then triumphing with success in the 'good ending' with his own fulfillment of career, or... taken tad bitterly, quit drumming, lives life with another purpose and get JK in big-bad trouble for causing all that pain to him. After watching the entirety of Whiplash today, i finally know what is the actual cost of trying, and constantly being a perfectionst.

See instead Battleship Potemkin from 1924 or so.",1,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Johnathon W,Harakiri,"Superb samurai film that ranks as one of the finest ever made, thanks to an excellent case and Masaki Kobayashi's excellent direction.  The cast is fantastic across the board, with Tatsuya Nakadai superb as the mysterious samurai wishing to commit harakiri, only for his true reason to be slowly revealed.

Rotten Tomatoes,Blu B,Harakiri,"Masterful filmmaking all around. The Citizen Kane inspired flashback storytelling, deep focus cinematography, and blakc and white asetics make this incredibly moody, riveting, and memorable. The sword fights at the end are incredibly memorable and so well done. The highlight is easily the fight in the field between the two. Incredible commentary on the value of life and the the serves as ""Unforgiven"" style deconstruction of the Samurai mythos simliar to the cowboy. Riveting character drama is what carries this as there is not much action at all but makes up for it with tons of substance. Everyone who is willing to give a foreign film a try should consider this as a candidate.",5,5

Rotten Tomatoes,Tom K,Harakiri,"For years, Seven Samurai has been just about my favorite film. Hara-Kiri is good enough to edge it out. I don't know how I missed it for so long.  Be aware though, that for a samurai film there aren't many duel or battle scenes (in case that's what you're expecting).",5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Christopher S,Harakiri,"I am not a connoisseur of Japanese cinema, but I have seen many Japanese films, particularly in the samurai genre. To this date, this one is my favorite. The intensity is unmatched, as is the psychological warfare between the Iyi clan and two ronin, a man and his son-in-law. Both come separately to Iyi in order to perform the rite of harakiri, but for distinct reasons. As these reasons unfold, the drama heightens and the action builds until the fantastic crescendo at the end. The film is rooted in historic realism, not fantasy, and is a critique on Japanese traditions, but is not bogged down by didactic dogma. It is also beautiful, with high contrast black and white, long continuous shots, and multiple views of the scenery. Certainly worthwhile.",5,5

Rotten Tomatoes,Yash B,Harakiri,"""Harakiri"" puts a lot of emphasis on the dramatic weight of its backstory, which makes the action sequences near the end of the film really engaging. I did feel this samurai story was more dialogue-heavy than I expected, but once one major thing is revealed, I saw the direction the film intended to go, and found myself interested to see how it would play out. The movie tells an impressive story and brings some complex moral ideas to the forefront. Overall, this is a well-made movie that despite its age, feels effective in how it is made on a technical level while also boasting an original and engaging story.",4,5

Rotten Tomatoes,TWMax65,Harakiri,"100% and 97%?? Dang. I mean the film is well-made and has good sequences/scenes and some good acting but that was about it. Other than that I feel it's for sure overrated. In my opinion it's just a fair black and white Japanese movie about Samurai, suicidal customs, and a sad family story, nothing more really. There's way too much talking for much of the movie and it got kind of boring and even hard to follow. I feel like I would like it more if I spoke Japanese and didn't have to rely on subtitles constantly. It just didn't hit hard enough like I expected it to and if it weren't for some of the more impressive filmmaking techniques then I would've rated it lower.",2.5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,eduardosuarez,Harakiri,"I didn't care for Seven Samurai, mostly because of the slapstick elements that I found jarring. Harakiri is deadly serious by comparison. There is an air of tension and mystery that is built up to around the half hour mark, when the film is at its most engrossing. It lost me a bit in the middle, with about 30 minutes of flashbacks that really could have been told in a few lines of dialogue. Stick around for the third act though, and you're rewarded with some striking visuals and a memorable duel.",3.5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Christopher B,Harakiri,"One of the most beautiful and emotional Samurai films I have ever had the pleasure of watching! The story actually goes in a uniquely different portrayal of the Japanese feudal system and even of the Samurai code. It has a very human touch that is truly inspiring and heart wrenching all the same. With an intense and emotional buildup, the last half an hour really explodes into ""an orgy of violence"" as my good friend and frequent film watcher Brad said. The violence, unlike most modern films, is an expression of a means to an end and upholding personal honor for oneself and their family. It is justified and beautiful in it's savagery and blood lust. Tatsuya Nakadai does an amazing job and his portrayal of the down and out samurai is brilliant in it's complexity! This is truly a marvel to behold thanks to Criterion's stunning Blu-ray transfer of this gorgeous B&W film! Highly Recommended!",5,5
Rotten Tomatoes, ,Harakiri,"One of the best films ever made. Its inventive cinematography, superb acting, and wonderful storytelling through flashbacks make this a ""Citizen Kane"" of Japanese films.",5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,andres s,Harakiri,"Very atmospheric. Reminds me of Kaneto Shindo's films. Great lighting too. I love the intensely suspenseful music. Wow, this is heavy. This samurai wants to kill himself on this guys land because he can no longer live in poverty and without job. Wtf that's odd. The previous samurai, Motome, that came to the Iyi house said the same exact thing Hanshiro said. Ok this is interesting. Saito's men are trying to see if Motome is genuine about his desires to commit suicide or if he's just trying to get a job, food and new clothes from them. It's so crazy to think that this was a thing back in the days. That this was a part of the samurai code of honor and that the other samurai's had to witness this act while this person basically disemboweled themselves. It perplexes me how such a violent, brutal and selfish act was considered honorary and was a thing allowed to go on back then. I guess that's why it's forever gone now and not practiced anymore. Omg holy shit! They gave Motome his own sword to kill himself with! It's not a real steel sword, it's made out of bamboo!! Oh fuck, this is gonna hurt him. Well, he probably shouldn't have posed as a samurai with a fake sword. That scene was so visceral, I wasn't expecting it to be so bloody. 

There were so many formalities in Japanese culture back in the days. Wow, this Hanshiro guy is quite the remarkably disciplined man. Hmm, it seems Saito and this Iyi clan are pretty corrupt and dishonorable. God the backstory to what happened to Hanshiro and Motome is so sad and tragic. Poverty killed the family, quite literally. It killed Hanshiro's daughter and his little grandson since they couldn't afford to hire a doctor for help. It's crazy how relevant this story is to this day. Unfortunately poverty will always exist and will always be relevant. And poverty breeds desperation.  What's disgusting is how this Iyi clan almost took pleasure in knowing that Motome's death was not a clean one, it was a brutal one. It really is a series of unfortunate events and circumstances. I love how Hanshiro said that the samurai honor is just a facade. 

Dude omg I love the shift in tone towards the end. When he throws the topknots of the two samurai's he's already fought. It's going to get epic as fuck! Wow, that shot of them two walking through the cemetery and the bamboo tree path was incredible. That duel at the end between Hanshiro and Omodaka was gorgeously cinematic. The wind blowing, the statues in the background, the landscape. It was perfection. The build up to that final battle at the Iyi house was beautiful. Wow, funny how Saito wants to cover up the truth of what happened because of pride and reputation. But he also skewed the truth to make Hanshiro look like a hero, saying that he was the only one who committed harakiri. When in fact Omodaka did the same at his home, but now Saito wants it to be known that they died of illness. That they didn't die with samurai honor. I guess in the end Hanshiro did make a lasting impact on Saito. Hanshiro went out like a badass, on his own terms. And on top of that he defiled the Iyi clan and their house and left the whole place bloodied and scarred so they'll never forget him - leaving his legacy for all to see. Even though those fuckers at the end pulled out muskets and shot him.

Gracefully shot and elegantly poetic. A thought-provoking and tragic movie about honor, corruption, hypocrisy and poverty. I love the intensity, seriousness and stillness of it all. I love how the story unravels and how we discover how Hanshiro and Motome's stories are intertwined. We get beautifully tragic backstory on Hanshiro, Motome, and their family including Hanshiro's daughter/Motome's wife and their grandson/son. Masterfully crafted story telling. As the story unfolds, everything starts to piece together brilliantly like a jigsaw puzzle. I'd watch it again for sure.",5,5

The film presents a moral ambiguity that is explored in a brilliant way, to say the least, showing the human sides of the characters. 
This is not a film about murder, it is a film about the brevity of escapism from reality and the almost perpetual lingering discomfort about what comes next.
Perfect, in every way. But this movie will make you uncomfortable because of the relationship between the protagonists.",5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Andrew M,Leon The Professional,"Léon: The Professional

There’s no denying that Léon: The Professional has earned its reputation as a cinematic classic, but for me, the film is far from perfect. While the performances—particularly those of Natalie Portman as Mathilda and Gary Oldman as the unhinged antagonist—are commendable, the movie’s unsettling undertones and questionable relationship dynamics cast a long shadow over its strengths.

The core of the story, which revolves around a lonely hitman (Jean Reno) and a young girl seeking revenge for her family’s murder, is undeniably compelling. Portman, in her debut role, is remarkable, showcasing maturity and talent beyond her years. Gary Oldman’s maniacal performance is as captivating as it is terrifying, adding a chaotic energy that keeps you on edge.

However, the “extended version” of the film, which delves deeper into the bond between Léon and Mathilda, crosses a line that made me deeply uncomfortable. The implications of their relationship veer into inappropriate territory, undermining the emotional depth and making it hard to root for their dynamic. Even in the standard cut, some moments feel exploitative rather than heartfelt.

Despite its flaws, the movie excels in its technical aspects. The cinematography is visually stunning, capturing both the gritty urban setting and the tender, isolated moments between the leads. The action sequences are choreographed with precision, and the pacing keeps the story engaging.

Ultimately, Léon: The Professional is a well-made film with undeniable artistic merit, but it’s also a deeply flawed one. The troubling themes and uneven tone make it a difficult watch, and while its impact on the genre is notable, it left me more conflicted than moved.",4.5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,João Victor M,Leon The Professional,"The direction wasn't exceptional, but Gary Oldman’s performance as the policeman who listens to music stood out and effectively conveyed the director's intent. The story felt too short, skipping over Natalie Portman’s Matilda's development after losing her family. Danny Aiello’s Tony deserves credit for opposing her training as a killer, and the plot could have been better developed if Matilda had helped Jean Reno’s Léon leave that life, considering her past trauma. The ending, initially seeming cliché, turned out to be surprising and intelligent, with a symbolic touch in the scene where she plants Léon's plant.",2.5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Marcus K,Leon The Professional,Great action movie.   Would highly recommend.,4.5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Joshua P,Leon The Professional,"Such a great film. It's amazing - there is definitely a lot to be said about the film and art that gets people talking does a really good job in my opinion. I loved it.

However, it can't be denied that the production of the film was really dodgy. Natalie Portman didn't deserve what she got. When you're hurting people or animals or destroying stuff of real value in the purpose of creating art, the ends never justify the means. It didn't in Natalie Portman's case, it didn't in Shelly Duvall's case, it didn't in the case of the animals hurt in the making of Cannibal Holocaust.",4.5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Landon J,Leon The Professional,"It was rather.... weird to see the one sided and frankly uncomfortable dynamic between the leads during moments of this movie.

This is one of those rare movies where I felt no conflict between what happened and what I thought should have been better, throughout the movie. Even though I felt sad sometimes, but it was the right and obvious choice. The relationship between Mathilda and Leon felt real. Mathilda having lived in a toxic household clung to someone who showed even an ounce of protection for her and Leon having lived alone most of his life found a companion in Mathilda. Both the actors did a great job and definitely the director Luc Besson did the best. Also, Gary Oldman was also likeable in someway, the way he lived the character, I just loved it.",5,5

Humphrey Bogart’s Rick Blaine oozes cool from the first frame, and Claude Rains nearly steals the movie as Captain Renault. The narrative is tight, the characters are distinct and the film’s emotional payoff still lands more than 80 years later.

Rotten Tomatoes,Glafira Regina O,The Great Gatsby 2013,"When a film is based on good writing, you can feel it right away. Especially when the director and screenwriter understand what makes it powerful and work hard to bring that to the screen. This movie is vibrant, colorful, melodramatic, and at the same time – tragic.
What’s it about? Love, money, secrets, and inevitable tragedy.

Even though the movie runs for over two hours, it’s easy and engaging to watch. That’s because there’s a sense of intrigue that keeps you on edge until the very end. Add to that a well-written script and absolutely stunning visuals. The cinematography is mesmerizing: everything is rich, vivid, and spectacular. The sets, camera work, and costumes are all top-notch.

The soundtrack also deserves a shout-out. I was pleasantly surprised to hear modern music in certain scenes, even though the story is set in the early 1920s. But what’s fascinating is that it doesn’t feel out of place at all — in fact, it really adds to the atmosphere.

This film isn’t just a beautiful love story. There’s a deeper message that doesn’t hit you over the head but is felt throughout. It’s the story of Gatsby and Daisy — how it all began, why it turned out the way it did, and how it ended. The contrast between Gatsby’s lavish parties and the poverty of those living just next door is especially striking.

While the core idea isn’t brand-new, it’s presented in such an engaging way that you can’t help but follow the plot with interest.

The characters feel alive, each in the right place, and by the end, everything becomes clear — who’s who and what their motivations were.

After reading the novel and watching the film, I think it  does not capture the characters and the mood of the novel. 

The visual theme of the movie isn't bad, it depicts the old class society and how it looked like in the 1920s, but what really stood out to me negatively was the music choice. 

During Gatsby's parties they chose possible the worst music to put in a film set in the 1920s. There was no way that the music was made in that era and it did not fit in it. 

Also, the scenes also could've used more detail and could elaborate it more and be creative with it. 

The scenes were obviously based off the book but I felt that they could've played around with the script more and gave it a little bit more creativity. 

Therefore, this movie despite having a tremendous amount of material to work with, did not meet my satisfaction.",2.5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Gia Hung P,The Great Gatsby 2013,"The Great Gatsby The movie looks amazing with bright colors, big parties, and modern music.

The best part is the visuals. The parties are huge and exciting. The music is not from the 1920s, but it makes the movie feel fresh.
But the story has problems. Gatsby (DiCaprio) is interesting, but Nick (Tobey Maguire) is boring. The movie focuses too much on big scenes and not enough on feelings. Some parts look great but don’t make you care about the characters.

Overall, The Great Gatsby is a beautiful movie but not very deep. It’s good if you like stylish films, but not great if you want a strong story.",3,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Thai Bao N,The Great Gatsby 2013,"After reading the novel and watching the movie from school, I do believe people should at least watch it.

When observing the Great Gatsby film, I saw that the movie missed out some part of the novel. Most of the part that they skipped is honesty important part in the novel.

One scene that they skipped was the funeral. It honestly is not, the important part to be in the film since it showed how people never cared about Gatsby. That and how Gatsby father and what he is so emotionally about.

Another example is the last part where Tom and Nick shook hands. In the novel, it showed what Nick think about Tom and what he did to Gatsby.

However, in the film, his introduced with fireworks, loud music, making it not seem mysterious or subtle. 
Another example would be the reunion between Gatsby and Daisy. Another great example was the reunion between Daisy and Gatsby. In the novel, Daisy is torn between Gatsby and Tom, showing how much she struggles. While in the film, everything seemed so rushed and unbearable, overly dramatic and sentimental.

I didn't like the portrayal of Gatsby in this movie. In the movie Gatsby is really awkward and seems uncomfortable, but in the novel he is charming, nonchalant, and mysterious. The movie also undermines Daisy's character making her seem unaware and shallow. In the novel Daisy's character is much more complicated, she is more calculated and deep than what she is portrayed as in the movie. 
 
Overall, the movie strips the characters of their personality making it less authentic than the novel.",2,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Gabriel P,The Great Gatsby 2013,"After reading the novel, I think the movie does not do that bad of a job reflecting the book and the events. The only think that stuck out like a sore thumb was the pacing. Even though the film may have skipped big chunks for time's sake, it was kind of a bother.

One example of this was the fact that they did not show any of the romance occurring between Daisy and Nick in the film, which is present in the book. This helped to contribute to the confusion of the pacing in the film.

Another example was the film skipping over the events of when Jordan was describing herself and what she does in her time. This aids to make Jordan seem even more alienated/more of a side character in the film than what she already feels like in the book.

Although the film did not do a terrible job explaining the events of The Great Gatsby, the pacing of the story could have done better to aid to the understanding of the viewer by at least explaining more of the smaller details.",3.5,5

Comparing the book and this film, I found that in this movie they missed details that only the book has.

DiCaprio portrayed the character well by looking sharp and clean. Another reason is I love how the parties were crazy and full of people and it portrays that they never really cared about Gatsby at all and it showed how good of a friend Nick was. and EXTRA POINTS for playing ""Young and beautiful"" by Lana Del Ray.

After reading the novel and watching the film, I think the film does capture setting of The Great Gatsby.

The movie really put on display the true extravagance of Gatsby's parties, Let it be the pacing, the music, or the way the parties are composed during the scenes. The movie also demonstrates the true delusions of Jay Gatsby. The facial expressions that Leonardo Dicaprio makes and the tone of his voice when talking about his ""future"" really make you feel as if he is the character. The movie is all around a good port of the book though I would've liked for more Nick and Jordan romance.",4,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Tinkle T,The Great Gatsby 2013,"I had read the book before and with this i had the ability to easily spot some flaws with the book, for example; one major flaw with the movie is its music choices. Having the movie set in the 1920s and using more modern music makes the movie feel rushed or personalized, giving a slight disrespect to the novel's time. Another heavy example is its accuracy and pacing, it skips and alters heavy significance. A standout was Gatsby being more angry and obsessive over daisy than his novel counterpart, even making him threaten tom when in reality he had stood his ground.",3,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Edward M,The Great Gatsby 2013,"My fabulous teacher is making me write this film review after our unit on the great Gatsby.  After reading the novel and watching the film I think the film does capture the setting, characters, and themes from the book. but the music choices I feel are too modern for the setting and themes. Like how they played Jay-z and Lana Del ray Songs although the Lana Del ray song sort of fit the mood. all in all It was a decent film and a great story with well picked actors but could have been executed better. I feel that Gatsby couldn't have been payed by anyone better than Leonardo Di Caprio And Toms actor also suits him with his brute and aggressive sort of mannerisms. If you are looking for a interesting movie none the less this is a good choice despite the mistakes I feel they made producing this film.",3,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Isaiah G,The Great Gatsby 2013,"Changing up the plot of a book to adapt it into a movie is typically ok. I feel that the story being told from nick talking to a therapist really changed the whole vibe. It went from a guy talking to you about a crazy summer he had into a guy talking to a professional about his feelings, at least that's the vibe I got. Also the editing being fast paced and them using lana del ray really took me out of the movie. it almost felt like a tiktok edit of a dramatic Mr beast video. I still enjoyed the movie tho!!",2.5,5

I have reprised several at home recently, and was astonished at how riveting this movie still is after nearly 40 years.  Costner's band of Dudley Do-right characters is a little hard to take, but the performances are heartfelt.  DeNiro is terrifying as Capone, and his organization at times seems unstoppable.  Ultimately it is DePalma's masterful direction that carries the whole thing off so well.  It remains near the top of my top 10 list of all time.",5,5

Rotten Tomatoes,Jasper  M,Untouchables,"Harsh but good, likeable main character, great actors.",4,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Rushdi I,Untouchables,"In 1987, Brian De Palma's The Untouchables hit the big screen, offering an exhilarating and stylish retelling of the war between law enforcement and the criminal empire of Al Capone during Prohibition. Adapted from Eliot Ness's memoir, the film became a critical and commercial success, blending historical facts with dramatic flair, and solidifying its place as one of the most iconic crime dramas ever made. With standout performances, taut direction, and a memorable score, The Untouchables continues to resonate as a quintessential piece of American cinema.

At its core, The Untouchables is a classic tale of good versus evil, but what makes it so compelling is its complex portrayal of the moral and ethical compromises that the characters must navigate. Set in 1930s Chicago, the film follows Eliot Ness (Kevin Costner), a determined Treasury agent, as he assembles a team to take down the notorious gangster Al Capone (Robert De Niro). In a city rife with corruption, Ness faces not only the challenge of dealing with Capone's criminal empire but also the ingrained dishonesty within his own government and law enforcement.
What sets the story apart from typical gangster fare is its exploration of justice within a system that often seems stacked against the good guys. The personal stakes for Ness and his team are high, and their struggle is both a quest for redemption and an attempt to bring order to an otherwise chaotic world. As the story unfolds, the tension between legal methods and brute force escalates, leading to a series of thrilling confrontations that keep audiences on the edge of their seats.
While the film takes creative liberties, it remains grounded in its depiction of the period, using the historical backdrop of Prohibition to highlight the corruption that permeates all levels of society. It’s a morally ambiguous landscape where even the lawmen are tested, and the lines between right and wrong are often blurred. The final result is a poignant, intense, and action-packed narrative that never loses sight of its central theme: justice at any cost.

The Untouchables is a star-studded affair, featuring a talented ensemble cast that elevates the film beyond its action-driven premise. Kevin Costner, in one of his defining roles, portrays Eliot Ness with a quiet but steadfast determination. Costner brings a sense of integrity and inner conflict to the role, playing a man who is trying to navigate the moral quagmire of the criminal justice system. Ness is a character that demands both resilience and vulnerability, and Costner strikes a delicate balance between these qualities.
The film's standout performance, however, comes from Sean Connery, who plays Jim Malone, an aging Irish-American cop and the emotional heart of the team. Connery’s portrayal of Malone is both tough and tender, providing the wisdom and mentorship that the younger, less experienced Ness desperately needs. Connery won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for this role, and rightly so—he brings gravitas, humor, and warmth to what could have been a one-dimensional character. His memorable line, “Here’s how I deal with this,” followed by a shocking act of violence, is just one of many moments where Connery’s commanding presence steals the show. His chemistry with Costner is palpable, and their dynamic is one of the film’s key emotional anchors.
On the opposite side, Robert De Niro’s portrayal of Al Capone, while relatively brief, is no less memorable. De Niro does not need to portray Capone as a cartoonish villain; instead, he brings a chilling sense of intelligence, ambition, and ruthless charm to the role. His Capone is calculating, always in control, and possesses a deep understanding of how to manipulate those around him. De Niro’s subtle performance makes Capone feel omnipresent, even when he’s not physically on screen, and it elevates the stakes of the film. His interactions with Ness and the rest of the lawmen are tense and electrifying, and De Niro’s presence looms over every scene.
The supporting cast, including Andy Garcia as the rookie cop George Stone and Charles Martin Smith as the nerdy accountant Oscar Wallace, also shines. Garcia’s Stone, while not as fully developed as the main trio, adds another layer of grit and determination, serving as both a rookie with a chip on his shoulder and a loyal member of the team. Smith, on the other hand, brings humor and vulnerability to his role, adding some levity to what is otherwise a dark and tense story.

Brian De Palma, known for his mastery of suspense and visual style, directs The Untouchables with a sense of purpose and intensity that keeps the audience engaged from start to finish. De Palma’s use of tension and violence is expertly balanced, never feeling gratuitous, and his pacing ensures that the film doesn’t drag, even during the quieter moments.
The film’s cinematography, by Stephen H. Burum, is nothing short of spectacular. De Palma and Burum create a visual language that speaks volumes, using light, shadows, and composition to reflect the themes of the film. The use of contrasting colors—particularly in the depiction of Capone’s opulent world versus the grimy, gritty reality of Ness’s team—adds to the visual storytelling. One of the most famous sequences, the iconic elevator shootout, is a masterclass in tension-building. The slow-motion shots, combined with Ennio Morricone’s rousing score, create a sequence that has become one of the most memorable action scenes in cinematic history.

Ennio Morricone’s score for The Untouchables is one of the film’s most iconic elements. The legendary composer’s music, with its sweeping orchestral arrangements and haunting melodies, perfectly complements the film’s tone. The main theme, both triumphant and mournful, embodies the emotional weight of the film’s story while capturing the larger-than-life battle between law and crime. Morricone’s score, like the film itself, is both epic and intimate, and it plays a crucial role in amplifying the emotional resonance of the film’s most pivotal moments.
Conclusion: A Timeless Classic
The Untouchables remains a cinematic gem more than three decades after its release. It is a thrilling, suspenseful, and richly layered film that combines historical drama with modern filmmaking techniques. The stellar performances, particularly from Connery and De Niro, elevate the material, and Brian De Palma’s direction ensures that the film remains gripping from beginning to end. With its unforgettable score, memorable lines, and expertly crafted action sequences, The Untouchables stands as one of the finest films of the 1980s and a defining moment in the gangster genre. Whether you're a fan of crime dramas or just appreciate great filmmaking, The Untouchables is a film that will continue to captivate and entertain for generations to come.👌🏾👌🏾👌🏾👌🏾👌🏾",5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Rami A,Untouchables,"Much like ""Scarface,"" ""The Untouchables"" resonates emotionally with its audience. The performances are all excellent; Kevin Costner delivers a solid performance, Sean Connery gives one of his best performances, and Robert De Niro seems to be enjoying himself, despite his limited screen time. I would've liked to have seen more of him, but alas, what we got is better than nothing.

The film masterfully captures the tension of the Prohibition era and the relentless pursuit of justice. The cinematography adds to the allure, showcasing elaborate set pieces and intense action sequences that keep viewers on the edge of their seats. The chemistry among the cast members strengthens the narrative, particularly the dynamic between Costner's character and Connery's seasoned veteran. Additionally, the film’s score enhances the dramatic moments, making them even more memorable.

Rotten Tomatoes,Kyle M,Cinema Paradiso,"If there's a strong cinematic advocation for moviegoing experiences through a narrative, Giuseppe Tornatore's Italian masterpiece ""Cinema Paradiso"" at the time celebrated the gathering events, only to age finely in eternalizing the commemoration. Though haven't seen Tornatore's prior nor sequential works, why this certain film has been raised by critical acclaim to the top as one of the greatest films of all time, plus frequently seen as a love letter to the movies, generated intrigue above others – besides symbolized as Italian cinema's revitalization that paved way for contemporary classics. Compelled through that entry, the wondrous fascination of the cinema it empathizes with is partially the main theme, however further enriched when branched between how it connects the community and nurtures growth upon witnessing the picture. The proclaimed nostalgia seems to have spoken amid the middle of societal distancing before contrast to the current state when back then it gathers and unites than just facial passersby.

The story is told in flashback when filmmaker Salvatore Di Vita receives news from his mother that his friend/mentor Alfredo passed away. He recalls his childhood taken place in a war-torn Sicilian village whereas he discovered escapism just by going to the local movie palace during any free time. His distractive obsession would disappoint his mother and sometimes bother projectionist Alfedo, who would eventually not only teach him the importance of his task but also how it planted his love for film. Young Salvatore grown with further newfound passion for film, eventually taking over the position, with wondrously innovative ideas, and tend to capture moments by camera in interacting with the form, leading him to fall in love with a beautiful girl. The pair's conflictive social status gets complicates and pulls him from his passion, so Alfredo must convince him to leave beyond the small town's limits to pursue filmmaking and explore storytelling by integrating ideas he established during his time as projectionist.

Writer-director Tornatore reasonably prophesized the sort of impact cinema arguably still possesses, therefore verifying how much of a timelessly thoughtful classic this acclaimed excellence turned out to be. There are concrete connections evoked through both growth and community towards the cinema as specialized instance observed through Alfredo's hefty background evolved onto his bond with Salvatore, especially when he's aware of the societal limitations that doesn't offer opportunities to further pursue, horizontally expand the passionately inspired potential. Salvatore reluctantly does that in the third act, found opportunities to share his nurtured gifts, and his love for cinema expressed in his pictures meeting critical acclaim with similar results Alfredo witnessed in the projection booth in uniting the audience. These moments ideally resonate in enjoying the little things manifested from youthful wonder to community's welcomed quirky corners, also taking place whenever in the auditorium immersed by the moving picture joining in the collective entertainment while examining different types of moviegoers. The nostalgia here lies in that collective discovery before technological platforms dissected those interests by reductions into certain categories accommodating differential entertainment.

While the meaningful takeaway from this is the overarching theme, it was certainly strengthened. Remarkable performances from the cast, especially Philippe Noiret as Alfredo with a definitive standard that seemingly pioneered the term ""cinephile"" while sharing nice dynamics with both Salvatore Cascio and Marco Leonardi portraying Salvatore as he grows and connects then innovates forward. Both characters display relatability amidst their interaction towards the theme. Both Cascio and Leonardi built the character so well, with Jacques Perrin seamlessly picking up where they developmentally left off. Their scenes are powered by Ennio Morricone's typically mesmerizing score at one of his finest, exceptionally emphasizing feelings, in adjacent to the imprinted set pieces underlying reminiscently and replicating the directorially prompted assignment. His second son Andrea followed by providing a lovely score in one delicately embracing scene between Leonardi's Salvatore and Agnese Nano's Elena.

To describe how much Tornatore cares about the quality of his storytelling, what he's trying to communicate by achievement and what's best for the characters with satisfying resolutions, there are two versions to this. The original, which I haven't seen, has a straight-forward focus that can be deciphered in the other version being the extended Director's Cut. In the latter version, after Salvatore paid his respect to Alfredo, he reunites with his lost romance. Honestly, the film dragged on at that point, but it shows how much Tornatore respects his stories to the fullest, wanting to resolve the romantic plot point that was prevented and not leave anything unanswered. Roger Ebert praised the original version as superior, which I agree with as I noticed the direction the film was heading and how it transitions differently under proper buildup. Nonetheless, the longer you find yourself in ""Cinema Paradiso"", the more you'll appreciate what it stands for under a fantastical vision, which is something worth seeing on the big screen that just might enhance the moviegoing routine.

Rotten Tomatoes,Josh A,Alien,"You know, for a sci-fi horror movie made in the 1970s, this movie looks fantastic. It looks like a modern sci-fi movie or something like Jason X, but it also has a retro vibe to it that I'm fond of. And I think that describes this film well: it's a classic, sure, but it also feels weirdly modern. Let's get into it.

The story, essentially, is that a crew on a spaceship go to a planet called LV426, they find an alien specimen, it gets attached to a crew member who births an alien, more on that later, now they have to deal with this alien. It's good and provides tension, as they don't know what the alien is, and it could do anything. It's also tense as each crew member is picked off one by one. There's also only one survivor by the end, Ripley, who goes into stasis, ending the film on a hopeful note as her and her cat drift off into space, free.

The alien is the best part of the film by far, though. It's like a slasher villain in a sense, picking off the crew members one by one, and it provides constant tension. For instance, instead of hatching from an egg, it latches onto a crew member's face and eventually bursts from a crew member's chest. It's surprising, as it's meant to be, and we barely see the alien, giving it an aura of mystery, which is the best thing with this film: it's mysterious. The crew don't know what the alien is, and neither do we. It's like The Mist in that sense.

Overall, a decent science fiction horror film to start the Alien franchise.",5,5

Rotten Tomatoes,Josh D,Alien,"Given what I know about this film and my feelings about the horror genre, I didn’t think I’d like this movie as much as I did. It had a lot more sci fi intrigue and lore built in than I expected.

Of course, there’s a lot to praise in this movie. The effects, atmosphere, and cast have been praised to death, so I’ll just note that they’re incredible and leave it at that. 

The one lost Star really just comes from a few nitpicky points:

1. I’m not a horror/gore enthusiast, so those elements detract from my overall enjoyment of the movie
2. Towards the end, the flashing lights can be distracting/disorienting in a bad way (as opposed to a good, thematic disorientation)
3. Characters in this movie keep saying “let’s stick together” and then immediately separate. I could’ve looked past one occurrence of this, but it happens on multiple occasions.

But again, those are nitpicks. Fantastic movie, a classic for a reason. But only watch if your last meal is nice and settled.",4,5

Rotten Tomatoes,Ben N,Alien,"Quintessential sci-fi horror. 

The Nostromo is a monstrosity of a ship. Returning from a mining operation, I enjoy the world that the ship is set in is hardly explained... yet it is palpably there. The arguments about contracts and shares, the standing order to investigate an sign of life. And obviously the science officer and Mother.

Anyway, the world she is diverted to is of much more pertinence to this story. From the landing on the planet to when they take off again is one of the creepiest sections of film I can recall. 

Without discussing the plot in detail, suffice it to say I think Alien is a film that kicked off a genre, along with a long line of films in it's own series, and it is deserving of recognition as one of the best sci-fi films of all time.",5,5

Rotten Tomatoes,anthony t,Modern Times,"Modern Times is an interesting film that is highly enjoyable, and funny. You start off by having Charlie Chaplin (Little Tramp) throughout the factory doing his ‘work,’ then following him throughout the film to find a suitable job. This film is one of a lifetime pieces. To think a silent film like this can create such laughter by only seeing the main character doing nothing but being clumsy and missing somewhat common sense. To belief Charlie Chaplin not only wrote, produced, directed and starred in this film is fully inspirational. One has to see this film to fully understand the full love this film rejoices. Not only because of the plot, but because of the amazing acting, and stunts produced within the film. It's just remarkable to see how such a small man can have so much talent to make a whole audience laugh and enjoy an experience like this. This being my first Charlie Chaplin film to ever see, I fully understand why it is loved so much, because I fell in love with it the first time I saw it as well. Overall, I fully encourage plenty of people to see this film with a group of other people who may have also not seen it. You'll laugh, and fall in love with the characters. You'll not only immerse yourself in the time period that this film takes place in, but you'll be immersed into the world of Charlie Chaplin.",5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Brennan W,Modern Times,"Modern Times was a great film when looking back at where it all started. This film, while almost a hundred years old, feels in a lot of ways like its brand new. The main character of the tramp is one that is still known to this day. His role in the film helps take the audience on a wild adventure that not only gives laughs and wacky moments, but touches on real world issues that speak to people even today. Chaplin's ability to act out crazy scenes and entertain an audience for as long as he does says a lot. The film looks great and the set of the factory is so impressive for its time. Overall I enjoyed this film. Most silent films from the 30's can leave a bad taste in my mouth but this one really entertained me. I especially enjoyed the subject matter that the film offers and it opens the room up for conversation that most other silent films wouldn't do. I would higly recommend watching this film.",3,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Javier M,Modern Times,"I’m not a gigantic fan of silent films but an exception is always drawn when it comes to Charlie Chaplin, a true genius. I absolutely enjoyed this film and would definitely recommend it to many people, it is worthy of many watches and it was really entertaining. One observation I spotted is in regards to the year it was released, released during the transition of silent to sound, this might just have been one of the last great silent films made, making this even more of a special film to watch. Undoubtedly, my favorite scene from the film is the scene in the prison where he beats up the prisoners trying to escape and attack the guards all by himself after one of them got busted for sneaking something in, in a hilarious scene Chaplin's character sees the product and eats it with his food, his eyes become so wide after every bite it made me laugh every time. After that, you see Chaplin basically act all chaotic after consuming this, he fools around before not entering his cell, after that the prisoners come in and lock the officers up but Charlie saves the day in a three on one brawl, entertaining stuff. Charlie’s rewarded with immediate freedoms but he denies it as he likes the prison. I also really love the addition of Paulette Goddard’s character, she’s essential to the plot, when we first see her you can just tell how much of a tough and resilient character she is. I adored the relationship between the two as they embark on a journey despite all their setbacks, clearly in love with one another. They’d do anything for each other, she finds a beat up house while he was locked up and makes it their home, she also gets him a job at the club she performs at. Whilst Chaplin’s character helps her when they encounter each other, he takes credit for stealing the bread she stole, and he also sneaks her into his first day on the job of looking out for the mall during the night, letting her sleep comfortably. Overall, great stuff from Chaplin.",4.5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Miriam F,Modern Times,"Modern Times (Writ./Dir. Charlie Chaplin, 1936) is a silent comedy that follows the life of a factory worker and his struggles to maintain an income. Later in the film he befriends an orphaned girl who accompanies him on the rest of his journey and through a constant cycle of getting hired, then getting fired, and even making it to jail. When you take an initial look at the story and just from hearing its basic form, modern audiences could even empathize with these characters given the state of the current economy. Furthermore some scenes fuel the empathy we feel, for example, an instance in which the pair find a home but it is a very run down sort of cabin. Even though they have found a place of which the conditions are questionable, they feel as though this was the long awaited home they’ve longed for. What doesn’t make this film feel as depressing as it sounds is the comedic aspect. In my opinion, the film relies too heavily on this to the point that the main character becomes frustrating. It’s essentially a comedy with no structure and a continuous cycle of the protagonist not knowing how to handle his obstacles. There is a specific scene towards the end of the film in which the protagonist gets hired as a waiter at a cafe and he has to serve a roast duck to a client who has been waiting for a while. However everyone in the place takes to the dance floor and our main character fails to serve the roast duck about 3 times and ultimately ends up losing the duck when the floor clears. This might just not be my type of comedy and I would warn anyone with similar dislikes from watching this film.",2.5,5

Rotten Tomatoes,Viviana A,Modern Times,"I really enjoyed this film. I thought it was funny but also thought-provoking at the same time, and I think it’s still so relevant today despite being from 1936, it being about a character as he struggles to adapt to the modern, industrialized world. There is a mix of comedy with some social commentary. It was entertaining to see Chaplin manage to make you laugh while also making you think about the challenges of a working class life. I enjoyed how the director and star Charlie Chaplin used the setting to tell the story and show the times around industrialization. The camera work in Modern Times is also fascinating to watch especially in the factory scenes. I think the use of visual gags is great, and he uses the camera to emphasize the craziness of the situations that he finds himself in, like when he gets caught in the gears of the machine. It’s clever and entertaining. Obviously Chaplin’s performance was amazing, he has the ability to express so much without speaking, only using just his physical comedy and facial expressions to get across. There was incredible direction, great gags, and  it’s a film that still countries to entertain.",4,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Eliza B,Modern Times,"“Modern Times” was surprisingly enjoyable and relatable. Chaplin’s performance and use of slapstick comedy as a vehicle for social critique makes this film visually appealing and surprisingly relevant to modern audiences. This was the first of Chaplin’s films that I have seen and, especially for a silent film made in 1936, it holds up very well. The story is easy to follow, the characters are relatable, and many of the jokes stand the test of time. Chaplin’s performance is engaging and humorous, an essential requirement for a silent film, especially a silent comedy. Many of the set pieces are technologically innovative such as the roller skating scene and the illusion of danger it provides as well as the automatic worker feeding machine. One of the aspects of the film that I enjoy the most is how innocent the main character is in everything he does, a victim of capitalism and industrialization, he is simply trying his hardest within the system he lives in. He has a mishap at every corner and, despite ending up homeless, the film makes it clear that the problem isn’t with the character but with society and industrialization in that time period. One of the flaws of the film is that it does seem a little piecemeal, while the gags and visuals are engaging, the plot has some holes and isn’t entirely cohesive. In spite of this, the film has a lot to say about capitalism, the monotony of factory work, the frustration with automation (especially of things that don’t need automation), and the enduring human spirit in spite of challenges. This film is entertaining, engaging, technologically innovative and all around a good watch.",4.5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Yeet 1,Modern Times,"Overall I liked Modern Times as a film. I think that the way that it covered what being a factory worker during the great depression was extremely unique in the way that they showed how competitive the job market was. Which is sort of similar to the times we live into today where the job market can be extremely competitive. Which ties one of my favorite scenes in the film which is the labor protest to our modern day with our recent union and guild strikes in Hollywood. Which shows that the film is still relevant to the modern times we live in because we live in a time that is very similar to the great depression in the way that new technologies like AI are causing rapid change and upheaval in many industries and threatening the entire existence of many others. Which is making available jobs more sparse like in the great depression. Not to mention housing is an issue for many now much like how the Tramp and Gamin are forced to live in a shack because other housing is unobtainable to them due to their financial situation.
Not to mention food is extremely expensive for most people in society today. Which is very similar to how Gamin has to steal food in order to eat. The gap between the poor and the rich today is very similar to the times portrayed in Modern Times. Where the rich are extremely rich and the poor are extremely poor which reminds us about how relevant old films can be to our current times.",5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Nyla E,Modern Times,"This film is very enjoyable to watch as it is filled with fun and laughter. Even though it has its comedy, there are several aspects of the film make it feel modern. First, the discussion on labor. In the film, Charlie Chaplin’s character goes into a manic state due to working to hard. This is somewhat relevant to soldiers having PTSD and kind of having to go through getting help on their own. Like how Charlie Chaplin’s character went to jail. Second, the sound aspect of this film, although this is set to be a silent film there is dialpogue. This is shown in when Chaplin’s character is seen taking a quick break in the bathroom then the boss shows up on a screen and tells him to get back to work. Another is when they’re introducing the feeding machine to the boss through a speaker. Lastly, the gamin she’s is a morally gray character where she steals food to feed her family and other children. I think that having a character that does bad for good wasn’t common during this time. When I first watched this film, it kind of went over my head because characters like this are extremely common. But after taking a step back I realized how ahead its time that character is and its true to people in real life. I guess you could say the Chaplin’s character is morally gray as well because when he works as a night guard he sneaks in the gamin to give her food and a place to eat. As well as giving his former coworker, who was planning to rob the place, some food because he’s hungry. As the guard he’s supposed stop people from coming in but because he understands its harsh times he lets it slide. This film is a very fun watch and is complex for its time. Definitely recommend!",4,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Eric D,Modern Times,"Modern Times by Charlie Chaplin is an amazing film that is greatly constructed. This film takes a great approach to experimenting with sound because although it is mostly considered a silent film, there are many scenes where sound is used to emphasize an action by a character, set a scene location specifically in the factory, and even at one point singing. Adding audio made it not only very interesting to experience since having sound on film at the time was not being done often or correctly, but it also shaped an important part of the history of film. Chaplin's ability to use some sound correctly throughout the film made it even more interesting to watch compared to other silent films. This continues to show how talented and creative Charlie Chaplin was and also how his films were way ahead of their time, including this one. Now, aside from its amazing sound aspects, the reason why I didn't rate this film five stars is because there were certain parts where the scenes lasted a little too long, which made it hard to stay engaged. Although it didn't happen as often to make me dislike the film, it did happen enough times to make it noticeable. The story that the film follows is greatly told visually, which made the scenes that I mentioned before not that big of an issue since it was still easy to follow and interpret in different ways which I enjoy when films do. Overall, Modern Times should be a must-watch film to understand what real cinema looks like and see the impact Charlie Chaplin had on the film industry.",4,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Ray T,Modern Times,"Charlie Chaplin’s Modern Times, where Chaplin was both the director and actor, more like an auteur, together with his iconic exaggerated comedic body language while looking into the contemporary societal issue like the emerging of communism in the american community and its impact on the people, also reflect on the advent of industrialization and how the society responses to it. This is really standing out and makes it unique and grasp my attention. I was especially touched by the scene where The Tramp met Ellen the orphan girl and together they dream about their future. Although they have nothing at the moment, but it’s inspirational that they’re still able to dream for the future and work hard on getting it.

I wouldn’t consider it as silent film but I would say a transitional period, this can be seen in the minimal use of title card, introduction of some key dialogue, sound effect, and most impressively is a singing sequence by the character on screen. However, I do feel that there should be more female representation on screen rather than merely the orphan and te clerk, still some harassment scenes were portrayed.

The film has a budget of $1.5M in 1936 which is tremendous consider to today’s standard. I think it was well made and is understandably a masterpiece by the legend himself because it has a terrific production design, avant-garde cinematography as well as the performance and stunt made by the actors. As a film students I have huge respect for the filmmakers and casts working on this film, constantly innovating and breaking boundaries, and serving as a beacon of light for the film industry.",3.5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Isaac C,Modern Times,"Charlie Chaplain's final silent film is not only entertaining but impressive as well. First and foremost, Chaplin’s physical capability of performing the stunts he does can not be understated. The scene where Charlie is blindfolded roller skating imparticular absolutely baffled me. The many actions taken by Chaplin throughout the film are nothing short of riveting and entertaining. That being said many action sequences do seem to drag which I’ve noticed to be a common reoccurrence with silent films of the era. The story is also simple yet lackluster with an emphasis truly being put towards the action. The humor was also something that alluded me with many comedy sequences lasting longer than needed. A scene imparticular I can only recall is the dinner scene in which Charlie gets stuck in the crowd while trying to deliver food to a table. While it is initially silly it slowly becomes repetitive and eventually boring. However, this humor is entirely subjective and I can understand how one might enjoy it more than I could. However, being released during the Great Depression, I can also see how comedic the film could have seemed. Anyone wanting to escape the hardships of their time could live vicariously through the character of the tramp. To an extent, the film could be seen as a light during a very dark period. Albeit not my sense of humor, I can very much respect the comedy for its time. Overall Modern Times is an entertaining film and a great glimpse into a not-so-distant past.",3.5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Rebecca O,Modern Times,"The film is a timeless social commentary that is both humorous and relevant to even the 21st century. I enjoy the odd comedy of Chaplin’s films and their seamless storytelling abilities. In almost every scene someone is getting hit and Chaplin’s character is always in a strange dilemma. Despite the slapstick humor, the film shows life during the “modern times” and the hardship that followed as society became more industrialized. Modern Times is about assembly line workers battling economic hardships while being introduced to new machines and inventions of the times. This film works to critique industrialization as we can see in the opening scenes, where Chaplin’s character as well as two other factory workers are struggling to keep up with their tasks as the endless bolts keep coming on the conveyor belt. The imagery shows the struggle of factory workers trying to meet the needs of a capitalist capitalist society but never able to keep up or get ahead. The scene reflects the overwhelming mass production where no matter the pace the workers kept at, they struggled with the workload resulting in them getting more and more physical and violent with each other. My favorite scene from the film is when Chaplin’s character winds up in jail. As he is eating his food he steals the salt from the next guy over and unknowingly consumes the smuggled cocaine. He runs around the jail fighting escapees while being high on cocaine. Overall, I feel that Modern Times is a clever and funny film that highlights serious issues like industrialization and class struggles, making this film as relevant today as it was in the 1930s.",4,5

He mirrored the day's real issues and made them relatable even to our time. The reality of drugs being smuggled into prison and the feeling of never being able to get ahead is the sad truth.  The staging and even the seamless editing for the time are remarkable. Humor spilled throughout, and I laughed at small moments and cartoon-like humor that brought out what my kid-like comedy would enjoy. This movie is a standard, made evident by how thought out and production is trying its best to be top-notch. Cheerful yet gloomy, it proves to be. I enjoyed it.

Rotten Tomatoes,Mate P,Once Upon A Time In Hollywood,"Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood is an instant classic. It's not just a film, but a feeling, a vibe and watching it is an event.

The characters are perfectly written. Cliff Booth was my absolute favourite from the start of the film, while I didn't like Rick Dalton at first, but by the end he grew on me. The story is extremely unpredictable. I was surprised to realise that, just like Inglorious Basterds, this is an alteration of a real life event, with both real-life and fictional characters. The dialogues are also perfect. Some of them are quotable classics that I had already come across several times before seeing this film.

The cinematography is amazing and very character-driven. The editing is incredible. The movie is about 160 minutes long, but I never wanted it to end, it was never boring. The production design is gorgeous, they captured that time period extremely well. Everything felt authentic. The casting is more than perfect, the star power is incredible and there are so many talented young actors, who became stars after this film. Both Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio are fantastic, while I loved Margaret Qualley's performance as well.

Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood is a perfect, character-driven film surrounded by a story that is inspired by real life events.",5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Nathaniel B,Once Upon A Time In Hollywood,"If someone were to ask me to lay out the plot of Once Upon A Time In Hollywood, I don't know if I'd be able to coherently do it.

Then there's a weird hippie ranch, and for some reason they attack Brad Pitt while he's high.... And then the movie basically ends there. 

The movie feels well-made, the scenes are crisp, the dialogue is engaging, there's some good scenes, but honestly I don't really know if the movie has a plot or a resolution or anything like that.

Ironically, a movie titled ""Once Upon a Time..."" doesn't really seem to have a real story to it.

Django Unchained probably has the best 15 minutes of any Quentin Tarantino film (if you've seen it you'll know what I'm talking about), while Django Unchained is an extremely dark story and has some hard to watch moments as usual Quentin Tarantino can make the film funny and example is the KKK Mask scene had be laughing my ass off.

Jamie Foxx is honestly massively underrated and I'm really disappointed we have only two Christoph Waltz appearances in Tarantino films because in both he's absolutely magnificent. There is something about Quentin Tarantino Artwork and Editing which makes it addictive and this is the first Tarantino film without the late Sally Menke and somehow it's still the same magic.

Tarantino makes Leonardo Di Caprio a disgusting character and charming and that seems to be a common theme in most of his films for example Mr Blonde, Christoph Waltz (Inglorious Basterds), BILL, even you could argue Vincent Vega was a bad person. I

The Blu-ray extra for the ""Tarantino Xx collection"" honestly is so smooth I've watched it 5 times.

Rotten Tomatoes,Nawt W,City Lights,"The plot itself is not intricate, and almost just like in every comedy, it mostly serves to deliver Tramp to humorous set pieces.

Rotten Tomatoes,Bruce J,City Lights,"When we talk about 'old movies', we see even a silent movie can be better than anything produced today with modern technology.  Funny, endearing, the final scene puts a lump in my throat 40 years after seeing it.  In my opinion, a masterpiece.",5,5

Rotten Tomatoes,King,City Lights,"Alright, so here's the thing about ""City Lights"" – it's an oldie, but oh boy, is it a goodie! This film is Charlie Chaplin at his finest, and if you haven't seen it yet, you gotta rectify that, pronto!

First off, this film is a silent movie. Yes, you heard that right – no dialogues. But the beauty of it is that you don't need words to understand the story. It's a simple yet deeply emotional tale of the Tramp – Chaplin's iconic character – who falls for a blind flower girl. Simple plot? Maybe. But it packs an emotional punch that could knock out a heavyweight boxer.

The humour in ""City Lights"" is slapstick comedy done right. It's Chaplin's trademark, after all. You're gonna laugh out loud at the Tramp's antics and his never-give-up attitude. And there are scenes that are pure comedy gold. But then, just when you think you've got the movie figured out, it hits you with some truly poignant moments that'll tug at your heartstrings.

Chaplin's performance is absolutely top-notch, and he shows that you don't need words to tell a story. His expressive face does all the talking, and man, does it speak volumes. He makes you laugh, he makes you feel, and he makes you root for the Tramp all the way through.

The final scene – just wow! No spoilers here, but let's just say it's one of the most beautifully crafted endings in film history. And trust me, it's gonna stick with you long after the credits roll.

So to sum it up, ""City Lights"" is a must-watch. It's a masterclass in storytelling, a perfect blend of comedy and drama, and a testament to Chaplin's genius. It might be a silent film, but it speaks louder than most of the talkies out there. Don't miss it!",5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Alexander B,City Lights,This is another classic by the legend. City Lights is full of great slap stick comedy that still holds up surprisingly well. It also has some heartfelt moments that feel very real.,5,5

Rotten Tomatoes,joel h,City Lights,"City Lights is a classic motion picture. You can tell that Charlie Chaplin poured his heart and soul into this film. In a time when talking pictures were becoming all the rage, he fought to keep this film silent, and I think that's one of the reasons it stands out among the rest. The story may be considered silly or simple to the modern viewer, but this film has humor, it has heart, and it has drama. Even the acting, while intentionally hokey most of the time, brings real emotion in the end. City Lights is more than just a spectacularly choreographed boxing scene, it's a masterpiece of silent cinema.",4,5
Rotten Tomatoes,TWMax65,City Lights,"The scenes that make the movie are when the Tramp finds himself in the locker room of the boxing gym and in the actual boxing ring. The musical score, directing, and physical humor is spot on, along with when he's at the dinner dance party with his new drunk delirious ""pal""! This is the 3rd film of Chaplin's I've seen and I don't regularly rate movies higher than an 8 on IMDb but there you have it. This is the kind of movie that's perfect to come out and give people laughs during a historic age of economic depression in America.

Revisited this film about 25 years ago and thought it was outstanding.  Watched it again last night with my high-school aged daughter who loves theater arts,  She looked at me at the end and said, ""Dad, that is one of the best movies you have ever showed me.  However, I never want to watch it again"".  That sums up the power of Apocalypse Now.  Gritty, brutal and beautifully filmed.  Excellent character development that contributes to genuinely caring about what happens to everyone on this journey to insanity.

Rotten Tomatoes,Daniel C. M,Apocalypse Now,"This film remains quite a mystery to me, as the 155 minute cut feels too short, but the 3 hour cut feels too long also. The action and effects are something of a true marvel, but it eventually just devolves into a hence and repeat of the same formula over and over again: squad advances to reach Cambodja and Kurtz's Cult HQ (patent pending), they get into a very bad pickle, someone dies or gets injured but they manage to ultimately solve things, repeat. The last 45 minutes are true perfection though, and i dont feel like a need to, nor dont want to spoil, and that's why i recommend this movie. You will never expect and NEED whats in store for the last 45 minutes (Referring to the 155 minute cut, that is).",3.5,5

Rotten Tomatoes,Tyler S,Memento,"Nolan definitely achieved what he was aiming to do when he made this film. Thought it was really creative to tell the story how he did. A pretty simple plot that turns way more complicated. I really enjoy how we are basically put into this story, and we are following along with the main character as to what the issue is. We basically are the main character, just in a first person POV. Now the fact that I have a million questions after this is prolly a good thing, but it really doesn't after my learning of the main story. It is simple questions that make me feel like a PI. I'll have to watch the film a few more times now that I have a grasp of things. Overall, pretty blown away with what Nolan chose to tell us.

Rotten Tomatoes,Wellington C,Memento,"Nolan is doing what Nolan had fun doing in future projects like Inception and Tenet: confusion as entertainment. The idea is very interesting and makes the film truly unique. Through the narrative in reverse, Nolan manages to put the viewer in the protagonist's head and makes us feel all the agony, affliction and despair he feels. However, as much as I love this idea, the execution made the experience very tiring and confusing. As I said, it's part of the creative proposal of the director, who also wrote the script for this project, and he certainly gets points for innovation. The result, however, made the experience less satisfying than it could have been: leaving the viewer as confused as the protagonist, the answers given in the plot twists didn't leave me with the feeling of a finished story. I was exhausted and not too worried about what I didn't understand or missed, just relieved that it was over.",3.5,5

The animation is gorgeous. What we see shouldn't be, but it looks beautiful. The style reminded me of The Clone Wars' animation, but I have to admit WALL-E looks like season 6 even though it came out the same year when season one of the show did.

Rotten Tomatoes,Scotty M,The Lives Of Others,"Review of The Lives of Others 

	The Lives of Others, directed by Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck, provides valuable insight into what life was like in East Berlin during the 1980s, while also being a wildly entertaining and well-made film. The plot follows Gerd Wiesler, a Stasi teacher and officer. The Stasi were the police force responsible for enforcing the harsh rules of East Germany. Wiesler was assigned to spy on a writer by the name of Georg Dreyman, who was suspected by the government to have values that aligned more with those of West Germany. Throughout his surveillance, Wiesler’s values and morals are challenged, leading him to question his allegiance to the Stasi. 

The film was beautifully put together by von Donnersmarck. Much of the appeal of the film was its complex characters, whose varying storylines were woven together to create a beautiful picture together. Our knowledge of the actions of many different characters in the film led to a very suspenseful viewing experience, since much of the plot was built around particular characters not knowing certain information about different characters. As a viewer, it was nerve-wracking to see different characters coming so close finding out details that would have greatly affected the trajectory of the movie. This inclined viewers to keep their full attention on the film, as it constantly felt as though the protagonists were seconds away from meeting their demise.  

In addition to the plot, the setting of East Berlin was beautifully replicated by the creators. One key aspect of the film was the constant gloomy lighting. There were practically zero moments in the film with any sort of bright lighting. This was useful in showing the sad and oppressive mood seen in East Germany. The camerawork in the film was also expertly done. Many of the shots included close-ups of the characters and slow panning, both of which helped to build suspense.  

Overall, The Lives of Others was an excellent film due to both its plot and filming techniques. The film has received a lot of praise in the media, including winning an Oscar for the best foreign language film. I think that this praise was warranted. I would recommend that everyone watches this movie. It brings entertainment and insight into East Germany together perfectly.",5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Kayla Jenia Courney H,The Lives Of Others,"Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck’s The Lives of Others is an impactful movie that tells a story about life under East Germany’s Stasi police state in the 1980s, and the unsettling mood of the film lingers long after it’s over. Using a tightly written script, and with subtle performances, the filmmakers work to be true to the paranoia and fear that infuses everything in a controlled society, but simultaneously capture the humanity that can also be found. 
The movie is based on the story of Captain Gerd Wiesler, a loyal Stasi member assigned to surveil a playwright and his actress girlfriend. Initially Wiesler is aligned with the regime’s unflinching enforcement of its laws; but ultimately, when he hears (and sees) the beauty, truth, and love of the playwright and his girlfriend – who is not present in his life – he begins a slow transformation of sorts. 
The transformation is revealed over the course of the movie, and one of the film's most poignant elements is that, other than some dialogue, Wiesler is silent. Ulrich Mühe fantastically implies empathetic change through facial expression and relaxed muscle movements. His transformation is convincing and devastating. It subtly demonstrates how art (and empathy) can affect even the most destructive loyalties. 
The singular experience of ‘The Lives of Others' is that the filmmakers do not allow the characters to forget their basic humanity or reduce anyone to a mere caricature. Wiesler's victims are imperfect, and the oppressors are more than just mustache-twirling villains. This kind of layered complexity adds to the emotional authenticity of the project as a whole.
A poignant stretch of action, in which Wiesler protects his target — the people he is spying on — is fraught with tension and also the weight of moral discovery — that people, even in systems that try to crush them, can choose decency. The muted colors and a more decisive pacing reflect the grey and controlled world of East Berlin. It may seem slow to some, but that pacing heightens the tension and mirrors the muted strangulation of the period. 
In sum, ‘The Lives of Others’ is not simply a historical drama, but a narrative of conscience, resistance, and lasting kindness. It stays with you long after the credits, insisting you ponder what it means to listen — and subsequently, to act.",4,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Daniel X,The Lives Of Others,"Sensitive, deep, and tense !  Very important to keeo us aware of something that was happening ""yesterday"", and is still happening today, but in different ways !",5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Tilman G,The Lives Of Others,"The Lives of Others is a visually masterfully staged work that captures the dark atmosphere of the GDR in an op- and impressive way. The craftsmanship of the film is remarkable (especially for a German film) and can compete with the best productions on an international level. Ulrich Mühe as Wiesler is absolutely outstanding. However, Wiesler's character development, especially with regard to his transformation, is not entirely convincing at times and is difficult to understand. Nevertheless, the film remains a touching, multi-layered drama about surveillance, morality and resistance to a totalitarian regime.",4.5,5

There are many points that logically fail in this movie. They made Vision essentially powerless through the whole movie, even though he possesses the mind stone, and why doesn’t iron man just cut off Thanos’s arm while he’s incapacitated by Mantis? And you’re telling me Thor can handle the full power of a star, staying conscious for at least a minute, but can’t beat Thanos at the beginning of the movie? Again, make it make sense.

Incredible action, huge cast where everyone gets their time to shine, and a villain, who is a top tier comic book movie antagonist! There’s barely any negatives here, with my only negative being that Bruce Banner feels underutilized again. However, when it comes to positives with more specifics, I love Tony and Peter Parker’s relationship in this movie and seeing their almost father/son bond. Also, splitting the groups into smaller sections was a great idea, as we see more unique pairings but also can flesh out the characters. Finally, the shocking ending is something that will never be topped, and is the perfect cliffhanger before a saga ending finale. 9.7/10",5,5

The film makes me feel like I understand the essence of this city, the film industry, and the people who live within it. And I did that without ever having been there. The dream factory thrives on the images it produces of itself. It's only fitting that images and films always depict a past moment, thus glorifying the past. Gloria Swanson is one of the most expressive film faces I've ever seen. ""Sunset Boulevard"" is always worth watching and, at 75 years old, is still relevant, funny, thrilling, and tragic.",5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Emma F,Sunset Boulevard,This film highlights the harsh realities of the film industry.,4.5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Jesse D,Sunset Boulevard,"A Haunting Masterpiece That Breathes with Decay and Desperation

If there’s a perfect classic film—one that defines Hollywood’s dark, glamorous, and tragic soul—it’s Sunset Boulevard. Everything about it seeps into your bones: the haunting cinematography, the air of faded grandeur, and the decayed beauty of Norma Desmond’s mansion, which feels less like a setting and more like a living, breathing character.

From the rotting tennis court to the rusted Isotta Fraschini gathering dust in the garage, you can almost smell the film’s atmosphere. Every inch of the frame radiates age and lost glory, a physical manifestation of Norma herself—once magnificent, now withering away in a delusional haze of silent film memories. That tangible decay is what makes Sunset Boulevard so immersive. You don’t just watch it; you feel it.

And at the center of it all is Gloria Swanson, who doesn’t just play Norma Desmond—she is Norma Desmond. Her every movement, every line, every flick of her fingers is infused with desperation, arrogance, longing, and madness. She’s wicked, tragic, grotesque, and mesmerizing all at once, commanding every frame with a performance so layered it becomes almost hypnotic. Her Norma is part grand dame, part ghost, part witch, and entirely unforgettable.

Billy Wilder’s direction is razor-sharp, the dialogue crackles, and the film’s bitter take on Hollywood’s cruelty remains just as relevant today. It’s a gothic horror story disguised as noir, a cautionary tale about fame’s fleeting nature, and a darkly poetic portrait of a woman who refuses to fade quietly.

If there’s one classic film that embodies everything I love about cinema—atmosphere so thick you can taste it, a performance that burns itself into your mind, and a story that lingers long after the final shot—it’s Sunset Boulevard. It’s not just a movie. It’s a spell.",5,5

The performances, particularly Gloria Swanson, are top notch. Sometimes I wonder why some of these noir era cinematographic techniques don't get used anymore because they just look so good. I highly recommend this movie.",5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Brennan W,Sunset Boulevard,"This film surprised me because I really didn't know what to expect. I like how much its centered around the movie business, especially when we look back at where things started. The main character being a screenwriter is different from what is seen in other films. This movie is beautiful for its time and really stands the test of time. Its characters are interesting and the film had me caring for them throughout. I enjoyed the film and learning more about the world of an early Hollywood, because its always nice to get many takes on what life was like. I would recommend this film to people especially interesting in noir stories, we don't get a whole lot like these anymore.",3,5
Rotten Tomatoes,anthony t,Sunset Boulevard,"This noir film was really interesting to watch. You follow a once highly praised silent actress who wants to ‘return’ to the film industry, and as her return is imminent, she hires someone to help her succeed with her plan. In which most people can somewhat resonate with this film, by wanting the help of someone at some given point of their life, trusting them, and from one day to another, you're being taken advantage of. We all have been through there, and it's a high connection that many of us, the viewers, can understand. However, the film itself was somewhat funny, well as for me it was. It was just interesting to see how the overall plot took a twist at the end with Nora’s new husband. Overall, it was a very enjoyable film which I would recommend to many. It's aesthetically beautiful, but the plot is funny, twisting, and questionable. I am highly sure many would enjoy it.",4.5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Miriam F,Sunset Boulevard,"Sunset Boulevard (Dir. Billy Wilder) is a noir/comedy centered around a screenwriter by the name of Joe Gillis. Financially struggling and with no work to do, Joe is trying to avoid finance men so that they won’t take away his car. In a somewhat dramatic chase, Joe pulls up into the driveway of a seemingly abandoned mansion in order to hide due to his flat tire. He enters the home which is owned by an old but once very popular silent movie star, Norma Desmond. Norma is not over her stardom and believes she can still make a return, not a comeback, as specified in the film. A return, “a return to the millions of people who have never forgiven me for deserting the screen.” Sunset Boulevard does a good job of portraying round characters and their intricate relationships. I did not find myself rooting for neither Norma nor Joe. I believe they both have faults and were simply trying to use each other. Norma wanted to make a return and so her opportunity literally walked in through her doors in the form of a screenwriter looking for work. Joe wanted work and Norma had the money to pay him. However, as where all things get twisted, Norma seeked Joe for more than his writing, she wanted Joe in a romantic sense and tried to buy him with gifts. Joe did not want this, he felt as if Norma was invading every aspect of his life when he only signed up to revise a script, not to move in with Norma, or the fancy suits, or the dancing. It took a second watch for me to realize how funny this film is despite the obvious noir elements. Even the way the film closes is such a “full circle” moment because her ex husband, who was a film director, is the one directing the closing scene. Out of all the films I’ve watched in my film study classes this one is high on the list of favorites.",5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Eliza B,Sunset Boulevard,"Sunset Boulevard is one of my favorite classics. The story, the acting, and the technical elements are all fantastic. I particularly enjoy the dynamic between Joe and Norma. While Norma is manipulative in making him stay, he makes his choice to stay with her himself. He is taken advantage of but he also reaps the benefits of her wealth and becomes comfortable within her lifestyle. The film is thrilling, Gloria Swanson perfectly encapsulates a vain and delusional washed up silent film star. The choice to show Joe dead at the very beginning of the film and have him narrating, telling the story of how he ended up dead in the pool was a groundbreaking move in storytelling and pays off, building up suspense throughout the movie. While Norma is ultimately responsible for her actions, it isn’t difficult to sympathize with or at least try to understand how she got to where she did. Many of the characters in the film enable or feed into her delusions, in particular her butler and former director, Max. DeMille also feeds into her delusions, entertaining her belief that she will come back and be in another of his movies. The film shows a darker side of Hollywood, contrasting the dreams of the washed up star with the dreams of the eager screenwriter. In the end, Joe gets what he originally wanted, fame and fortune, but it comes at the cost of his life. Norma also gets what she wants, a chance to relive her glory days and have her face on the screen again.",5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Yeet 1,Sunset Boulevard,"I thought Sunset Boulevard was overall an ok film. The sort of weird romance/sugar baby relationship with Norma Desmond and Joe Gillis. It is interesting how they show how fragile Norma Desmond's mental health actually is during the ending when she seems to go into a VERY manic mental state. She is so crazy she actually shoots Joe after she thinks he is cheating on her. It also seems that the one thing that is keeping her sane is actually Joe and her belief that she is still popular that keeps her from absolutely losing it. She also seems very much stuck in the 20s, actually the whole film seems very stuck in the 20s despite being made in 1950.

It is also the film responsible for making the cliche of the main character explaining how they got into an awkward predicament. For example you can see this in the beginning of megamind. Megamind is kind of a role reversal of Sunset Boulevard just without the sugar baby part of the relationship. 

I think that Max was wrong for feeding into Norma’s delusions for so long. This is because it made her so unstable that her mental health was so fragile that pretty much anything would make her snap. It just kept her in this weird echo chamber where she was so sequestered away from the world where it just made her mentally worse. It also is keeping her away from a possible support network that is not made up of Max or Joe. Lastly Max’s actions eventually ended in the death of Joe so that's also a thing to add on top of that.",3.5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Nyla E,Sunset Boulevard,"I didn’t know what to expect when first watching Sunset Boulevard, I won’t lie I was afraid I would get bored but I was far from it when watching. I don’t think I’ve heard anything about this film before watching it, but I was so surprised. What this film does brilliantly is it speaks on the harsh reality of society’s perspective of older women. The character, Norma Desmond, we pity her and cringe at how desperate she is to be in the limelight again. In the film, because we follow the perspective of Joe Gillis, who sees her as a crazy washed up film star that is delusional in living in her glory days. The audience sees her in this way too. But what is really being said is the harsh reality that women have to deal with as she grows older. Hollywood and society believe that women lose their value as they start to show that they’re getting older. The standards for women are different, if a man gets older he’s still valued and is the much wiser. When a woman grows older, shes expected to step aside for newer, younger, hungrier women. I think its important for a person to see this film at least once in their life, its truly brilliant on speaking on this topic and I feel that there is no other film that speaks it so plainly as Sunset Boulevard does. The same could be said for Joe Gillis’ character as well, what happens when Hollywood has decided that a writer is no longer needed because his material is “stale.” This film, speaks on the dispensability of people in Hollywood. That each person can be easily replaced with newer, brighter and fresher ideas, which is a harsh and cruel truth of Hollywood that is especially relevant to today.",5,5

Rotten Tomatoes,Eric D,Sunset Boulevard,"Billy Wilder's iconic film Sunset Boulevard has very interesting characters with depths of psychology and gives a very hard critique of Hollywood's darker side. The industry is shown to be brutal and exploitative rather than attractive, which is a concept that I enjoy and is still relevant in today's industry. The cast of characters, each likable in their own special and sometimes imperfect ways, is what really sticks out to me in the entire movie. Norma Desmond, an emotional heroine caught in her past, is likable despite her delusions. She attempts to control Joe via riches by providing him with material luxuries like jewelry, clothing, and a luxury lifestyle in an effort to keep him around. Joe, on the other hand, knows this, but he is also hooked by Norma's comfort, which causes him to stay until the end. The psychological depth of both characters elevates the film, making it more than just a critique of Hollywood. It shows us the fragile egos, the desperation, and the moral compromises people make to survive in the industry. Even though this film is a dark comedy at heart, it feels strikingly real and contemporary, especially in its exploration of power dynamics and relevance. While a few scenes may feel slow or boring, the film remains entertaining throughout, showcasing its influence on countless Hollywood-centered films that followed. Wilder’s exploration of the darker sides of fame and ambition continues to be both relevant and captivating. Overall, I believe it's worth watching this film because it lets you freely create your own opinions on the characters and the whole industry itself.",4,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Farah R,Paths Of Glory,Kubrick’s war drama is impactful and well-acted. Too bad it’s outdated for an audience in 2025.,3,5
Rotten Tomatoes,William B,Paths Of Glory,Masterpiece. Like many others of Kubrick.,5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Jay W,Paths Of Glory,"Although this film is primarily seen as a war film, it may find more in common with a courtroom drama. It is 1916 in France in the heart of a battle in World War I. General Mireau wants to capture part of the battlefield known as ""The Ant Hill"". He tells Col. Dax to capture the Ant Hill. The general figures that he will only lose roughly...65% of his men in the venture. As the men go to capture this hill, they find the task impossible and can't progress passed the first trench. This displeases General Mireau and he wants to charge them for cowardice.

The villain can be a tad too over the top. He makes the mayor from ""Jaws"" look subtle. It weakens the theme because of how extreme he is.

Unlike so many other Stanley Kubrick films, this one is very straight forward. It is a tight 88-minute runtime. It follows a simple 3 act structure with a clear protagonist and antagonist. It is decisively un- pretentious, but that isn't to imply that the movie has nothing to say. It is a poignant and engaging tale and should be seen.

It deserves all the glory it gets.",4,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Jakob F,Paths Of Glory,"An arresting examination of bureaucracy’s futility and man’s propensity to be corrupted by power takes centerstage to the backdrop of World War I’s stagnant trench warfare, more specifically: following through in executing a fruitless military operation is set up as the antithesis of cowardice and insubordination, sticking it’s protagonists between a rock and a hard place.",4,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Daniel N,Paths Of Glory,"I'd never seen such a smart storytelling with a perfect characters development, ‘Paths of glory’ makes itself honor to his name, it is just too ridiculous that Stanley Kubrick was even able to think in this story and write it down in a script to give us all a film masterclass.",5,5

The ground breaking camera work separates this film from its contemporaries. Kirk Douglas in what might be his best performance, leads his soldiers and we the viewers down a unbelievable path that's gut wrenching and heart breaking.

This is only my third Stanley Kubrick movie, but this was by far the best of the three so far. This is in fact, one of the best war films ever made, it shows once again, the endless pain that comes with war. Kirk Douglas is quickly becoming an actor, I must see more of, because he is absolutely fantastic in this movie, I didn't even feel he was acting the whole time, it felt like a documentary. The war scenes are gripping and hold up really well technically for a movie out of 1957. The story is painful to watch, how one human, can do this to another human, the way that people completely lose their mind in the middle of it all. This movie really makes you think twice, about the meaning of it all, why in gods name are we killing each other, only because people in higher demand order it. The way that this movie isn't your typical trench war movie, but it follows a whole other aspect of the war, that is just insane to even understand, why it is happening in the first place. The ending was absolutely fantastic and made me cry, the way that in the whole chaos of war, the whole disturbing war, that even then, people can find the best in each other and have a moment of joy, even if it means going back into the trenches, horrifying movie, an experience I will never forget!",5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Ben D,Paths Of Glory,"No war makes for better anti-war movies than World War I, not even Vietnam. Instead of the meat-grinder, disregard for human life showcased on the German side in the phenomenal 2022 version of All Quiet on the Western Front, Stanley Kubrick takes us to the French side, where a company neglects suicidal orders to advance on a German position after watching the company before them get completely annihilated. Our hero, Colonel Dax (Kirk Douglas), fails in his attempts to rally his company and a falling soldier knocks him unconscious. All of this death and destruction was so one man could receive a promotion. Although the orders to bomb their own men as a sort of crop whip are not carried out, three soldiers, one from each disobedient company, are to be selected to be court-martialed for cowardice — the first two allotments of 100 and then a dozen are whittled down to just three (Joe Turkel, Timothy Carey, Wayne Morris), which makes it a more intimate story. The bloodbath here is in the military tribunal courtroom — obscenely located in a baroque chateau — where a kafkaesque farce of justice takes place. The men are to be made examples of, despite Colonel Dax's best efforts at defending them — he was a lawyer during peacetime. Colonel Dax wages a futile campaign against the Generals (Adolphe Menjou & George Macready) who are representative of the insane military system itself. The best visuals come from Dax marching through the trenches flanked by his men and the execution by firing squad, which includes shooting an incapacitated man (Turkel) in yet one more moment of absurdism. The final scene concerning the French jackals goading the German woman forced to sing (Susanne Christian, who will later become Kubrick's wife), only to be placated once she hits the middle of the folk song, portrays a humanity still wedged within the soldiers yearning to break free. But what Colonel Dax does after he returns to his chambers is up for interpretation: Will he continue to defy orders in the name of sanity or has he become one more cog in the machine? This is a short, but powerful anti-war movie that is often overlooked and buried in Kubrick's unequaled filmography.",4.5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,johnathon w,Paths Of Glory,"Brilliant anti-war film that stands as Kubrick's first true classic.  The cast is superb across the board, with the late, great Kirk Douglas delivering an outstanding lead performance as Col. Dax, a true hero trying to save the lives of innocent soldiers despite the bureaucracy surrounding them.  The character is a rarity among Kubrick films, who rarely had real heroes in his films.  Behind the camera, Stanley Kubrick brilliantly adapts the novel in to a stark anti-war picture, showing how officers who never see the dangers of combat can call enlisted men cowards who must face it.  Its brutal and unrelenting, standing as one of the best anti-war films ever.  A true classic.",5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Thomas V,Paths Of Glory,"Not at all like most other war movies of its time, this is a pretty scathing indictment of the authorities that send ordinary men off to their deaths with such callousness.

Rotten Tomatoes,Sarfaraz A,Witness For The Prosecution,"The director of this courtroom drama about a mystery crime was Billy Wilder. Charles Laughton, Tyrone Power, and Marlene Dietrich are the main stars in the film. The film is based on Agatha Christie's 1953 play of the same name. The movie was nominated for several Academy Awards.

Set at London's Old Bailey, Sir Wilfrid (Charles) is a senior barrister who has recently been discharged from hospital owing to health concerns and is accompanied by a nurse to care for his health and administer medication on time. Wilfrid's doctor has barred him from taking on cases, particularly murder cases that might have an impact on his health. However, he quickly takes on the case of defending a former war veteran who is suspected of murdering an old woman he had been meeting and is claimed to have received a large sum of money in a recently found bequest.

The film employs bleak humorous dialogues, largely delivered by Charles Laughton. The plot features fantastic legal debate and is perhaps one of the legal movies I've seen in which the whole film is exclusively around the defense analyzing the complexities of the case and how to handle it. Charles Laughton is the only driving force in the film, making it worthwhile to see. Billy Wilder handles Agatha Christie's play in a satisfactory manner, keeping the mystery alive all the way until the finale, which gives three victories and one victory that lives very briefly.",4.5,5

I was never a big fan of Agatha Christie preferring Raymond Chandler when discussing crime. If you like this more polished presentation it is a movie that you will enjoy.

Rotten Tomatoes,Josh A,Shining,"Where do I even begin with this movie. It's a very simple story that mostly consists of a man going insane and trying to kill his family, but it's an example of a simple story with spectacular execution. Also to address the elephant in the room, yes, I know it's different to the book. I don't really care if it's different to the book and it's still similar enough to be a decent adaptation. Let's get into the film itself.

The story, as previously mentioned, is simple. There's a sense that something deeper going on that we don't see and it adds mystery to the story. Maybe the hotel is corrupting Jack, maybe it isn't. There's also the plotline with Danny and the Shine, which isn't as important as it is in the novel and miniseries, but it's done well and the visions are interesting.

But where this movie truly shines is Jack Nicholson's portrayal of Jack Torrance. This movie's version of Jack is more aggressive and angry than the novel's version, but he's more subtly angry near the start. You can see seeds of anger when Wendy interrupts his work and in the scenes where you can sense something's bubbling inside him, but then he lets loose and it is amazing. Wow. Also, even though Kubrick said that the ending scene shows that Jack was a reincarnation of someone who used to work at the hotel, I interpreted it as Jack being absorbed by the hotel and being stuck in limbo with the other ghosts. It's more haunting and I just like the idea of it.

Overall, a fantastic movie and, essentially, Kubrick's interpretation of Stephen King's novel.",5,5

Ridiculous it’s the greatest horror of all time and if you doubt it go back in time to when it was made before you got bored to death watching every horror film ever made since and you will realise wow this film is a masterpiece! It’s before all those haunted house films that ripped it off for decades and actually if I was watching this as a kid in the 80’s on tv at night just before school I wouldn’t be able to sleep at night ! Those twins would make  me wake up screaming ! Now once you put this film into that 1980’s I’m a kid watching it for the first time before I was desensitised by 1200 horror films since before I saw people cutting off heads and CGI monsters then in that context this is the scariest film ever and as a product of its time you can’t compare it to films today because it invented those films by influencing the directors of those movies , Films like the Changeling and the Shining they don’t need to be reviewed on rotten tomatoes they were reviewed by proper experts back in the days we had them before every Tom dick and Harry went on YouTube and gave an un qualified opinion",5,5

This 5’5 lil gangster directed, wrote, produced, and composed the score (not to mention playing both of the main characters) for the single greatest comedic film ever made, and he did it all at a time when Gandhi was still alive. The comedy of this film is beyond brilliant. Blending a dry subtlety with bouts of ferocious slapstick is no easy task, but harder still is tackling such prickly material (especially in his time) with such an exuberance of nuanced confidence that you ground everything in wondrous character work, build your farce upon that storytelling, and then deploy character and conversation driven comedy as the catalyst for the satirical goal. This film is a culmination of everything that comedy ought to be. Phenomenally directed, with a message that (while obviously relevant in all eras) spoke transcendent volumes in 1940, “The Great Dictator” not only features perhaps the greatest monologue in the history of film, but also contains one of the greatest performances I’ve ever seen from any actor, ever.

And the best remedy is to just laugh at how ridiculous it is. Really the only issue the music is really good but not super memorable on it's own or catchy. Everything else is masterfully done. Chaplin's physical acting, playing two characters, and his end speech are just masterful and above all else funny and engaging. It feels like a silent film weaved together with a Lubitsch film. The jokes always get a chuckle or are very clever even though I never laughed hysterically like Airplane type jokes. It's always funny, clever, engaging, and has plenty of gags and visual scenes I haven't ever seen before. All of it is worth it to get to the end speech and man....does it hit hard.

Rotten Tomatoes,John B,Great Dictator,"A Political Satire where Charlie Chaplin displays his skill with Talkies
By; John Byrne

The Great Dictator by Charlie Chaplin, was Chaplin's first production with synced sound. Despite being the first he performed very well in both of his roles as the antisemitic dictator and the Jewish barber. Filled with physical comedy he was known for, that I found shared similarities with The Three Stooges I was laughing at the slapstick comedy as much as the political satire. This film was first released in 1940 just after the start of WWII, but Chaplin like many across the world were aware of Adolf Hitler's rise to power in the 1930s and the antisemitic rhetoric that he campaigned and grew popular on. This film ridiculed Adolf Hitler, Nazis and antisemitism. In his role as both actor, writer and director Chaplin created a masterpiece that has stood the test of time. Watching it today in 2023 I drew many similarities to our American election in 2016 and 2020 and the presidency of Donald Trump as well as the rise in nationalist politicians across the world. The film was relevant at the time not only because WWII had just started but because America had not yet entered the war.
Having watched Napoleon Dynamite recently I found similarities in the use of comedy to deliver a powerful message. Napoleon Dynamite attended a school where some groups of kids made fun of and bullied other students, Napoleon among the students that were bullied. Some of these students would use derogatory terms when talking about Napoleons new friend, a new student and of Mexican descent. Napoleon's home life wasn't much better, he lived with a mother that would leave for a week or more an older brother that bullied him and an uncle that also bullied him. In this film we see it resolve by Napoleon conquering some of his own anxieties and playing tetherball with the girl he likes. In The Great Dictator the movie ends with the Jewish Barber assume the role of dictator in a comedic twist of events. Both movies known for their use of one liners and social impact at the time of release. 
I would recommend this movie to everyone, going into the movie I had few expectations, but I knew I Charlie Chaplin was a legend to come out of the silent film era. I was pleased to hear dialogue between the characters and the film was comedic enough to keep me entertained throughout. Despite being about such a serious topic the movie was overall still very funny.",3.5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Sean D,Great Dictator,"""… it'll carry weight"" ""You mean I will carry weight HAHAHA.""
	
In 2023 making jokes about any subject matter that is painful for anyone is widely considered offensive. But I grew up in the 1990s so that type of stuff doesn't bother me. I am a former standup comedian and a current fan of all things comedy… with that said this movie was an absolute masterpiece. I can understand how some people might watch this movie and be offended… and to those people I say ""why is your life so sad? Get it together you bum.""
""The Great Dictator"" written, directed, starring, and produced by the great Charlie Chaplin is the story of a Jewish Barber who suffered amnesia at the end of World War I, returning home a fictional country (Tomainia) who was on the losing end of that war. It takes place roughly 20 years after the end of the war and because of the barber's traumatic brain injury he does not know how much time has passed thinking he has only been away from his beloved Barber shop for only a couple of weeks. I have always heard about this movie but never made the time to see it because I normally find old comedies to be very of the time, and I don't generally find that entertaining. The great dictator was released in 1940 so it sat in the category of movies I would actively avoid. But I did know a general background of the movie… it's supposed to lampoon Adolf Hitler and the rise of the Nazi party in Germany before World War II (electric boogaloo). I had very low expectations for how funny I would find this movie, and the one thing that stood out to me in the first 25 minutes were the similarities to movies written and directed by Mel Brooks such as Blazing Saddles and Spaceballs. Spaceballs was a very silly movie with no real message attached to it, blazing saddles on the other hand is very much in the same vein as the great dictator where it tackles a very painful very dark depressing social issue in racism. The great dictator tackles anti-Semitism head on showing just how terrible the lives of the Jews in the ghetto work but masterfully weaves in humor not to dull the message but in an effort to make the viewing experience more enjoyable. Charlie Chaplin is unquestionably the biggest star of the silent movie era and that's evident throughout this movie there are certain scenes where chaplain leans heavily on physical comedy that you might see in a silent movie but on the other side of the coin, he also uses very effective joke delivery verbally. Near the beginning of the movie there is a scene where the Barber gets into a fight with a pair of the stormtroopers (the movies depiction fo the SS). During the scuffle he ends up getting hit on the head and does a very silent movie era over sell of being hit where he stumbles up and down the street going on and off the curb which I found very funny. But again it's not just silent movie error humor that he uses, for example the title of this review... Chaplain who also played the dictator Hynkel is speaking to Garbitsch (pronounced garbage) and he suggests that high goal dance with the wife of a neighboring dictator to help insert dominance over him, telling him that ""it will carry weight"". Knowing this woman they are speaking about is an overweight lady Hynkel's response of ""You mean I will carry weight"" is absolute gold. 
The social impact of this movie can't be understated. As stated, the great dictator was released in 1940, which was before the United states even entered World War II. Meaning that the knowledge of the mistreatment of Jews by the Nazis in Germany was widespread. The courage it took for Charlie Chaplin to take such a thinly veiled shot at such a powerful dictator is something that should be admired. But at the same time the ability to make that shot powerful as well as entertaining was absolutely amazing.
I give this movie 9 fat dictator wives out of 10.",4.5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Saif A,Great Dictator,"The Great Dictator was released in 1940. It was written and directed by the great Charles Chaplin himself. He also starred in the movie alongside Paulette Goddard and Jack Oakie. The movie was satire and it made fun of the Nazis and Hitler. It was about a dictator who wanted to kill all the Jews and dominate the world only to be mistaken for a barber and have that same barber, who escaped a concentration camp, replace him and end the war and the misery that he had caused. The great performance of Charlie Chaplin is one of the biggest reasons why the movie was successful.  
I watched this movie for the first time today and I have never heard of it before this week. I was not expecting much from it when I started watching the movie. I know about Chaplin as everyone else. My expectation was that this movie would be a silent film where Chaplin does all those same stunts and acts funny. When I watched the actual movie, I realized that this was critique of the mindset of dictators like Hitler and it made all the ideas and the uniforms as well as everything the Nazis stood for sound very silly.  
Chaplin was up to his old comedy tricks which were funny. But, he also showed great acting and range to go from the funny to the serious and inspiring in the same movie. He was playing two different characters in the movie. One could say that he carried the movie by himself. 
The movie touches on the issue of racism towards Jews and other minorities. This is a similar them to what we see in Spike Lee's Do the Right Thing. The difference is that the historical contexts are different with The Great Dictator coming in the time of World War II when the Holocaust was going on. 
My recommendation would be to see this movie for sure. I am surprised that nobody has mentioned this to me before now. It is a great movie.",4,5
Rotten Tomatoes,,Great Dictator,"I am making a post review for my class.

 In the movie the Great Dictator directed by Charlie Chapman who was also one of the main actors as a barber owner who lived in the Ghetto in Germany tries to bring humor during a horrible time in history by going against the storm troopers and the famous Hinkel who was Adolf Hitler who was also played by Charlie Chapman. During that time Hitler was killing and executing Jewish people because of there Ethnic and religious beliefs background as a Jew. Charlie Chapman was able to bring some humor and happiness to the people thru film with the help of some of the following his friend Hannah played by Paulette Goddard she lived next store to the barber shop he worked at and became real close. As well as Schultz played by Reginald Gardner who was saved by Chaplain  by guiding is plane out of harms way against the enemy little did he know they would be come great friends and who also help bring humor to the film. On the side of fence there was some great humor with some actors such as Herring who is played by Bill Gilbert and who was one of Hinkel right hand man

 There was a scene in the movie thought was funny when he was trying to show Hinkel some stuff he was working on with scientists and they all failed one included a man jumping out the window and he fell which I thought was funny because he was suppose to fly. Thru Charlie film he showed people what was going on in there country and the movie even made it way to the US and was broadcasted and released around 1940 (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0032553/releaseinfo/).",4,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Jackson G,Great Dictator,"""The Great Dictator"" is one of those films that sneaks up on you. What may be easily passed off as ""just another old movie"" can quickly become one of the most influential films you've ever watched. This cinematic gem was directed, written, and produced by none other than THE legendary Charlie Chaplin. This iconic piece takes a bold leap into the realms of political satire, and even eight decades after its release, it is still a powerful statement against totalitarianism, wrapped in Chaplin's iconic brand of humor. 

The film is set against the bleak backdrop of the 1930s, a period marked by the rise of Adolf Hitler and the looming threat of another great war. Chaplin, in dual roles, plays one Adenoid Hynkel, who is a ruthless dictator who is an obvious portrayal of Hitler, and a Jewish barber who is eventually mistaken for Hynkel. The climax of the mix-up sets the stage for a hilarious but poignant exploration of identity, power, and humanity. 

The film stands out for its bold social justice message. In a time when the world was grappling with the horrors of fascism, Chaplin used his platform to highlight the absurdity and cruelty of totalitarian regimes. I think his portrayal of Hynked as a bumbling, megalomaniacal leader is comical and at times thought-provoking. As I was watching the film, I drew parallels to things that I read about Hitler, and like when watching Hynkel I caught myself thinking, ""Who would follow this guy?."" Historically speaking, the film is a snapshot of the world on the brink of war. Chaplin's decision to release ""The Great Dictator"" in 1940, when the United States had not yet entered the conflict, was a courageous move. It was a call to action and a plea for the world to unite against tyranny. I think it was exactly the film that the world needed to lay the mental groundwork needed to start standing up to the looming threat of the Nazi regime. The film's closing speech, delivered by Chaplin as the Jewish barber, remains one of the most powerful moments in cinematic history, advocating for peace, democracy, and human dignity. Because of the political setting at the time of its release, you know that when Chaplin delivers his monologue, he's speaking to every single person watching the film. He was, at that moment, not playing a part in a film but begging the world for help in his moral fight. 

Chaplin's cinematic devices set this film apart from commercial movies of its time. The film seamlessly combines humor and satire with moments of genuine, tear-jerking emotion. The usage of sharp editing and Chaplin's physical comedy prowess creates a unique blend of entertainment and social commentary. The globe-balloon dance scene is a testament to Chaplin's ability to convey complex ideas through physical humor. 

When comparing ""The Great Dictator"" to Spike Lee's ""Do the Right Thing"", you're able to draw interesting parallels in their use of cinema as a tool for social justice. While both films use humor to address issues, they do so in different contexts. ""Do the Right Thing"" explores racial tensions in a contemporary urban setting, whereas ""The Great Dictator"" tackles the timely and global issue of fascism. Both movies challenge the audience to confront uncomfortable truths about society, making them essential works in the cinematic canon. 

In conclusion, ""The Great Dictator"" remains an unparalleled masterpiece in the realm of satire. Charlie Chaplin's vision and artistry shine through and deliver a timeless message of hope and humanity. This movie is essential for anyone looking for a source of inspiration, and if you don't have the time to watch the entire thing, the speech at the end is worth a YouTube search in itself.",5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,jiahua q,Great Dictator,"The film tells the story of World War I when the dictator Singer of the Kingdom came to power. His massive expansion led to constant wars and deprived the people of their livelihood. Moreover, he carried out conspiracy policies and plunged the Jewish people into dire catastrophe. Charlie, a Jewish barber who was conscripted into the army, could not escape such a high-pressure policy. When Charlie escaped from the border, he was mistaken for the dictator Zinger by the troops stationed here. He took the opportunity to make a "" Fight for Freedom"" speech.
The ignorant and cruel dictator and the kind-hearted barber with amnesia are the same character. Now of the dictator's final speech, the roles were reversed by mistake. Not only Chaplin himself longed for true change, but people with conscience also longed for: standing on the stage, wearing a mustache, a war madman with extraordinary energy, it would be great if he was a guy with kind feelings and compassion.
The film was written, directed, and acted by comedy master Charlie Chaplin. It was the first sound film created against the background of the German Nazi Party's accelerated expansion and mass murder of Jews after World War II. It was released in the United States on October 15, 1940. It satirizes the ugly acts of Hitler, the German Nazi leader, who massacred the Jews, and expresses his desire for democracy and freedom.
Chaplin's performance is very good, it can be said that it is full of passion. His nervous expressions and exaggerated movements make people watch it endlessly. It is completely different from ordinary comedies that make people want to laugh and watch twice. gimmick.
The film's supporting cast performs well. Propaganda Minister Gabezhi has a gloomy expression, is good at catering to the dictator, and plays tricks, which can be called the reappearance of the character prototype. Another heroine who is often mentioned is said to be the only character in Zhuo's works who has a sense of female autonomy, but she did not leave much impression on me.
In 1936, movies began to have sound. Later, not only sound but also color video was developed. This is Chaplin's classic work that touches on sound films. Although Chaplin once abandoned sound and entered movies, the tide of the times is irreversible, and new technologies will inevitably bring new ways of expression. It can be said that the artistic value and political value of this film have reached the highest altitude of a comedy.",5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Miss  S,Great Dictator,"Un poco larga, pero no estuvo mal del todo",2,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Matthew B,Great Dictator,"From the perspective of 2020, The Great Dictator may seem like a sure success. It was a film mocking Adolf Hitler during a period of wartime. A look at the box office returns would reveal this to be Charlie Chaplin's most commercially successful film. From this point onwards, his career would struggle.

Yet when Chaplin began work on The Great Dictator, its popularity was not assured. World War 2 had not yet began, and the British government was already offering to ban the film while they pursued an ill-advised policy of appeasement with Nazi Germany. Even by the time the film was finished, most Americans favoured staying out of the war.

What Chaplin realised was that the absurd behaviour of Adolf Hitler could easily be worked into one of his own comic characters. Chaplin drew on Triumph of the Will to mimic Hitler's mannerisms. To Chaplin, Hitler and Mussolini were posturing buffoons and ranting egomaniacs. Like their counterparts in the movie, they were little more than theatrical actors strutting around the world stage.

Chaplin also renders Hitler's speeches into a pseudo-Germanic nonsensical language that is so guttural it makes the dictator cough. The obedience of Hitler's followers does not go unnoticed. With one gesture of his hand, Chaplin's dictator cuts off their cheers and applause. It is said that Hitler himself watched The Great Dictator twice. It is hard not to wonder what he thought of it.

Charlie Chaplin had heard about the conditions of the Jewish people in Germany from friends of his, and he wished to make a stand on the issue. Amusingly enough, Chaplin himself had come in for anti-Semitic comments from the Nazis, and he was not even Jewish.

At the time, it was felt that Chaplin went too far in his portrayal of Jewish ghettos under Nazism. Nowadays, we would probably feel that he could have gone a lot further. The full horror of what was happening in Germany was not yet known, and worse was to follow as the war progressed. Later Chaplin said that he would not have made the film if he had known how bad things were in Germany.

Nonetheless Chaplin did not pull punches, and his portrayal of troopers storming through the Jewish ghetto is strangely disquieting for a comedy. The soldiers smash windows, burn down buildings, steal from Jewish traders and shoot a man who opposes them. Chaplin's character is nearly hanged from a lamp post. Concentration camps are mentioned.

The Great Dictator was the first movie that Charlie Chaplin made entirely in sound. There are moments of the old visual and slapstick humour that we associate with Chaplin – the unexploded bomb that keeps rotating every time our hero tries to defuse it, an upside-down plane ride, and the sight of Chaplin comically out of step with his fellow soldiers, until finally he ends up walking alongside the enemy after getting lost in the fog.

Perhaps the most beautiful visual moment is one where Chaplin's dictator plays with a giant globe. The scene provides a comical take on his megalomaniacal ambitions, but it is also a brief moment of balletic elegance. Then the globe bursts, just like the tyrant's dreams.

Talking forms a greater part of Chaplin's humour for the first time though, and it must be noted that the comedy which seemed so innocent in the silent films looks a little broader here. This can be seen in the names of the leading Nazi characters. Chaplin plays Adenoid Hynkel, the somewhat less than great dictator of Tomainia (an old word for food-poisoning).

There is some discussion about whether the Jewish Barber is another incarnation of The Tramp, Chaplin's most famous creation. He is not called so, and he does have a job for much of the film. Then again, The Tramp occasionally finds work. There is at least a kinship between the two men in their basic personalities. Both have no name, both are clumsy and accident-prone, both are gallant towards women, and both are essentially kind-hearted.

The Great Dictator ends with a famous speech that divides opinions. The Jewish Barber expresses hope for a better future in terms that are rousing and idealistic, or naïve and sentimental, depending on your taste.

The movie stands out as a film of great courage and defiance, packed with scenes of great hilarity, and yet leavened with a serious message that resonates today.

Rotten Tomatoes, ,Quel Maledetto Treno Blindato,"A fun film, classically told in Tarantino’s style. Couldn’t quite get behind some of the things that happen in the story, and I didn’t love everything about Brad Pitt’s performance (or maybe it’s because they tried to have him speak Italian with some type of thick Southern drawl). Overall, would recommend the film for more mature audiences. The language is “thick” as usual. There’s a bit of an unnecessary but not very revealing brief sex scene (more given as a flashback background on a couple of characters). Christoph Waltz is pretty solid. Daniel Brühl always seems to deliver a solid performance, and this is no exception. Mélanie Laurent is excellent.",4,5

In regards to the 1978 enactment, throughout my experience watching the older version, the soundtrack didn't strike me as exciting, thumb twirling or notable at all.

Rotten Tomatoes, ,Quel Maledetto Treno Blindato,"The Inglorious Bastards (1978): More polished than you'd expect from a macaroni war exploitation piece, with an assorted cast (with equally assorted levels of acting talent) annihilating anyone in their path - even, accidentally, the good guys. Peter Hooten is, perhaps, the most intriguing of the titular team but there's enough character diversity here to ensure broad appeal amongst its target male audience. (It was even re-edited and released as 'G.I. Bro' to present Fred Williamson as the lead for the blaxploitation market.)

The characters are super memorable and it's so impressive for such a large amount of characters. It moves at a perfect pace and it's emotional climax is so well earned and universally resonates. Even if you can see the twist coming in this it just hits so well and is so well done it doesn't matter at all. As much as this is about a cool trip to a fantasy world of the dead.

This movie perfectly blends the Día de los Muertos festival with themes of family bonding and music. 


The filming is very beautiful, especially in the Land of the Dead scene, with the vibrant colors and thoughtful details. It’s so stunning! For the first time that I have watched this, I was a bit tricked. There is some twist in this movie, just like classic Pixar style. The plot presents about family blends with Mexican culture in touching way. That made me feel truly connected to the Día de los Muertos festival celebration of life.

Rotten Tomatoes,Jacob B,Amadeus,"A fascinating dramatic comedy that is a very deft portrayal of the artistic process —and all the envy, pride and ego that go hand in hand with that process . The author (of both the play and the screenplay) simply uses a highly fictionalized Mozart as a springboard for his mediation on the art, the artist, and their world. Thankfully, he is not interested in writing a factual biography of the musical genius. This beautiful, tragic fiction is far more interesting.",4.5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,AnActor E,Amadeus,"Amadeus was written by the wonderful playwright Peter Shaffer, who I met in Manhattan as an acting student. A kind and charming old man, he was moved to tears by the then premiere of his niece’s play. Shaffer’s works involve a great deal of practical dialogue, and we often cold read them to each other in class. The success of Amadeus onstage lead to the film adaptation; an enduring production criticized for its historical inaccuracies. It’s true that this film takes liberties with what we know of Mozart, but I believe that creativity enriches the movie, especially since we’re informed this is fiction.

Amadeus’s introduction oozes character and vulnerability, quickly enchanting the viewer. F. Murray Abraham is completely invested in his part, and the passion with which he works is inspiring. Tom Hulce devised his character’s unusual laugh, which you will hear in the film. His portrayal is boisterous and energetic! In order to trigger genuine feelings in an audience, an actor must honestly live the script’s moments as if they were his own genuine experiences. While watching this film, notice how natural the actors appear: their poses are ordinary and their gestures mundane. You can recognize their feelings because they aren’t embellishing.

Every aspect of this film is peak cinema and among the highest quality that Hollywood achieves. The acting, at times, may feel very eighties, due to lack of European accents and the American ensemble. This is, however, a small defect in an otherwise flawless film. Amadeus teaches us how love becomes envy due to wounded pride, how we often see others as a threat, and how very destructive we can be to each other. Winner of endless accolades and eight Academy awards, Amadeus is essential cinema and a timeless classic.",4.5,5

And the best part of the movie was how real antonio Salieri felt. The hatred he had in his heart felt real, and the envy he felt for Mozart made him relatable. Both his young and old self was interesting, relatable, and human. The music was excellent. And the plot worked. Mozart felt like a genius child prodigy who was immature. Who was controlled by his father until he married and became man out of his depths with his marriage.",5,5

Rotten Tomatoes,Kyle M,Amadeus,"Ever gave a film a second chance, and found the viewing somehow more enjoyable? During my early venturing in broadening my filmic horizons, I approached Milos Forman’s 1984 Academy Award Best Picture winner “Amadeus” out of both recommendation amid the categorical trek, only to find it distastefully overwhelming with production merits in the aesthetic edges. Through many discoveries and attended film studies since high school through college, not only my appreciation for film gotten more opened but also critically sharpened as noted with some revisitations receiving corrected ratings with flaws and qualities seen much clearer than before. Opportunely prompted, “Amadeus” is a periodical art worth revisiting, tolerably backed up more critically. Its very form remains intact and admittedly turned out better, by a slight margin.

As a young lad, Antonio Salieri became aspired, determined and disciplined to pursue a path as a composer who would give back to the deity he prayed to with apparent spiritual loyalty at grateful heights. He soon admired and learned from other sounds across some chords, with one of them being Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart’s divine and miraculous music that surpasses his own. For a hardworking devout he’s become, Salieri is shocked to witness Mozart’s true personality outside the orchestra platform: vulgar in frolicking with others, and free-spirited in deflecting societal seriousness. This unexpected discovery, though personal for Mozart, who shows unworthy stature behind a genius push Salieri further into disbelief on why God favored Mozart over his devoted prayer, eventually becoming a religious enemy as vengefully turned his back with obsessive envy in sabotaging his rival’s downfall. The devious unorthodox scheme he puts into play becomes a pretentious friendship that Mozart would cherish, blinded by the deception that would seal the fate for both men who sought through their passions only to be blindsided costly.

Forman was concerned about the film’s exposure during the culture’s transfiguration regarding tastes in music becoming further appealing to younger generations – as the industrial demographics filtered more youthfully in passing eras. The period drama strives artistically and aesthetically with evident objective ambitions indulging in elaborative designs with natural lighting, consisting of a meticulously sensed one-sided rivalry and elegant discourse in the mixture of passionate creativity conflictingly challenging strict norms (recent viewing of “Chevalier” provoked a scolding scoff towards that very aspect). Those production merits are doubtlessly admirable qualities assisting as acoustic echoes with polished screenplay by Peter Shaffer transitioning his 1981 play onto screen, leaving the artistic license in determining additional lengths that certainly add onto the fictional imaginary clash. In addition, you have immersive cinematography of the spacious void filled by replicative music as transportive link. The boundless expression here may be proven overwhelming to disjoint engagement by topical disinterest as ideally forewarned with lingering curiosity to identify elliptical lapses in narrative judgement. From that, the entire picture functions mainly as buildup towards the symbolically layered conclusion, brewing impactful power at captivating peak which furthers the haunting affection.

Albeit attributed towards the critical power, selective, typically soulful performances are memorable. F. Murray Abraham as Salieri steadily delves into the human condition’s dangerous embrace under envy, a sin he deviously personifies supposedly his defining height. His opposite in meaningful form Tom Hulce as Mozart has been the most affecting, not to mention under central haunting attribution, in embodying the morally ambitious spirit and heartened innocence that strikes resonance over the intolerant circumstances. While the main pair [specially] gained further recognition afterwards, Elizabeth Berridge as Mozart’s caring wife Conastanzee is noted comparably inactive, but her performance shows critical characterization with pure, clean consciousness.

Did I enjoy “Amadeus” the first time? Not really. Was it worth giving it another chance once enough timespan has passed? Yes, since I appreciate the overall craft more and found how tolerable objectivity varies. The contexts are bold and striking when properly grasped rather than initially faded into the powerful haze, and exceptionally designed through the overall art direction neatly reviving periodical history. Aside from those, the film more so invites than recommends, narrowing admirers as the sole demographic who actually acknowledge, evaluating its faithfulness, of the performed material, alongside admiration towards the specialized art serving respective monumental legacies. Per the critical lenses, and considering the acclaimed consensus, “Amadeus” is a jarring presentation ranged acceptably at decent enjoyment. (B)",3.5,5

Rotten Tomatoes, ,Good Will Hunting,"Alright, boys, grab a cold one and settle in, ‘cause we’re talking about Good Will Hunting, a movie that’s got more heart than a Game 7 overtime. This one’s a beauty—solid writing, unreal performances, and just enough rough-and-tumble to keep a beer league bruiser like me interested.
First off, Matt Damon absolutely snipes it as Will Hunting, a genius kid from South Boston who’d rather scrap in a parking lot than flex his brain in a university classroom. He’s got hands softer than a top-line playmaker but carries himself like a fourth-line grinder. The guy’s got the skills, but he’s stuck playing in the wrong league, you know?
Robin Williams as Sean, the therapist, is the real MVP here. The man dangles between wisdom and warmth like a vet keeping a young rookie in check. That “It’s not your fault” scene? Buddy, if you didn’t feel something, you might have a heart colder than a backyard rink in January. It’s the kind of speech that would even get a puck-chucker like me to open up.
The supporting cast? Top-notch. Ben Affleck’s got the chirps and the loyalty—every beer league team needs a guy like Chuckie. Minnie Driver’s Skylar is sweet, funny, and actually sees Will for the top-line talent he is. And let’s not forget Stellan Skarsgård’s professor, who’s basically that coach who sees potential but just can’t connect with the player.
The movie’s got grit, it’s got smarts, and it’s got a soundtrack that feels like a slow skate after a hard-fought win. If there’s one knock against it, it’s that it drags a little in the middle—kinda like the second period of a late-night men’s league game when the legs start burning from too many intermission beers.
Final verdict: Good Will Hunting is a classic. It’s about loyalty, second chances, and finding your true spot on the roster. 4.5/5—could’ve used a few more hockey references, but we’ll let it slide.

Rotten Tomatoes,Joseph D,Good Will Hunting,"Good Will Hunting is my favorite movie of all time, and I give it a perfect 5 out of 5 stars. The film’s powerful themes of self-discovery, love, and overcoming personal struggles make it stand out in a way that few movies can. Robin Williams’ performance as Dr. Sean Maguire is the highlight of the film. His emotional scene where he talks about love is something that stays with you long after watching. It’s raw and real, and it feels like he’s speaking directly to you. His honesty and warmth bring a depth to the movie that no one else could have done.
What I love most about this movie is the way it deals with deep emotions, like fear of opening up and being vulnerable. Robin Williams perfectly captures that understanding, showing that love isn’t just about romance, but about trust and connection. The way he helps Will (Matt Damon) break through his walls and realize his potential is so moving.
The film also has a perfect balance of humor and emotion, which makes it feel so real. Matt Damon and Ben Affleck both bring their characters to life in a way that makes you care about them, especially as they face their struggles.
Good Will Hunting is a powerful film that speaks to anyone who has ever doubted their worth or struggled with their own future. It’s a timeless classic, and every time I watch it, it feels like it gets better",5,5

Rotten Tomatoes,Rowan C,Good Will Hunting,"Good Will Hunting was a very good movie and this is something that all men should watch at least once in their lifetime. Will Hunting who is played by Matt Damon is a genius kid that makes stupid decisions in life. He gets arrested all of the time, lives in a horrible house and has his friends drive him around everywhere. This all changed when Professor Gerald Lambeau who is played by Stellan Skarsgard noticed that Will was the only one ever to solve the impossible theory in the hallway of a prestigous school. Will was arrested for assault and it was shown that he was able to get out on many other felonies because he was that smart. Gerald Lambeau decided to get Will out of jail by the terms of getting supervised by the professor and seeing a therapist at least once a week. All of the therapists quit on Will because all he did was insult them but one therapist came through and that was Sean Maguire who is played by Robin Williams. Sean basically teaches Will that all though he knows everything by book, he knows nothing about the real world and the experiences that come with it. During this process, Will meets a girl named Skylar who is played by Minnie Driver and their relationship started out as great. Will drove her away because he was scared about what the future would be like if he actually came to California with Skylar while living in Boston for his whole life. The sessions started off bad when Will was insulting Seans' dead wife but they quickly became close after Sean played Wills' game of not caring if Will didn't either. They went through very emotional sessions together and the Professor was setting up job interviews that Will kept failing on purpose. One of Wills' friends Chuckie Sullivan who is played by Ben Affleck tells him that the best part about his day is getting out of the car and walking up the steps just to only hope that Will will not answer because he has a gift. Chuckie tells Will that he would do anything for his gift and that Will should not waste another second of his life wasting it. This really stuck with Will and at the end of the movie, he ends up going for an interview. The last session concludes between the two and right before Will leaves with his new car that his friends got him, he leaves a note in Seans' mailbox. The letter said that Will had to go see about a girl, and Sean said ""Damnit, he stole my line"" which was great to see. Will told Skylar that he didn't love her earlier in the movie but at the end he realized that love is special. At the end of the movie, Will is seen driving to California to be with the woman that he loves. Overall, a very heartfelt movie with an even better cast and the character development we got to see from Will was just spectacular to witness.",4,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Lucas G,Good Will Hunting,I just watched this movie for the first time after being told by friends that I was missing out and I can tell you I wasn’t disappointed. This movie makes you emotional at times while still entertaining you in a positive way. This movie can cause you to reflect on yourself and think about what your doing with your life.,5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Ben S,Good Will Hunting,"I want nothing more than to give this movie a five-star rating. I can’t even begin to capture the beauty it portrays. Robin Williams and Matt Damon play their roles so perfectly it feels as if they can read each other’s minds, as though they’ve truly lived the lives of their characters. This movie will pull on every heartstring you possess. I cannot stress enough how much everyone needs to watch it—it will change you, and that change will undoubtedly be for the better.",4.5,5

Rotten Tomatoes,Shawan L,Good Will Hunting,"“Good Will Hunting” is a heartwarming tale that asks the important question: What happens when a janitor at MIT discovers he’s a math genius while simultaneously being the world’s best friend, all while avoiding adulting like it’s a game of dodgeball? The movie features some serious bro moments, with Ben Affleck as Will’s best friend who serves as both a motivational speaker and a reminder that you need a crew to keep your life somewhat sane. Enter Robin Williams as Sean, the therapist with more emotional baggage than Will’s entire childhood. As a whole, “Good Will Hunting” is a delightful rollercoaster of deep stuff and toilet humor. It’s the film that makes you want to have an epiphany while also making you laugh until you snort. So if you’re looking for a movie that reminds you that sometimes it’s okay to not have it all figured out (or to avoid algebra at all costs), this is the one for you.",5,5

Rotten Tomatoes,Joseph P,Good Will Hunting,"Well. Its been said a million times but I will say it again. They dont make them like this anymore. A movie that came out a year before i even walled this earth still has the power to seep right into your heart. Even though it follows the common story arc of young gifted orphan and old wise mentors, it has no problem making itself unique with its beautiful comedic moments and stellar cast. The dynamic between Robin Williams and Matt Damon is one of kind and possibly one of best on screen relationships in cinema. Add in huge names like Stellan Skaarsgard, Ben Afleck, and Minnie Driver, youve got a beautiful ensemble of comedy, intelligence, and passion.",5,5

Rotten Tomatoes,Amanda R,Oldboy,"To begin, the first word that comes to mind after watching the movie was sort of jaw-dropping and insane. This movie has a lot of twists and turns and sort of focuses on young people fighting each other. I would say you don't know what to expect at first given that there is beautiful classical music and throughout the movie you start to realize that there are incredibly gruesome and violent themes. The movie also has an incredible reveal which can be a little confusing if it's your first time watching. I personally didn't think the movie was terrible but definitely had some disturbing topics and is not a movie people should watch over and over. I do think the cinnamontography is quite good and the acting as well should note that it is quite dramatic. So overall this is something that you find interesting. I would give it a go on watching it.",2.5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,serenity s,Oldboy,"My thoughts on Oldboy are that it is, in my opinion, a great movie. The storyline of the film is very interesting, as well as the characters; it all ties well together. The acting in this film is amazing. Choi Min-sik’s acting is what brings out all the action in the film, making it interesting to watch. There are also so many emotions that you go through while watching this film, which is what I think makes this a very powerful way of adding to the story, almost as if you can feel what the characters are going through. It has amazing acting, and the cinematography of the film truly is what makes this film so captivating. It truly dives deeper than the original Japanese manga.",4,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Elizabeth M,Oldboy,"In my honest opinion, I enjoyed watching ""Old Boy"" and found it to be entertaining to watch unfold. I particularly enjoyed watching the fight sequences in this film. I also thought that it had pretty cool cinematography that included camera angles, lighting, and cuts. I enjoyed listening to the sound track in the movie. I think that what contributes to making a film good is a good sound track and this film did great in that. The ending of the film feels satisfying and unsatisfying at the same time once the truth is revealed. I would definitely recommend this film because I think it is a worth a watch so that people can enjoy it the way that I did.This film overall has an interesting plot, good fighting sequences, and a nice soundtrack. I would definitely watch this film again.",3.5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Ayden S,Oldboy,"This film and everything about it completely blew me away! Oldboy is one of those movies that grabs you from the first scene and just keeps dragging deeper into madness.. The story was interesting too, as it seemed simple at first glance, but truly unravels by the end of the film, revealing the story is anything but simple. The emotions are so raw, and the violence is so intense, but it never feels like I have to flinch from it, which I like. Choi Min-sik's performance was outstanding, allowing the movie to be amazing just from him just being on the screen. He makes you feel every ounce of pain, rage, and confusion. The movie is brutal but stylish, heartbreaking but somewhat beautiful. I loved it start to finish!",5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Brianna D,Oldboy,"I just watched Oldboy and it was wild from start to finish. The story follows a man named Oh Dae-su who gets kidnapped and held in a room for 15 years without knowing why. When he’s finally released, he has to figure out who did it and get revenge. The movie is dark, violent, and emotional, with a huge twist that completely shocked me. The acting and directing were really solid, and the hallway fight scene stood out as one of the best parts. I gave it 4 out of 5 stars because even though it was really well done, some parts were hard to watch and the plot was a little over the top at times. Still, it’s a powerful and unforgettable movie.",4,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Mate P,Oldboy,"Oldboy is a masterpiece of a movie even though it's not really my style.

The way the story unfolds, the way we get information is very unique and it took me lot of getting used to. It was hard to follow the story in the beginning, but that was also because of the fact that I don't really watch movies in a language I don't understand, so it was hard to keep up with the subtitles. The characters are very interesting and layered. I had a few minor issues with decisions they made, but in the end every one of those were explained. I thought I knew what was going to happen throughout the film, but in the end my jaw dropped. I thought this would be the ""original John Wick"", but it's far more than that.

The cinematography and editing are masterful. I didn't know about the iconic shot beforehand, so I didn't have expectations and yes, it has been done better since 2003, but I loved every second of it. The acting performances are great, but weird.

Oldboy is a crazy movie, I don't know if I want to see it again or not.",4.5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Saniy B,Oldboy,"This film directed by Park Chan-wook was definitely interesting. This movie includes many different twists, action, and emotion all in one. This film to me seemed very dark, and overall unpredictable. I think because it was unpredictable it made the plot exciting. This film is covering a man that was in prison for 15 years. To add to this there was no reason for him to be in prison. Thankfully out of nowhere he was released. After he was freed he was on a mission to figure out why he was even in prison in the first place. Well that was my question as well, so during this film we are going through all the questions he has as well. I can say production was good the way they were moving the camera and all. This movie dug deep into my mind leading me to have so many questions. This movie shows me how small things that happen in your life make a huge difference even if we don't notice. This is probably the best I have rated a movie so far this semester.",3.5,5

Pure edgelord trash, shock for shock's sake wrapped in fake depth.",0.5,5

I didn’t know what to watch so I put it on, I hadn’t heard anything about it and hadn’t seen many other Korean films. But it was one of those films you can’t stop thinking about weeks after watching it, I so thought I knew what the next turn of the plot would be, yet every time it baffled me. It’s a film so unbelievably creative and original that it is hard to think of another film that amazed me so much. (Also the music in the film is brilliant)",5,5

Rotten Tomatoes, ,Oldboy,"Woo jin with one if the best conclusions and backstory ever, also one of the best antagonists in fiction. And one of THE BEST plot twist 9.7/10",5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,John C,Oldboy,"I recently saw another Korean film ‘I Saw the Devil’ and, in light of the fact that I’ve now watched a film made by the same people, ‘Oldboy’ I’m glad I did.  Because I think that many of us have been kind of lulled into believing that the only way to make a film is ‘the Hollywood way.’ I didn’t like ‘I Saw the Devil’ when I started watching it, but, after persevering, I was glad I did in the end.  Plus, now I feel I know Korean cinema a little better (or how it’s done) I was able to enjoy (if that’s the right word) ‘Oldboy’ from the off.

And it’s certainly a difficult film to describe, let alone say who’s its target audience is.  A man – and not a particularly nice one – doesn’t bother seeing his estranged wife and baby daughter in favour of generally going out and getting drunk.  However, things quickly catch up with him when he’s swiped off the streets and locked in a room for no less than fifteen years without explanation.  However, during this time he’s had more than a few changes of heart.  Now he’s not only ready to find out and punish whoever imprisoned him in the first place, but also make amends with his daughter, who is now basically grown up in his absence.

It would be easy to label Oldboy as a ‘revenge thriller.’ Yes, there are certainly aspects of hunting down those who wronged him.  But it’s the way it’s done that makes it so different.  I would go into specifics, but it’s one of those films where if you say too much about the plot you will give away vital points which will lead to you predicting what’s to come.  It’s fair to say that there are more than a few twists and turns to keep you interested (or disgusted?) and you will not only need to be ready for those, but also have a strong stomach in terms of content material.

Which brings me back to my thoughts on who it’s marketed at.  I don’t really know – people who like revenge movies, but can tolerate some pretty disturbing storylines mainly.  Oh, and subtitles.  It’s got subtitles – but then you probably guessed that.  However, even though you have to read the dialogue it’s still easy to tell that the cast are pretty impressive and there are performances that are going to stick with you – even if some of them are for the wrong reasons.

Basically, if you like your foreign revenge films dark then give this one a go.  Just don’t blame me for any therapy you may require after sitting through it.  A classic, but a dark one.",4,5

Some surprising guest are very welcome.",3,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Cole G,Doctor Strange In The Multiverse Of Madness,"Sam Rami’s shot at a Doctor Strange movie is good, but with less reshoots and more power to Raimi, I think this could’ve been great. The horror aspects of this movie are some of the best parts and you really feel Raimi’s flare added to it, however certain parts feel like marvel restraining him to follow the MCU formula. The Illuminati is an intriguing but underutilized group of hero’s who only survive for 5 minutes. The one who killed them, Wanda, is a great villain who sometimes takes the spotlight as the film can feel like a Scarlet Witch movie at some points (whether that’s good or bad, im not sure). Stephen Strange grows as a character and has some cool moments using his magic, but also is a great mentor to America Chavez, who feels more like a plot device than an actual character. Overall, it is a solid movie that hopefully a third movie can build off of. 7.4/10",3.5,5

And the garage scene has got to be one of the most underrated suspense sequences I’ve ever seen.

It never became daring or provocative enough for the subject matter and doesn't live up to the full potential of its concept. This film lacks heavily in any amount of heart or sincerity, and it comes off less as a valid criticism of suburbia, and more of a mockery of it by someone who doesn't know anything about it. This film could've easily been saved by focusing more on the characters and their possible complexities than being a pretentious film that ultimately never knows what it's talking about.",2,5

I thought everything was great, the acting, the comedy, the stylish choreography.  I thought it was a revolutionary film and worthy of all the awards. Watching it twenty years later and my opinion might not be as strong. I still believe Mena Suvari was absolutely amazing,  really stealing the film. The camera work and choreography,  still incredible and captivating.  However,  I do find the story not nearly as clever as I thought it was back then. Still bold, as this subject matter could not be presented today, no way. I also find Benning's performance over the top, Spacey's as well. It's still an impactful film and worthy of examination,  just maybe not quite as godly as I originally thought.",4,5

Lizzie is an amazing person that did not back down from the bullying she received as a result of her very rare disease, she was dubbed ""The World's Ugliest Woman"" in a Youtube video that went viral, but instead used it as a platform to make a difference in the world and highlight and inform on the negative impact of bullying.

I hope that my girls (and every child out there) never has to go through bullying - especially as bad as Lizzie endured - but knowing that if they do, they can listen to her message and remember that it doesn't matter what they say if you believe in yourself is beyond comforting - it is hope. I am as certain as she is that God put this sweet soul on the earth for a reason, as exactly perfect as she is, and she is doing an amazing job with her life! If you have children or teens this is a must to share with them, as is her TED talk. She is the anti Kardashian and a truly beautiful person.",4.5,5

The Ultimate (film) version of the Life of William Wallace has this & more in spades.

""Sniggering Hom*phobia""  ""Squeezes The Life Out Of The Role"" and other jealous, callous, unwarranted &/or petty colloquial negative critiques about this epic film are thrown out by Film Critics who can't work & thrive in the actual industry which they make their living praising (or dumping on).

It's basically an epic film with war, love, and involves forces beyond our understanding. The english voice acting is really good all around. Everything else is masterful. The animation is gorgous, the soundtrack is sweeping, beautiful, peaceful and memorable. It masterfully weaves the forest/curse of our main hero with the war between the two factions effortlessly. On top of that there is just alway something visually amazing to look at and is super distinct, haunting, beautiful, and always something we've never seen before. The biggest thing to is this 100% has an enviormentalist message to it. But it never feels on the nose or putting the message first before good storytelling and great characters to tell it through.

Rotten Tomatoes,2 K,Princess Mononoke,"Review from Japan. I love this movie. And I especially like the scene where the leper talks to Ashitaka, but I think the English subtitles are incorrect.
The following is a machine-translated text of the scene from Japanese.
-----
Young man, I understand your anger and sorrow, for I too have been cursed. I understand, but please do not kill the lady. 
She is the only one who treated us as human beings. Do not fear our sickness, wash and bandage my rotten flesh...
""Life is truly painful and hard. I curse the world, I curse others, and yet I want to live.""
Forgive her for my foolishness.
----

However, the English subtitles translate the double-quote as follows
----
Life is suffering. It is hard. The world is cursed. But still, you find reasons to keep living.
----

The meaning of “I want to live even if it hard so much that I curse the world.” and “You must live even if the world is cursed” are completely different.
Of course, there must be some kind of intention of the translator, but I think this translation is inappropriate.",5,5

Rotten Tomatoes,Brad M,Your Name 2017,"Makoto Shinkai’s Your Name (Kimi no Na wa) is nothing short of breathtaking. This beautifully animated film masterfully blends romance, fantasy, and drama, crafting an emotional journey that lingers long after the credits roll.

What begins as a lighthearted body-swap comedy soon unfolds into a deeply emotional and suspenseful tale of love, fate, and time itself. The film’s pacing is impeccable, keeping you invested while unraveling its intricate narrative in a way that feels both magical and heartbreakingly real.

Visually, Your Name is a feast for the eyes. Every frame is beautifully crafted, from the stunning landscapes of the countryside to the vibrant energy of Tokyo. Shinkai’s signature use of light, color, and movement creates an atmosphere that feels almost ethereal.

Complementing the visuals is the phenomenal soundtrack by RADWIMPS, which enhances every emotional beat of the film. Tracks like ""Zenzenzense"" and ""Sparkle"" perfectly capture the excitement, longing, and wonder that define Your Name.

At its core, Your Name is a story about connection. How love can transcend time, distance, and even memory. It delivers an emotional gut punch that will leave you teary-eyed yet hopeful. Whether you're a fan of anime or not, this film is a must-watch and easily one of the greatest animated films ever made.",5,5

Rotten Tomatoes,Jay W,Your Name 2017,"Not just another body swap movie:

The BEST body swap movie ever.

People had been recommending me to see ""Your Name."" for years. I was hesitant. I've seen so many body swap movies, and even more body swap cartoon episodes. I thought the trope had been done to death. I've seen it all before, and I don't need to see it anymore. I figured the animation looks great but surely the story will be tired and cliched. Especially when it is a boy switching with a girl, I'm sure there will be several easy role reversal jokes and lessons learned about walking a mile in someone else's shoes.

But I finally got around to actually watching the film, and thankfully I was 100% wrong. This movie was not just beautifully animated, but also told a beautiful story. The story does not waste any time in getting started, and jumps right into the body swap element of the story. Like many things in the film, they incorporate it in a very clever way. No explanation is explicitly given, whether it has do with solar flares, an ancient ritual, some cosmic link or just opening a fortune cookie at the same time the fact is these two characters have swapped bodies.

They forego all the tired tropes of this convention along the way. When they swap bodies, they don't trade voice actors, that always bothered me with other ""Freaky Friday"" body swaps, why would their voice change? But you can still tell whose in which body by their actions and attitude. There is no attempt by the one to destroy the life of the other for petty reasons. And there isn't much of a ""I guess it isn't easy being you..."" lesson involved in it.

The characters are a ton of fun, you quickly get invested in the drama of their lives and root for them to succeed. The story takes a number of twists and turns that I did not see coming. There were actually a couple of moments that made me audibly gasp while I was watching it. I was really that invested in the story.

This movie has helped me see the benefits of revisiting old story telling tropes. Because most of us are already familiar with the body swap story, the creator is able to take that and put a new twist on the story. I thank all those who wouldn't shut up about this movie, and thank them for not spoiling the different story beats. Nor will I spoil them here. Suffice it to say: It's a new twist on an old classic, the name of the best body swap movie is ""Your Name.""",4.5,5

Rotten Tomatoes,Insomniac X,High And Low,"A chilling and masterful hybrid of social drama and procedural thriller. Kurosawa begins with a rarefied moral dilemma fit for Greek tragedy before taking his audience on a harrowing descent into the heart of poverty, violence and addiction that makes the torturous decisions of the first act seem trivial by comparison. Deftly balances an array of disparate tones before concluding with one of the most haunting final scenes in cinema. One of Kurosawa's finest.",5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Leprechaun K,High And Low,A masterpiece by Kurosawa.  Some 60+ years later and it still holds as a great crime-suspense thriller.,4,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Sam N,High And Low,"It feels almost blasphemous to criticise anything Kurosawa touches, but High and Low didn't grip me as much as other works I've seen. That's not to say it isn't a fascinating film—its dual narratives make for an intriguing watch. The first is a morality play, dissecting how wealth and the threat to it can bend a person's ethics. At times, though, it feels like the film is too apologetic towards the wealthy, suggesting their moral compromises are innocent necessities. At the same time, the poor are portrayed mainly as a criminal underclass who cannot be reformed. The second narrative, a detailed police procedural with clear film-noir influences, is arguably the most impactful, having left its mark on countless films since and earning our appreciation and respect for its impact on the cinematic world. 

Despite its strengths, by the final act, I found myself enduring the runtime rather than thoroughly enjoying it. It's an undeniably solid film, but not quite Kurosawa at his most transcendent.",4,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Jay W,High And Low,"I like Kurosawa, he makes great films, even if they don't have samurai. ""High and Low"" is another great film from a legendary director. Everything is framed and staged to perfection. The dialogue is tightly written, and the setup is a clever premise. Kidnappers call ""National Shoes"" company manager ransoming his son. They then find out that the criminals abducted the wrong kid. The man, Kingo Gondo, then has the moral dilemma of what to do.

The main problem in this film happens in the final 20 minutes. I won't go into spoilers but suffice it to say that after 2 hours of tight suspenseful writing, the movie takes an overly long detour. The ending itself is great, it is just the 20-minute extra step that kills its momentum.

But overall, its highs definitely outweigh its lows.",3.5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Milo F,High And Low,"While innovative, Heaven & Hell/High & Low is also laboured & wildly uneven. It progresses through three or four genres, and not all of them work.

Some of the 'policier' or crime procedural devices have made appearances in other Asian films, eg Dust for Dust.

It is difficult to avoid bursting out in laughter at the corny ending, for which culty AK fans will not forgive you. 

Suggest sitting close to an exit.",2,5
Rotten Tomatoes,ben j,High And Low,"Didn't expect this to instantly become one of my favorite movies of all time. It's almost overwhelmingly suspenseful and thrilling. I love both ""halves"" of the movie—the first 50 minutes of debating about what to do and answering calls from the aubductor, and the rest of the movie being the greatest police procedural I've ever seen as they track down the criminal. An otherwise basic story becomes infused with meaning about themes like duty, honor, existentialism, and most importantly the split between the ""high"" and ""low"" in society, whether that be class, status, moral nature, or how high one's house is, overlooking all the other ones ""like it's laughing at them."" Kurosawa is a master of his craft, everyone should see this.",5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,S R,High And Low,"Interesting take on police work by Kurosawa.  It transitioned from drama to police in a way that I didn't expect.  Regardless, it entertained and showed a different aspect of Kurosawa that reminded me of Hitchcock at times.  It was on HBO.",3.5,5

Rotten Tomatoes,Yash B,High And Low,"Among the films directed by Akira Kurosawa, ""High and Low"" is among the most entertaining. This is a very good crime thriller with an outstanding first half. I found myself so engaged with the beginning part of this movie that I felt like the second half just couldn't live up to it for me. I still think the whole story is good but something does happen that causes the focus of the movie to shift as it progresses. I think the movie tackles a lot of interesting topics outside of just being entertaining and think it is clear it influenced many other films that came after it. Overall, this is another film that showcases Kurosawa's versatility as a filmmaker and it just continues to make me wonder if there was anything he couldn't do.",4,5
Rotten Tomatoes,WS2005 S,High And Low,"A great film and I can see some similarities with David Mamet's style who I  would suspect was influenced by the great director, Kurosawa.

Rotten Tomatoes,TheFilmReviewer 1,High And Low,"High and Low benefits from Akira Kurosawa's brilliant direction, but is ultimately held together by Toshiro Mifune's legendary performance, confidently establishing itself as one of the greatest police procedural dramas of all time, if not Kurosawa and Mifune's best collaboration.",5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,eduardosuarez,High And Low,"Decent, but pretty thin on plot. It goes from what you think is going to be a good noir setup to a pretty dull police procedural. No real twists, no rising stakes. It's also a good half an hour too long. I wouldn't watch it again.",3,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Christopher B,High And Low,"Suspenseful and well acted, Kurosawa takes on the Film-Noir genre and crafts a beautiful filmed masterpiece! At a running time of nearly two and a half hours, the film absorbs you in to the story and setting, from the mansion that Gondo (Toshirô Mifune) owns where the first hour takes place to the drug infested streets, and never lets go! While you admire Gondo for making such a huge sacrifice to save the child's life, you feel sick to think of how his life dive bombs because of it. What a totally engaging film that is so beautifully captured in all of it's details that it makes a long film seem short and makes you hope that it never ends! Highly Recommended, especially for Kurosawa fans and fans of the film-noir genre!",5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,William L,High And Low,"High and Low is a very good movie, a taut investigative thriller that keeps the tension up throughout the entire runtime. So when I say it might not even crack the top five best films from Kurosawa, it's not a knock on this particular movie but a remark on how good the director's filmography is. 

There's a lot to like about High and Low, first and foremost hinging much of the plot on a moral decision; you get to know these characters just enough to get a sense of their lifestyle, before the script dangles it all on a razor's edge, all the hopes and ambitions of one man's entire life suddenly are rendered insecure as his base morality is called into question. And subsequently, you get to see the relative fallout from his paradoxical choice; despite making the right call, the demands of conservative Japanese society end up resulting in real penalties for him regardless. But while the film could have been a tighter, perhaps more pointed classic if it were to focus only on Mifune's tortured Gondo, the script evolves into a pure investigative film, revealing the identity of the culprit but allowing the audience to take part in the series of incremental clues that gradually tighten the net around him in a pseudo-Hitchcockian manner. While that sort of dynamic could have easily slipped into 'a tale of two films', the direction keeps the plot grounded and appropriately interwoven, capped by some great ground-level shots of semiurban postwar Japan. 

While not as overtly philosophical as many of the period pieces that Kurosawa is most often associated with, High and Low still showcases much of the attention to detail that he is known for and gives a bit of depth to his more traditional subject matter, allowing him to work with pure thriller elements in addition to moral qualms. (4.5/5)",4.5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,samuel s,High And Low,"An experience. Incredible film that holds up very well. Some of the moving shots in the train even look like they've been shot recently. Really compelling watch. I feel like Matt Reeves might've took some inspiration from this for ""The Batman"", especially with the ending scene and dialogue.",5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,andres s,High And Low,"Right off the bat I love the whole noir feel to the film with the smokey city in the background and the cool jazz music during the opening credits. I love how attentive and alert the camera work is. It makes everything seem much more thrilling and interesting than it really is. It's intriguing to watch how these plots between powerful people are concocted. They're literally just lounging around in Gondo's apartment plotting to overtake the company president. Gondo, the head of factory, seems to be getting a good deal, but you never know if the other three can turn around and blame him if anything goes south. I admire Gondo's virtuous values of honor, honesty and integrity towards the shoes his factory make. He's not willing to downgrade quality just so all the execs can put more money in their pockets, I respect that. Unbelievable how greedy and selfish those three execs are, saying that they will take Gondo out if he doesn't play ball. Wow, the is an incredibly captivating way to start the movie - full of intensity, tension and drama. It puts us right in the middle. The setup is impeccable. 

I love how Gondo's kids are playing outlaw vs. sheriff - perhaps foreshadowing how the events between Gondo and the execs are going to play out. Ok wow, my opinion of Gondo has kind of changed. He's risked everything, bet everything - something very dangerous and reckless - on this one business deal with someone who we don't even know yet. So cool seeing Nakadai as Chief Inspector Tokura. I feel like Kawanashi, Gondo's right hand man, might be somewhat involved or is going to be involved when he leaves to go to the airport, in the kidnapping that's taken place. I can't imagine how hard this whole situation for Gondo is. On one hand, he's got the money to pay for the kidnapper's ransom, but on the other hand it's the same money that he's going to use for the business opportunity. It's a very interesting situation because the child they kidnapped wasn't Gondo's, it was his helpers son, Aoki. So now this moral dilemma comes into play of will he or won't he save Aoki's son. I wonder what actions Gondo will take. Is he willing to sacrifice everything on saving someone else's child? 

Holy shit! Things get intense on the train. Duuuude, with all the passengers on the train and the hand held camera, it feels legit. Sooo good! Dude I can't believe he threw out 30 million yen out of the window without even knowing if they're going to keep their word! Ok this movie is fucking brilliant. The first half of the movie was all inside the apartment. Now we're traveling around, exploring adventuring. This is truly a pleasant surprise. I thought the whole movie was going to take place in the apartment. That shot of everyone watching the filmed footage that was taken on the train has great meme potential. What a great shot. I don't know how I knew, but I knew that they were going to show the pink smoke with actual color. That's crazy! That club scene with all the Americans and the funny black guy was so unexpected. Lol. That was pretty ballsy how they did the drug handoff right in the middle of the dance floor as they were dancing. That whole club scene really changed the mood of the entire movie at that point - sort of livening it up and adding some fun into it. Wow, that Dope Alley scene was pretty terrifying and quite sad. Seeing all those strung out addicts just looming around like zombies. Kind of scary. I'm glad justice was served in the end. What a powerful ending. That final performance from the guy who plays Takeuchi was so good. And the way he gets dragged off and the gate closes right on Gondo's face and all we see is his reflection was finale perfection. I liked how we get a glimpse into Takeuchi's backstory. It sort of solidifies why he did what he did. But at the same time it doesn't excuse him of the crimes he committed. The man was sociopathic and what he did was malicious and evil. 

This is perhaps one of Kurosawa's most modern-looking movies he's ever made - and it looks outstanding! You can tell by the cinematography and how the story unfolds, that this is a brilliant movie. The whole journey Gondo goes through is a trial of morals, ethics and doing what's right. This movie proves that you don't have to film in dozens of different locations to make an exceptional film. If the writing is solid and the acting is true, that's all that matters. This is very similar to 12 Angry Men and One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest where both take place within the same location for the majority of the movie, and both are masterpieces of cinema. The way Kurosawa used actors to kind of frame or block shots was so good. The lighting is subtle and underrated, you would never notice how exquisite it was if you weren't looking for it. Like the way Gondo is sitting in the background and all you can see is his silhouette. One of the most exemplary things about this movie is that you feel like you're there, in the middle of everything, taking part in everything that's going on. Every decision, every thought. This movie proves that not every rich person is a selfish greedy monster. The first half is all about getting Aoki's son back while the second half is the procedural detective work trying to nab the kidnapper and return the money. A brilliant detective thriller movie. It was a great ride, I wouldn't mind taking it again.",4.5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,mike l,High And Low,"This masterpiece incorporates suspense, drama, and actually a bit of comedy as well as any movie today.",5,5
Rotten Tomatoes, ,High And Low,"A below par and laboured thriller. The trouble is that there's no real Whodunnit element, no twists or turns, no thrilling suspense. It's just a crime, followed by an investigation, followed by capturing a guy with the most tenuous of motives, all played out across almost two and a half hours. Really drags in places and the final melodramatic scene doesn't resolve anything or leave any lasting emotion. I can't see what all the fuss is about.",1.5,5
Rotten Tomatoes, ,High And Low,"Lengthy but never boring. The great Akira Kurosawa's High and Low keeps you engaged from the beginning to the haunting end with strong characters, a sense of urgency throughout, and themes not often found in mystery crime thrillers.",4,5
Rotten Tomatoes, ,High And Low,"1963's High and Low reveals the great Akira Kurosawa at the peak of both his thriller and class comentary game, taking a relatively unknown mystery novel, The King's Ransom, adapting it loosely and turning its story into an essentially flawless film defined by an air-tight police procedural structure, moral ambiguity and compelling characters portrayed by an ensemble with a colossal Toshiro Mifune at the helm.

Combine that with impressive, innovative camera-work and direction worth being studied in film school and you'll get one of the best crime thrillers ever made and the inspiration for so many that came after, if not one of Kurosawa's most popular films, unfortunately, but this only speaks to the scope of his legacy.",5,5

Rotten Tomatoes,Ahnaf Tech,3 Idiots,"On the canvas of student life, the movie 3 Idiots paints an inspiring picture that invokes a spectrum of feelings in the viewers' minds starting from humor to happiness and sorrow. It strikes a perfect balance of smart wits and realism in the dialogues. Although most of the movie plays on the themes of hilarious satire, it tugs at the heartstrings when it does not shy away from incorporating the grim fates some hapless students are inevitably faced with. 

Anyone who has had any form of formal education can easily relate to the plot and stay mesmerized throughout the screening of the film, drawing correlations involving teacher-student, parent-student and student-student relationships as well as getting fascinated by the distinct dynamics such relationships contain within them.

All-in-all, a must-watch masterpiece intended for viewing of all age-ranges. Behold, the canvas of student life in the form of a feature-film, its colors shaded by the vicissitudes of it.",5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Diandra Nada Z,3 Idiots,"I think that the show was good, with comedy, thriller, and slice of life as its main genres. It touches upon some sensitive topics like the pressure from the education system existing in India's universities and showcases how that pressure can result in many negative outcomes.
But despite that, the story overall is very inspirational, and not all sad. The main character, an engineering student, Rancho, is a guy that breaks the expectations of a lot of people by how out-of-the-box his thinking is. His two friends, also engineering students, Farhan and Raju become friends with him due to his fun nature.

The story's timeline is a mix of flashbacks and the present. Where Farhan and Raju drive around the country in an attempt to find their old friend whose whereabouts were almost unknown, while they reminisce about their good old memories from back in their college days. I won't say anymore because spoilers of anything else would make it less enjoyable to watch.

There are some sensitive topics and scenes in the film like suicide, and depression, so it might not be suitable for everyone, including young children (the age rating is PG-13). But that aside, it's quite enjoyable, and is a movie that has the ability to resonate with the audience deeply due to its plot and genre, especially if they are going through a time similar to that with the characters in the movie (during college). I would recommend watching it if you haven't already.

Now we also need to talk about the cinematography in this film. The beautiful landscapes of India were recorded and shown in a way that is easy on the eyes, and really add a touch of emotion and serenity into the storytelling.

I believe that the moral of the story is that, at the end of the day, education is without a doubt very important, but we can learn new things anytime, from new, different and unexpected places or maybe people, and not just from school or university, and that knowledge cannot be limited to just maths, science, etc, but other things like photography too. The message is heartwarming, touching and very motivational. Profound life lessons showcased with humour, in an unforgettable journey. It's a good watch.",4,5

Rotten Tomatoes,Jo W,Front Of The Class,"A very well done representation of a certain kind of tourette syndrome.   What makes it well done is that it addresses the hardship and real life challenges of being different.  The main character's endless chirping and barking also gives the watcher an experience of that 'annoyance' first hand in way.  It allows the supportive characters in the story to also be annoyed as well.  They also touch on another difficult subject, which is cancer, and while it's a brief visit through the movie, I really like how they normalize the experience.   To those that have not experienced that personally, it might seem weird, but I thought they did a magnificent job of addressing illness.  Of course, in reality, if someone loses someone to illness, often that segment of friends is not so supportive, but who wants to watch people be awful.   
This movie touches enough of the unfortunate responses to disease, while also sending an inspiring message of perseverance and hope.",5,5

Rotten Tomatoes,Jonathan K,Once Upon A Time In America,"It’s a long, slow, methodical journey through a life of crime, and while there’s definitely a lot that could’ve been trimmed, part of the charm is just settling in and letting the full weight of time wash over you. It feels like the level of appreciation is in proportion with how much you're willing to just watch moments stretch out the way they might in real life.

Excellent cinematography and the score by Ennio Morricone should have won the Oscar (it wasn't even nominated!). A lot of snubs for this film.

The acting feels pretty dated but, per usual, De Niro holds it down. The pacing plods at times, but it’s artful. And the film as a whole clicks a lot more once you’ve seen it all the way through, especially with the drug/dream layer in mind.",3,5

It dives into themes such as, friendship, poverty, betrayal, and how time changes people.  It truly is a beautifully written movie. It tells a deep and complex story about the American dream. It does a great job visually showing how the American dream isn’t always what it seems. The cinematography, music score and style of which the film was made of adds to the overall greatness of this film. The way the characters are written and portrayed makes it feel real and relatable. The characters aren’t just one dimensional but very complex in their own way. It is truly is a timeless film with other themes outside of the typical crime movies like loss and memory. The only problem I have with this movie is that it’s 4 hours long and can get boring at times; but I do believe it was 4 hours for a reason.",3.5,5

The character development is particularly impressive, with each role adding depth and nuance to the story.

Visually, it's stunning; the cinematography captures the essence of the settings beautifully, enhancing the overall atmosphere.

Rotten Tomatoes,Jay W,Once Upon A Time In America,"""Once Upon a Time in America"" is a tricky movie to review. The film had various production issues, mainly surrounding the runtime of the movie. The version now released is 3 hours 49 minutes. The theatrical release was cut down to a 2-hour version. Leone's original plan had the footage at 6 hours, planning on it to be 2 movies. It says something about the film, that I would be interested in seeing those alternate versions. But I will try not to speculate about what could have been, but instead focus on what we got here, the 229-minute version. And what we have here... is a mixed bag.

Starting with the positives, the music by Ennio Morricone is, shock, really really good. The soundtrack is able to capture a specific melancholy reminiscing feeling that only Morricone and Beatles songs can do.

Also, when the movie focuses on the 4 gangsters using their street smarts to outdo the law and rivals it leads to some very creative and clever scenes. The solutions rely less on money and manpower, but more on simple ingenuity.

It might be obvious, given the reputation of those involved, but it’s worth mentioning. The actors all do a great job. De Niro feels like he was born to play a gangster. James Woods has a lot of emotional explosions that he has to sell, and he delivers on these big reactions.

Now it is time for the negative side. I will concede, some of these are personal gripes, but this is my review, so these are my problems. This movie has a lot of scenes that are just hard to watch. The world is unpleasant. And I get it, the director is not glamorizing the gangster life. The feeling of regret permeates the story. That doesn't mean I want to see a sexual assault. I won't go into all the grizzly details; you can check the parental guide if you want to know.

About the first 100 minutes focuses on De Niro and the gang as 12 year old kids. This whole section of the movie is dull. And at some points I feel like I should be on some sort of watchlist for looking at this stuff. The section of the movie that’s ""GoodFella Babies"" is not what I'm looking for.

Likewise, the section of the movie that has old man De Niro, is overly long. Once again, I get why they needed to frame the story in this way. But every time they cut to him reminiscing, any momentum is killed, and it just an old man wandering around.

Overall, there is a lot of good parts in the film. You just have to sit through a lot of middling stuff and some filth in order to get to it. Some may disagree, but that's what is great about America, you are free to have your own opinion.",3,5

Rotten Tomatoes,Patrick W,Once Upon A Time In America,"Let me start off by saying that this film is a sleeper for many people. It is also an undeniable masterpiece. I found this movie to be superior to Goodfellas, Godfather and Godfather II in almost every way. Yes, I went there. Deal with it. 

This is a powerful work of cinematic art, which is, I suppose, to be expected given the fact that it was also the final film released before the untimely death of Director Sergio Leone. If you watch this film, it needs to be the Martin Scorsese restored Director's Cut of the film - but be warned, that film is over FOUR HOURS long, but it is the ONLY enjoyable way to watch it. The American butchered edit is a jumbled mess and the reason this film was panned in America in 1984.

This film was a who's who of actors in the 1980's. Robert DeNiro, James Woods, Joe Pesci, Treat Williams, Elizabeth McGovern, the list goes on and on. If you miss out on this film, that is a terrible shame, because it is totally worth a viewing, but don't be surprised if you end up watching it multiple times. It is THAT good!",5,5

At first, I didn't want to review the movie, just give it the highest rating and leave it at that because I don't think I am worthy to judge it. And here I am, writing this, not because I have become any worthier but because people need to watch it. Capernaum tugs at your heartstrings and makes you ache. It's painful, and not in an ordinary way. I watched the movie a few days back and I still think about it. It's definitely made me more grateful for the things I have. The actors don't feel like they're acting (to some extent they're not), it feels like a reality, their innocent eyes describing a journey most of the world was unaware of.

I want to recommend this to everyone, but if you're at a low point in your life or show signs of depression, avoid it, you suffer enough. I watched most of the film with tears streaming down my face and at the end, I just sat in the dark with the credits rolling and wondering about the world we live in.

Rotten Tomatoes,Azis M,Capernaum,"Unflinching yet undeniably powerful film, Capernaum is a gut-wrenching portrayal of a childhood stolen, a stark indictment of societal inequalities. The film doesn't shy away from the harsh realities of Zain's world. We witness child exploitation, crushing poverty, and the callous indifference of a system that has failed him.

Labaki's masterstroke lies in casting non-professional actors like Zain Al Rafeea, whose raw, unfiltered performances pierce through the screen with an almost documentary-like immediacy. He's not playing a role; he is Zain.

Rotten Tomatoes,William L,Capernaum,"Misery porn doesn't automatically make for good drama, and Capernaum is proof positive of that sentiment; the film often features excellent cinematography and an exceptionally good performance from child actor Zain Al Rafeea (as protagonist Zain), but is a mix of sincere, simple conflicts and laughably heavy-handed and unrealistic melodrama. Perhaps the best representation of this is a framing device where Zain literally takes his parents to court in an attempt to prevent them from having kids, where all the attendees are dumbfounded by the supposedly profound nature of his statements as if Frank Capra was brought on to tack on an ending to this screenplay. The events of the film are tragic, yes, but there isn't much in the way of context or theme to them, everything is just to provide another layer of struggle for our poor protagonist to contend with. Except juvenile prison, weirdly enough. It's sort of glossed over (like a lot in this film that probably should have been explored more), but once there Zain sort of gets taken in by an Artful Dodger-esque crowd without any sort of fanfare. It's Al Rafeea that really saves a lot of this film, delivering actual sincerity where Capernaum could have easily slid into being a very nicely framed arthouse melodrama alone. (2.5/5)",2.5,5

Rotten Tomatoes, ,Capernaum,"For the most part, I generally want to kind of, for all intents and purposes, discuss how I would particularly generally apply IR theories to the movie in a basic kind of fairly major way, which mostly is quite significant in a particular major way.

Rotten Tomatoes, ,Capernaum,"The message of the movie is beautifully delivered through a documentary-like realism manner, using real world issues through which it is able to engage the audience as well as spread awareness about the conditions in major parts of the world. The story is wonderfully narrated through great direction and acting. The movie is able to engage the audience in such a manner that enables us to feel the emotions of the actors even if we aren't physically present there, and helps us reflect on our awareness and actions towards such issues. It presents the reality of the world in its truest form but also concludes it with optimism for the future. Overall, the movie was
a great learning experience and is a must watch",5,5
Rotten Tomatoes, ,Capernaum,"For this assignment I chose to write the film review on the movie we watched in class, Capernaum. This movie talks about the story of a Lebanese young boy who escapes from his careless parents. As the movie develops, it narrates how Zain, the young Lebanese boy, is able to survive on his own. He meets an Ethiopian refugee family, and as the mother gets caught, he took the role of a parent for the baby refugee, Yonas. Throughout the movie, viewers can see the horrible conditions these people live in and how mistreated and abused poor children are. This movie depicts many violations of human rights as it unfolds the conditions families in poverty live in. 

	Since the beginning of the film, viewers can start to notice the inhumane conditions characters in this movie live in. One of the many sisters Zayn has, Sahar, gets her period at the beginning of the movie. When Zayn realizes what will happen to Sahar when their parents notice that she got her period, he does everything in his power to help her hide it as much time as she can. He was trying to help his sister cover this since he knew once their parents notice it, she would be sent off to marry the shop owner that sent her free food once in a while. After his sister is sent off to marry the shop owner, Zayn vanishes to the streets, and this is when he finds the caring Ethiopian woman. He now starts taking care of the baby as his mother goes out to work. When the baby's mother gets sent off to prison, Zayn takes responsibility of taking care of baby Yonas. When Zayn realizes he can no longer take good care of baby Yonas, he gives him away to a human trafficker in exchange of him going off to another country and starting a new life. But for this, he needs his papers or some sort of identification. He decides to go back to his neglect household in order to get the documentation he needs to go off to another country. When he gets to his house, he realizes that his sister Sahar, is no longer alive. He gets carried away by his anger and stabs the shop owner, which gets him sent off to jail. In jail, he reunites with Yonas' mother, which makes her realize that Yonas got handed to the human trafficker. 

	This film portrays the reality of refugee children, poverty, and violated rights. It creates consciousness about the current refugee problem in Lebanon. There are around half a million refugee children in Lebanon. Currently, there are many organizations looking to solve this problem. They have successfully managed to open schools in order to offer free education for school-aged Syrian refugee children in Lebanon. They are now working on regain these projects since the coronavirus pandemic slowed the pace of their plans. The pandemic has interrupted the refugee children education in Lebanon and has affected the school openings. Humanitarian groups continue to work to provide better life conditions to these children. Even though some have managed to provide them with free education, many of them are still not able to attend classes because their families can not afford transportation. 

	In conclusion, the movie Capernaum depicts the effects violation of human rights have on refugee children that live in extreme poverty. Portraying these kids lives' challenges makes viewers realize the seriousness of the refugee problem in the world fast it is growing. Even though there are currently many donor organizations that work hard to minimize the refugee current problem, there is still a lot of work that can be done. In my opinion, producing a movie of the inhumane ways many people around the world live in, and how horrifying the effects are on their lives, is a great way to create awareness about the world's refugee crisis",4.5,5
Rotten Tomatoes, ,Capernaum,"The film is a heart-wrenching masterpiece that demonstrates what life is like for people who live in poverty, and especially in poor countries such as Lebanon. It is not sugar coated, and the way the director and producer filmed Capernaum is so genius that it allows the viewers to form an emotional attachment towards Zain. Allowing them to be able to experience his pain themselves, even if they are not physically there to experience it. I feel like this film provides a very good educational experience to the viewers in the best way possible.",5,5
Rotten Tomatoes, ,Capernaum,"I'm glad that our professor picked out this movie to show in our International Relation class. This videos inclues Human Rights, foreign policy, global trade, migration and refugees, human rights, human trafficking, sustainable development, gender. It's sad to see how kids are suffering at a young age by their cruel parents. Every kid should be at school learning. This movie is truly sad and made me realize how grateful I am and I shall never complain about anything.",4.5,5
Rotten Tomatoes, ,Capernaum,"This movie really opened my eyes. While showing very treacherous living and working conditions while following the life of a 12-year-old Zain, it also shows the very real situation happening in Lebanon. When Zain appears in court many times, we see that he is in fact the plaintiff and is wanting to sue his parents. When asked why, he responds ""Because I was born."" While living with his neglecting parents and many siblings, at times Zain has to choose between being a kid and working long shifts on the streets to support his large family. The actress and director Nadine Labaki says ""How did we get to the point where we deprived a child of the most basic right, to close his eyes and sleep. This movie depicts child and human trafficking, the struggle and fear the undocumented population goes through every day, and the unknown struggle young children are put through in these slums. Zain even takes over the role of a caretaker when Rahil goes missing and he takes care of her daughter until he no longer can. 
The population of Lebanon, where the story is set, relies on commerce and trade; and Lebanon's foreign policy had been thoroughly influenced by Syria until 2005. In the movie, Zain is approached by a young Syrian girl who is selling boxes on the street. The girl told him about how she and her family received food, which was provided by a ""food bank"" for Syrian refugees. Zain pretends to be Syrian in order to get food and baby formula for him and the baby. Lebanon has many diplomatic relations with countries all over the world. Syrian refugees in Lebanon face many problems, including debt. Lebanon is already in a financial crisis, mainly due to the pandemic and the blast at the Port of Beirut. The poverty rates are rising every year. While the middle class is becoming poor, the poor are becoming extremely poor. The Lebanese government estimates around 1.5 million Syrian refugees as of 2020. Worsening economic and political instability has forced many people out of their countries and towards Lebanon. However, Lebanon is working with important international organizations such as Anera in order to help the refugees find places to live. 
In one scene, we see Rhail sitting with a queer couple - a transgender woman who sells snacks and a parking attendant who wears a spiderman costume and calls himself ""cockroach man"". The gender rights in Lebanon are not as progressive as they are in the United States, but the LGBTQ community is more free in  Lebanon than they are in other parts of the Arab world. There is a Penal Code that ""prohibits having sexual relations that are ""contradicting the laws of nature"", which is punishable by up to a year in prison"". In 2016, the Court of Appeals of Beirut stated that a transgender man is allowed to change his official identification after undergoing sex reassignment surgery. 
Capernaum does not have a specific theme besides exposing the reality of the lives of these people. We see corruption, racism, and moral dilemmas that Zain goes through, including the adults that are to blame for his poor way of life: his parents.
This is a neo-realistic drama and the way it is shot is almost documentary-like. It is very captivating and closely connects you to the characters to make you feel compassion towards them as they are suffering. 
I definitely recommend watching this movie. As I said at the beginning it is very eye opening and made me want to learn more about the current political situation of Lebanon and maybe find out how I can help.",4.5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Dani G,Singin In The Rain,"The quintessential 1950's Hollywood musical. A good, fun production with good musical numbers, with just the observation of a very long sequence near the end that doesn't make sense to me, apparently there just to fill time",4,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Nikki F,Singin In The Rain,"This was such a clever, funny movie!  It’s a biting satire of Hollywood nonsense.  It feels fresh and modern, even today.  The humor reminds me of Mel Brooks.  Debbie Reynolds stole every scene she was in.  The dance scenes were really great — especially the one with Gene Kelly and Cyd Charisse in the speakeasy!  This is one I would definitely watch again.",4.5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Aleks I,Singin In The Rain,"The performance of the musical acts accompanied by the ""tap dance"" culture, the discovery of the diction educators immerse the viewer in the understanding of the cultural transition. The dialogues, though written decades ago, resonate surprisingly with today's humor - we seem to find in them the energy of modern words like ""flop"" or ""cringe."" Never has an old film failed to hold my attention completely, and even deepen it towards the film's denouement.
The song and the ""Singin' in the rain"" scene after the film ended remains etched in my mind. It is precisely the expression of overcoming difficult moments and personal boundaries, opening up and welcoming the new with a smile and an umbrella in hand in the rain, giving a sense of abright future. It's a timeless film that everyone is well advised to watch, for certainty they will enjoy it.",4.5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Stephen L,Singin In The Rain,"Singin’ in the Rain holds up as one of the great American comedies – not just a musical, but a whip-smart satire of Hollywood itself. The film takes aim at the transition from silent films to talkies with energy, irony and intelligence. Gene Kelly is magnetic, Debbie Reynolds holds her own admirably and Donald O’Connor nearly steals the show with his effortless comic timing and boundless physicality.

Its most famous sequences – “Make ’Em Laugh” and the titular rain dance – are deservedly iconic, but the film’s real strength lies in how consistently clever it is. It’s light on its feet but rarely empty. Hollywood has made plenty of movies about itself – few this sharp or this joyful.",4.5,5

Although I was about to be tired of the musical, I naturally teared up a lot at end of the movie. I guess the characters are simply positive and unrealistically beautiful. I wish I'd live in that world. I can't say Lina Lamont is a bad person.",3.5,5

The class song and dance holds true to this day and remains an iconic scene. I think that all people should go out and watch this film because it offers a history lesson. This film is monumental to where we are in filmmaking today and for that i am thankful. People tend to ignore older films such as this one, but I encourage those to really watch this film and take in what was made before. While I didn't like it as much as others, I really appreciate it for what it is and its impact.",3,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Javier M,Singin In The Rain,"I’ve always wondered as to how many within the industry felt in regards to the transition of silent to sound back then during those times. I really loved how Singin’ in the Rain dives deep into this. It is such a great musical though, I really love the performances, but mostly as mentioned before, it’s take on the Hollywood transition of silence to sound, it’s mainly about adapting to change. You see how many struggle with this as it’s something completely brand new to them. I could only imagine how hard it would be to transition into something new when you’ve spent a better part of your life doing it another way. In this case, it’s about acting. These characters spent their lives focusing on their mannerisms as they partook in silent films just for now their voice also matters in their acting. This also feels like a love letter for those times and a feeling of so much nostalgia for those times, so much love is poured in for the silent era. This also has you taking a look at the many egos in the film industry, filled with so many difficulties, many are out there to survive on their own and will do anything to ensure their success that can be seen here in Singin’ in the Rain. Overall though, this film is to say the least; iconic. I loved this and really did appreciate just how great it was all around. From the singing pieces to its more dramatic moments.",5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,anthony t,Singin In The Rain,"Going into Singin' in the Rain I was a spectacle because its a singing-heavy film, a musical in a sense. But I can't speak too soon because I said the same thing about other musicals, and I ended up liking them. However, a reason why I felt gravitated and fully immersed into this film was because of its plot in general. It was so interesting to see one industry transition from one trajectory to another. We get to see Hollywood's transitional period from silent films, to full on singing and audio. I find it amazing how well this film was directed, from beginning to end, and overall the casting choices made. We follow two main actors who are transitioning with Hollywood itself, and trying to fit in into this new realm and era of movie making. Disregarding their fame and position, you cant take away how bad someone's voice is. Which is the case for this film. Overall, I enjoyed this film from start to finish. It was refreshing to watch, or I myself love to see transitional periods within an era or person. And of course it's more so like a behind-the-scenes film of film sets, which I liked even more. I would highly recommend this film to whoever has been holding back from watching it, or has yet to see it. Its fun, charismatic, and magnetic in general, a film you won't forget. Truly unforgettable.",4,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Miriam F,Singin In The Rain,"Singin’ in the Rain (Dir. Gene Kelly, Stanley Donen) is a musical comedy centered around a Hollywood star by the name of Don Lockwood. Don Lockwood is constantly playing the role of romantic interest for his co-star Lina Lamont. They are both huge stars and audiences have made them out to be a sort of power couple. But of course, they’re far from that. Don hates Lina with every muscle in his body but Lina is this sort of naive and clueless character who believes Don is in love with her. The film is set in a time of transition from silent film to talking pictures and when a project is determined to work better as a musical, Don and his team must find a way for Lina to be in it without using her voice because she can not sing and her normal voice is far from pleasant. So they cast Don’s actual love interest, Kathy Selden as Lina’s singing and talking voice without giving any notice to Lina. For the majority of the film, I felt sympathy for Lina because it seemed like no one really cared for her as a person but only as a public figure that they could control. They wouldn’t even let her speak at events because they felt it would ruin her image. Although her actions went against Don and Kathy’s relationship I felt a sense of satisfaction when she walked into R.F. Simpson’s office and proved everyone wrong about her being naive. She was in full control up until the last scene where they still managed to make a joke out of her and she ran off the stage. I enjoyed the moments between Kathy and Don and I am 100% on Kathy getting credit for her own work but it feels like that happened at the expense of ridiculing someone who didn’t ask for a voiceover. Then again, Lina did insist on giving that speech herself.",4,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Eliza B,Singin In The Rain,"While the singing aspect of Singin’ in the Rain is important because it uses back catalog songs from the era the film is placed in, some of the musical numbers seemed unnecessary, not doing anything to further the plot or give insight into a character or character relationship and instead being shoehorned in. While the singing itself and the performances are excellent, the whole movie pauses, some characters sing and dance, and it starts again. Musicals in general do have a tendency to take the audience out of the film a little bit, but it does seem that some of the songs could be better incorporated into the overall plot. The film is optimistic and bright and sticks with that theme throughout. The main characters are likeable but some of the actions of the antagonist, Lina, don’t make a lot of sense. She doesn’t have a real reason for most of her actions except for being the antagonist in the plot. The film is fun but the writing and story lacks complexity. There are some fun shots such as the sound stage scene and the setting of the entire story, clearly on sound stages, makes for a fun sort of behind the scenes feeling. I did enjoy the time setting and the challenges that the main characters face as a result of the transition from silent to sound film. It makes an interesting setting that shows some of the challenges that come with film production in a comedic and lighthearted manner.",4,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Yeet 1,Singin In The Rain,"I feel like singing in the rain is awfully nice to studio executives by making the owner/ceo/big man in charge look like a friendly old man. It does a very good job of showing how scary and stressed out a director can be especially when Roscoe Dexter gets frustrated with Lina’s high pitch voice messing up the microphones. I have had similar issues with microphones on my own film sets, which since I don’t do sound much I am as familiar with microphones as the crew in this film was. Luckily I would like to do color grading anyways so my lack of skill in dealing with sound probably will not affect me all that much. I think that Singin In the Rain doesn't actually go deep enough into the issues of recording sound, especially recording sound in that era. For example they could have made a gag about the sound deadening used in early sound stages. Which was just a bunch of mattresses stuck to the walls. They could have also shown some of the spotlights where you had to strike a spark in order to turn it on. Or even they could have shown how dangerous old c-stands are when they slowly loosen and then fall near you. It makes me kind of sad at the amount of lost opportunities they have lost by using a modern film sound stage. Honestly it even feels pretty lazy how they depict early film production in this movie. It definitely could have been a lot better.",4.5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Nyla E,Singin In The Rain,"Singing in the Rain is absolutely marvelous and has set the standard for musical films in Hollywood. It’s influence is seen in many other musical films and in pop culture. Oddly enough film is incredibly nostalgic for me but I had never seen the film in its entirety up until now. My family and I would sing a long to the sound track and watch videos of the musical scenes but I had never sat down and watched the film. Watching it after all this time and putting the pieces together I’ve grown to appreciate the film more now than I did before. The music, the choreography, the vibrant colors of the film are amazing and bring us to that broadway type of feeling where everything is over the top. Bigger choreography, bigger smiles, more color, just more of everything. This film is also unserious at times and the songs don’t push the plot of the film forward like how a song in a musical usually does. The story of this film involves the transition from silent films to talking pictures. It shows Hollywood’s adjusting period or the struggle Hollywood had to go through to get through this transition. Like in the scene where Lina had to keep redoing the scene because they weren’t catching the sound, every time she’d move her head away from the mic the sound would go in and out. I think this film is such a success due to the joyful singing and dancing but also it also shows the history of cinema and Hollywood’s capability to constantly adjust to change in technology and art.",5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Willian F,Singin In The Rain,"Singin' in the Rain (Cantando na Chuva), is a classic that never loses its shine! As someone who is usually not a fan of comedy films and classics, I was surprised by the good energy and the perfection of the performances. I must confess that I was very curious, especially because of the famous scene of Gene Kelly singing and dancing in the rain, and the film surpassed all my expectations. Donald O'Connor is flawless. And the tap dance choreography has never seemed so fun. The music and dance scenes are simply unforgettable, and the film is a true antidote for any bad day. As one of the best musicals of all time, it is also a masterpiece of American cinema that remains current with every viewing.",3.5,5

Rotten Tomatoes,Ray T,Singin In The Rain,"This is such an enjoyable and entertaining film, it is lighthearted and the story was both innovative to the evolution of sound in the film industry and well written. Could be that I’m a musical genre lover myself. It marks Hollywood transition to sound and embrace it entirely, almost showing off what they have, adopting a social relevant topic. 

I really like the character arc of Don and Kathy. One being the charming silent actor adapting to the new technology and him prioritizing Kathy’s talent and love over deceiving the audience. On the other hand, Kathy just shines her way into the industry. The fact that Lina’s character contrasts with Don reminds me of Norma’s character in Sunset Boulevard, and their characters were just so compelling.

I especially love the scene of Don singing in the rain to express his love to Kathy, it was so iconic of cinema history. The film, the well used music and soundtrack stand out from the rest, as it’s so perfect that as if I’m actually watching a theater show myself, the choreography, interactions between characters, and the long continuous shots amazed me.

On the other hand, it is a visual feast, the use of Technicolor not only add vibrancy to the story, it also emphasizes the film’s joyous vibe and upbeat tone. Highlighting the humor, romance within the musical show. I find this film refreshing to watch, superb production design and high-quality productions. It set the standard for musical films and received critical acclaim within the cinema world.",5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Eric D,Singin In The Rain,"When you watch this movie, you're transported to a time when everything is vibrant, joyful, and full of wonderful energy. I got hooked by the film's ability to achieve a balance between humor and such a well-written storyline from the very first moments. The movie greatly explores the shift from silent to “talkie” films, which is an interesting era to relive for anybody interested in the history of film. Gene Kelly's performance as Don Lockwood perfectly captures the charm and vintage appeal that drive this film. You almost forget you're seeing something staged during his famous ""Singin' in the Rain"" performance because he makes everything look effortless. Additionally, Kelly's portrayal is balanced by Debbie Reynolds's realness as Kathy Selden, which makes their interaction an important aspect of the movie. Although I truly enjoyed the story, I believe the musical parts are what make this movie truly stand out. Even while each song and dance routine is amazing on its own, they are so effortlessly incorporated into the plot that they complement it rather than distract from it. Singin' in the Rain feels timeless despite taking place in the Hollywood atmosphere of the 1920s. One small criticism would be the pace in some scenes, but overall, the vibrant atmosphere and incredible performances more than make up for it. Although I wouldn't give it a five-star rating, this movie reminds me why I enjoy musicals. I understand why it's so popular, and I strongly recommend it to anybody hoping to experience some vintage Hollywood charm.",4.5,5

Elem Kkimov had a pretty well fleshed out, impressive career, with a body of work that's almost universally well regarded. COME AND SEE was his *last* film.. perhaps that got tangled up in translation? 

Anyhow--i don't view the film as a 5 star masterpiece, sometimes the German soldiers are rendered with a silly pantomime of villainy (a mistake often made IMHO in a high portion of wwII melodramas... the Germans are portrayed as well nigh brain damaged mountebanks.... streamers of spit dangling from their chins the only thing missing) but it's definitely a tour de force of brutal filmmaking, well communicating the steady diet of violence that constituted the daily bread of those subject to the war on the Eastern Front. . . ie WW2's Operation Barbarossa.",4,5

Rotten Tomatoes,Mackenzie S,Come And See,"I felt the emotions of this masterpiece in my flesh, blood; bone. A predominantly wordless script was 110% the move for this film, for many reasons. Most importantly, it relied on the incredibly talented cinematography of Aleksei Rodionov and extraordinary acting of Aleksei Kravchenko to communicate the absolute terror and impact of the atrocities of the second world war felt and inflicted upon innocent citizens, especially children. Kravchenko's eyes communicate so much more than his words alone could have--what this production represented through the work and expression of these artists is significantly more substantial than 
- again - words alone would have been. 
The film is crude, appalling, and disturbing. It evoked emotion in concentrations and quantities that made it difficult for me to finish the film. I was terrified. I cried. I find the weight this film carries to be so valuable. I can name few other times a work has transported me to such a contemplative, furious, helpless and regretful state.",5,5
Rotten Tomatoes, ,Come And See,"This movie is objectively one of the scariest horror films ever made. I first watched this movie back in 2022, and it didn’t scare me at first because I’ve seen a lot of terrifying war movies in the past, and this one didn’t throw me off across the board… But after rewatching this movie multiple times, I was shivering in fear of what I was watching, and to think about the fact that this actually happened brings the heaviest chills down my spine, and I do not say that lightly to any extent whatsoever. This movie is beyond amazing, and I’d argue it’s one of the greatest war movies ever made just because of the impact it brings upon its viewers. It drags you into the absolute chaos of what World War 2 was like and how deranged and despicable humanity could possibly be. It is crazy to discover that this movies title actually came from a Bible verse in the book of Revelation when Jesus opens the Fourth Seal. If someone were to ask me the question of, “Is this movie worth watching?” Well… It depends on whether you’re brave enough to accept history and understand that facts remain facts. Words cannot describe the immense feeling that this movie brings. If you think Schindler’s List was terrifying… You have no idea what this movie will do to you afterwords. I cannot emphasize how important this movie is. It’s definitely a hard movie to watch but I do think this is worth watching if you’re brave enough. We cannot repeat history, and we need these kinds of things to be taught in school! Watch at your own risk!",5,5

Rotten Tomatoes,Leonardo L,Come And See,"""Vá e Veja"" é um filme de guerra soviético de 1985, dirigido por Elem Klimov. Este filme é amplamente considerado uma das representações mais realistas e perturbadoras dos horrores da Segunda Guerra Mundial, especificamente a ocupação nazista na Bielorrússia.

A trama segue Florya, um jovem de 16 anos que se junta aos guerrilheiros soviéticos na luta contra as tropas nazistas. À medida que o filme avança, ele testemunha uma série de atrocidades cometidas pelos alemães contra a população civil. A narrativa não só expõe a brutalidade da guerra, mas também explora como o trauma transforma o jovem protagonista.

O filme se destaca por sua abordagem visceral, evitando o glamour ou a romantização comum em muitos filmes de guerra. Sua fotografia e trilha sonora criam uma atmosfera de pesadelo, intensificando a experiência emocional para o espectador. ""Vá e Veja"" é reverenciado por sua autenticidade histórica, performances poderosas (especialmente do ator Aleksei Kravchenko como Florya) e sua direção inovadora.

Tenso e perturbador, é considerado um dos melhores filmes de guerra já feitos e uma obra-prima do cinema mundial.",4,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Kristen H,Requiem For A Dream,"Requiem for a Dream is as disturbing as it is artistic—a brutal, visually striking descent into addiction and obsession. Darren Aronofsky doesn’t hold back, and I wouldn’t expect anything less from him. The film sticks with you, not just because of its subject matter, but because of how masterfully it’s told. It’s not an easy watch, but it’s a necessary one.",5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Gage H,Requiem For A Dream,"This is a movie that you watch once and then you never need to see it again.
God forbid you are smoking during this because this will make you never want to touch drugs again. 

Good movies are made to elicit emotion from the viewers. However, that doesn’t mean it needs to be a good emotion.. in this case it is disgust and anxiety.

Everything else is done to perfection. The movie is able to easily get points across to you without having to show you specifically what’s being done. 

This might be one of the best uses of split screen that I’ve seen in a movie for a while. Not to mention the scenes where certain people are sped up and others aren’t. Brilliant stuff. 

Lastly, the score is terrific. It really builds the tension and queues the audience in to an important moment. 

Overall this is a well filmed & acted movie. The topic and the way it makes you feel prevents me from going any higher than 4 stars.",4,5

And Requiem For A Dream pulled me right into its story so early and it never lost me. I love how emotionally impacted and stressed out you’ll feel watching these characters in this movie, and a lot of that comes from the unreal performances by the entire cast. I love the films sound design and score, and the uniqueness of how they handled the editing and cinematography. The way it also handles its message of addiction felt extremely realistic and accurate, which just added to how much I was biting my nails as the film went on.

Rotten Tomatoes, ,Requiem For A Dream,"I know it’s a very popular film, and I understand why so many people like it but I just don’t. It’s upsetting because I almost feel as if I didn’t give it a chance. I may return to this one in the future just to see my take on it then, but for now I didn’t care for it. The lady that played Sara Goldfarb gave a magnificent (and I’m not using that term lightly) performance. During her scenes I felt disturbed in a way that could only be described as… cringe? But it wasn’t cringe it was just shocking. Only Saving Private Ryan has gotten that kind of reaction out of me before I saw this. So that tells me I need to rewatch this film some time soon, I think I’ll really enjoy it. Seeing Marlon Wayans in a movie other than scary movie (or just a comedy in general) made me laugh. That’s not to say he didn’t do a good job though, because he definitely did. Jennifer Connelly was just ok, and Jared Leto was decent. 2/5 stars.",2,5

Rotten Tomatoes,Jonathan K,The Hunt 2019,"I liked the world they tried to build and the way the story unfolded with a bit of mystery, but I was kind of hoping it would be better, and definitely funnier. The satirical humor never quite works. Maybe it represents too strong of stereotypes. I’m not sure you even really root for the main character, and there’s just not a lot to care about. It’s not a smart, sharp social commentary like ""Get Out"", there’s nothing very clever here. It’s just a little too on the nose in a brazen way, and it doesn't totally work.",2,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Michael A,The Hunt 2019,"It's goofy, it's fun.

Rotten Tomatoes,Tobias K,The Hunt 2019,"If you see this movie as a source of entertainment only, the bloody kill count and the top notch down-to-earth performance coming from Betty Gilpin will be enough for the 90 minutes to come.

But I can say that, even though it's cultural very different from US movies, it is near perfect in almost every way. It's character driven and Kurosawa builds characters here that are almost too real. It feels vey different from American movies but it's so easy to get lost in the thoughts and feelings of the people portrayed. Takashi Shimura is nothing short of inspired in the lead role. I don't have anything to add that hasn't already been said, but take the 2hours 23min and I don't think you will be sorry.",5,5

Rotten Tomatoes,Hector I,Ikiru,"One of the master's finest films! The story of a paper-pusher who, on learning he's going to die, wakes up and tries to live, but above all tries to do something good for the community. 

His son won't talk to him, wants his money and his colleagues despise him.

But he has found the strength to act through the rabbit girl. The funeral scene is superb: at first, his colleagues agree with the deputy that the park isn't Watanabe's, but one man stands up to say that it isn't. It was he who made the park, despite all the difficulties. 

Then, everyone recalls a detail of the project, and all the locals come to pray, his stubbornness in overcoming the administrative barriers, all the barriers despite the mafia. The scene where the construction starts and we see his face lit up, by God? A beautiful scene. Then his colleagues begin to realize the kind of man he was at the end, and in their drunken stupor decide to change.

Months later, something unfair happens and his colleagues haven't changed a thing, except for the man who defended Watanabe first, who looks on. 

The closing scene with the swing is superb, with Watanabe singing under the snow of his accomplished work, no longer afraid of death and no longer having time for enemies. 

There's subtlety here, and you'd expect people to exclaim that he's a holy man, but there's none of that, no easy feelings here.

A powerful indictment of the administrative society of the 1950s.",5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Jay W,Ikiru,"I didn't know what to make of ""Ikiru"" as I began watching it. I had not heard anything about the film. I watched it because it was a Kurosawa film, and even if they don't feature samurai, Kurosawa makes great films. Our main character, Kanji, is told that he does not have long to live. Kanji has spent his life working for the government. There is an amusing montage showing how the red tape of government work prevents anything from being done. Given this ultimatum of life, Kanji begins to reevaluate things. He tries to find happiness.

At first, I thought I had this movie figured out, and I thought it was fine. But then it takes a turn. After this turn happens, this movie upgrades from fine to spectacular. I won't say what that turn is, but when it happens, I was blown away.

Life is short, but this film is still worth your time.",4,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Taylor T,Ikiru,"This a thought-provoking and deeply humanist portrait of a man in the final days of his life. Faced with the realization that he has immersed himself in a life-long career seemingly dedicated to accomplishing nothing of importance, he desperately tries various methods of bringing meaning to his existence. 
When pursuits of personal pleasure do not work for him, he finally realizes that helping others -- especially those who are essentially powerless -- is the key to his salvation. That process is shown in retrospect, utilizing flashbacks and the testimonials of his survivors. Shot in 1951, just six years after Japan's defeat in World War 2, the film depicts a city in near-ruin and a populous in the throes deprivation, not only physically, but in terms of morale. It can be difficult for modern, Western audiences -- especially those who do not understand the language and must rely on subtitles-- to grasp the entirety of the film's meaning. It is one of those films that can benefit from multiple screenings.",4,5

Rotten Tomatoes,Merick H,Ikiru,A masterpiece from one of the greatest directors of all time.,5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,A R,Ikiru,"The 'what would you do if you only had X amount of time to live?' trope is pretty tired at this point, but Ikiru takes an incredibly inventive approach and has beautiful performances and excellent cinematography to bolster it. The third act in particular could've been skipped altogether, but does a great job engaging the audience further - sure you think you would change how you live, but would you really? 

It goes without saying that Shimura crushed this role - his consistently deflated expression holds so multitudes and it's genuinely hard to look at it. He was so pitiful it made me mad - I did not want to see his face anymore. I'm particularly fond of the scene where he goes to the parks department and just sits there making everyone uncomfortable with his tragic face. I also loved Odagiri's performance - she's such a real person despite a character archetype that often feels unreal, undeveloped, and fantastical (obviously the writing takes some credit for this as well).",4,5

Rotten Tomatoes,Il B,Ikiru,"Ikiru: “To Live”

We are all alive, each and every one of us. But are we truly living?
As individuals, we are caught up working, for hours, months, years, decades without realising, we are not truly living. 
Life is precious, yet we are wasting it. Ask yourself, in all of these years you have been alive, have you truly “lived”? How many hours of your life have you wasted? How much could you have accomplished in that wasted time? Yet we ask ourselves, why we shouldn’t waste time, why should we work, when we will all eventually succumb? What is the purpose of life?
We shall never find out in this life, but perhaps we shall in the next. 

Kanji Watanabe is a bureaucrat, who has been working in the same boring department for the past 30 years. His life has so far been meaningless, monotonous and dull. 
After continuous pain in the stomach, he proceeds to visit a physician, where he finds out he has less than a year’s time to live, due to stomach cancer. 
After days of depression, Kanji sets out to spend his remaining time truly “living”, yet it is not quite enough. 
He wishes to leave something behind...

Rotten Tomatoes,Christopher B,Ikiru,"Kurosawa's most personal and moving film to date for me.  Touching, poignant, and utterly human, Ikiru is a triumph of human will and life itself.  Takashi Shimura delivers a powerhouse performance as both a young man, in flashbacks, and a gray haired old man full of regret in present day.  After losing his wife, he spends the next 30 years going through the motions in a meaningless job and forgetting to actually live.  When he is diagnosed with stomach cancer he is given only 6 months to live, and it's at this time he decides to finally live life to the fullest.  Sad, hopeful, thoughtful, trying, and so raw with emotion that you feel Watanabe's (Shimura) grief foremost but also his hope.
    Ikiru proves that Kurosawa wasn't just a master of samurai films and can handle a human drama with the utmost care and potency.  Any film that can push the viewer to think about their own life and what it is that they are living for has done it's job when trying to show the meaning of life and what it is all for.  While the film is grim and at the beginning downright hopeless and sad, once Watanabe finds his reason to live finally, he has renewed purpose and drive and lives his final months at the fullest.",5,5

Rotten Tomatoes,yash b,Ikiru,"""Ikiru"" is a devastatingly sad but truly moving human drama. This is one of those classic films that just have a timeless appeal because of its profound and universal themes. I think at some point, whether young or old, we have all tried to find some sort of meaning in our lives and we all live with the fear that our time can be cut short at any moment. This film explores complex themes about life with a beautifully realized story. I think the movie is a bit on the slow side, but it is definitely very engaging once it gets started and it is certainly a film that will stick with me. Overall, out of the Kurosawa films I have seen so far, I think this is one of the best and universally accessible stories in all of cinema.",4.5,5

Rotten Tomatoes,Frans B,Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind,"Better pay attention right from the start to end. Very intelligently written and directed. This movie made me think on subjects that never really crossed my mind, but it makes sense to question it. The concept is quite unique and should peak interest, highly recommended",5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Silas  A,Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind,"A masterpiece. A brutal, beautiful, mind-shattering masterpiece.

I am at a complete loss for words—no review, no analysis, nothing could ever fully capture what I just experienced. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind didn’t just break me; it obliterated me, pieced me back together with trembling hands, only to rip me apart all over again. It is raw, devastating, and achingly human in a way I was not prepared for.

I can’t believe this is my first time watching it. Eternal Sunshine, the album—my all-time favorite—makes so much more sense. Every lyric, every emotion, every bit of longing and heartbreak Ariana poured into it feels even more profound after witnessing the film that inspired it. This isn’t just a film; it’s a visceral, emotional labyrinth of love, memory, and loss.

The storytelling is nothing short of genius. The way it manipulates time, the way it forces you to feel Joel’s desperation, Clementine’s chaos, their joy, their destruction—it’s suffocating, intoxicating, and utterly unforgettable. The cinematography mirrors this perfectly: hazy, dreamlike, disorienting, yet deeply intimate. It pulls you into the confusion, making you question what’s real, what’s lost, and what can never truly be erased. I cried. 

I don’t think I’ll recover anytime soon. Five or six weeks might not even be enough. This film lingers, embedding itself in your thoughts, making you ache for something you can’t quite name.

Perfect. Absolutely perfect.

Rotten Tomatoes,Itandawy A,Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind,"For this movie, it was complicated to understand a little bit but i soon got to understand more about it by the end of it. It is an amazing movie about  it's message that tries to make us understand the crazy, chaotic, adventurous nature of what the relationship between these two characters had and how they came together once again. For the quality of this movie of how it was made is very well done by using different types of lighting (like using just a flashlight, dim lighting with candles or house lamps, as well as sunlight) and camera motions that like shaking or having moments like the camera was walking with the character but also jumping in different directions and different places with one camera motions without cutting!

The setting was good and the set design was beautiful at times. The plot was also extremely interesting. The movie was confusing at times but I think this helped out the overall plot. I think the confusing aspect of this movie allows it to be interpreted by each person differently. Overall, this was one of the best movies I’ve ever watched.

Rotten Tomatoes,damaris g,Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind,"A philosophical, sci-fi, romance drama taking place in the year 2004, starring Jim Carey as Joel and Kate Winslet as Clementine, his girlfriend. The first time I watched this movie I didn't quite understand it until I watched it for the second time. This movie goes into depth about how the pain of erasing/forcing yourself to forget someone you love so deeply and genuinely is worse than remembering and cherishing. This movie moved me so deeply and had a very valuable message to it that I hold wholeheartedly and had me in tears by the end. 
This beautiful, genius film directed by Michel Gondry follows two past lovers who deeply loved each other but had a messy breakup. Following their split, Clementine dealing with the strong emotions of the breakup, sought out the company, Lacuna. A company that specializes in the procedure of erasing one's memories of a person. Joel finds this out after his friends tell him. This results in Joel too, getting the procedure done. In the moment of getting Clementine erased from his memory, he finds himself wanting to “call it off” to keep these memories that are slowly slipping away. Filled with regret he realizes he still loves her. 
The plot of this movie is similar to some messy relationships that don't end up working out and people who bad mouth their ex-lovers not wanting to admit that deep down, they still have so much love for them. This film might help us realize how we often take these memories with people we love for granted and how in the moment, we don't truly appreciate them until we don't have it anymore. How loving someone and getting to know them for their true self is a privilege people don't often come around. Throughout the movie, I was shown this with Joel's memories. While being erased, replaying those vulnerable moments and memories of a person who he once loved and wanted to marry; soon to be gone. How soon Clementine, was going to be just another stranger to him after all of it. 
Throughout this film, it's shown that love is strong despite differences, whether in personalities or looks. Joel is introverted, shy, calm, and scared of vulnerability but is in love with Clementine because she is bold, happy, sensitive, impulsive, and possibly even has undiagnosed bipolar personality disorder but Joel saw past that. It is shown that Clementine's free-spirited impulsive personality drove Joel to do things out of his comfort zone. This is shown in scenes when Clementine wanted to go to Montauk and they ended up at frozen lake the first night they met again after having their memories erased. Despite Joel being afraid and worried the ice was going to break, he was willing to lay on the ice lake with her. Joel loved her for her and went out of his comfort zone for love. Some people think that being polar opposites ruins the movie but I love it and think it's perfect and different from any other movie.  
 The small details in this movie made it amazing. With Clementine’s hair changing all the time it gave the viewers a timeline of their relationship but had a deeper meaning. To some viewers, her colored hair could have just been something she liked to do, but I noticed each color meant something. When Clementine first met Joel, she had bright green hair with her roots growing out. Green means new beginnings. During their “honeymoon” phase, she had red; meaning love. Nearing the end of their relationship, she dyed her hair orange; meaning arrogance.  Clementine was sometimes arrogant and her arrogance could've been a reason for their breakup so this tiny detail was incredibly smart when looked into deeper. Charlie Kaufman, the writer, was so genius for this as the meaning behind this detail was so tiny but also so deep. Her hair color was a reflection of how their relationship was going. 
Overall, the message behind this movie was powerful and the acting was beautiful. Despite Joel and Clementine having a rough breakup leading to them both getting their memories erased. In the end, they still found their way back to each other and were willing to work it out even if it meant it'd end in another heartbreak. They were willing to see past each other's mistakes and realize they were human and not perfect. Towards the end of the movie, after they had found out they both had their memories erased, Clementine and Joel were in the hallway of Joel's complex. There it was exchanged words, “I'm not perfect.” Clementine said “I can't see anything that I don't like about you.”- Joel “But you will.” -Clementine “Okay.” said Joel. This small conversation exchanged between them was so heartbreaking but says so much. Love is powerful and when 2 humans are meant to be together and I believe they will always find their way back to each other and work for it. Loving somebody is never a mistake, it's a privilege, and it is beautiful.",5,5

Rotten Tomatoes,ed h,Reservoir Dogs,"The movie opens with a really interesting, funny and captivating introduction. The questions this scene elicits on first watch is a truly unique experience. 

The entire movie is shot beautifully - the shift in stability really does mirror the character's mental state; most apparant in scenes like Mr White and Freddy entering the warehouse, where the cinematography makes the scene strangely intamite and powerful; especially on rewatch.

The story is interesting, if I'm being picky it is basically a big game of among us or mafia. Tarintino tells it beautifully though and I feel the pressure exuding through the screen, and genuinely distrust the characters. 

The casting is, on the most part, superb. Buscemi's the standout, and it was a genuine pleasure to watch such skillful portrayel of a slimy rat scarpering around the sewer. For me, Keitel's acting was, in places, strange; it felt pretty forced at times and a bit awkward. 

The chemistry amongst the cast was palpable; a key example of this is through Penn and Madsen's characters. They balance precariously between a brotherly relationship and genuine sexual tension. I was half expecting another story showcasing their romantic relationship. This tension builds throughout the movie and does climax wehn Eddie confronts Freddie about Vic. 

Some aspects of the movie felt overlooked - namely in the costume department. Whilst I know it sounds nitpicky, it took me out of the immersion when I noticed the lack of blood and dirt on the suits - namely Vics suit when he goes to the car after 'talking' to the police officer. But this issue is also across the movie. 

Ultimately, I really like the movie. I'd reccomend it to almost anyone and I think they'd enjoy it.",4.5,5

Rotten Tomatoes,Birithivy Y,1001115-Apartment,"The Apartment - 10/10. What a sweet and dour film. Bittersweet to its core, and surprisingly heart felt. The Apartment follows a lovable pushover/loser (played ever so brilliantly by the late great Jack Lemmon) who just so happens to be the holder of the apartment for mischievous happenings in his apartment. Wanting a promotion and not to be a troublesome sore to his cheating bosses, he lends his apartment to them to continue their toxic behavior, while he sadly has to mope and bide time till their done. But fate has him tied up with his boss and the elevator operator/mistress (played amazingly by the effortlessly charming Shirley MacLaine). What's incredible about this film is how far ahead in time this story is. I'm actually a bit shocked a movie of this nature was made in its time. Its beautiful in showing how this sweet individual, who just wants to be loved and good to the world, ends up being used and pushed around. Beautiful in a sense when the final portions happen, where he finally gains his spine and does things his way, it makes for a triumphant emotional experience. Also, loved the way the movie makes connections to lines and convos from earlier in the film, its so nicely done and never feels forced or out of the norm. This also happens to be, in a strange and odd way, a beautiful melancholic christmas/holiday film. It shows you how human connection (genuine, human connection) matters. And how that said connection can help save a life (literally), give hope to one, and also make you realize that you should stand up to greedy individual and make sure they know your morales and mentality are never compromised. I got super emotional here, cause I too have gone through moments in life where I unknowingly (and knowingly) have been used. So at the end, when the happy ending came to the lovable character, it gave me hope. We all deserve happiness, whether it be during the holidays or not. Good people don't finish last: they just have more beautiful stories. Never compromise your soul folks. It's what makes you, you!",5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Jim D,1001115-Apartment,"Can I give it 10 stars?  Billy Wilder’s 1960 comedy romance is at once prescient, tender and heartbreaking all at the same time.  Before most people even knew the term ‘sexual harassment’, writer-director Billy Wilder was giving us a film that skewered the world of corporate sexual escapades and extra marital trysts.  Not only does THE APARTMENT inform the audience about the goings on behind closed office doors, but it also entertains by giving us the story of two young people over their heads in a world of sharks.  Can Baxter and Miss Kubelik escape the soul numbing world of corporate sexual harassment and back handed payoffs to find true happiness?  See THE APARTMENT to find out.",5,5

This is indeed a timeless film, and as I continue my odyssey through all the Best Picture winners, I'd be shocked if this doesn't rank among the very top of the heap. The cast can't be improved upon, and the two leads give arguably career best performances. MacLaine, in particular, is revelatory here and achieves a beautiful combination of strength and vulnerability. When she's onscreen it's virtually impossible to look elsewhere. Sparkling dialogue, scenes alternately hilarious and heartbreaking, pitch perfect direction and editing - this is what happens when everything falls into place, and it deserves to be considered a classic!",5,5

Rotten Tomatoes,A R,1001115-Apartment,"There are so many things to love about this movie, Billy Wilder's screenplay and Shirley Maclaine's performance chief among them. In many ways, I think the execution was basically flawless. Despite that, I found myself a bit bored at several moments - I think the premise is just somewhat lacking, and no amount of perfect execution can make up for it. I think it might've drawn me in more if we spent more time with our leads, developing their connection through dramatic dialogue. I also struggle with the nice-guy trope that is CC... he's ultimately sort of underdeveloped and we don't spend a lot of time with his moral dilemma. He spends a lot of time helping Sheldrake at Jubilee's expense, but we're supposed to think he's a good guy the whole time. If the looming loss of a job felt more realistic and threatening, I may have accepted this behavior, but it wasn't discussed enough, leaving him feeling very yucky to me.",3,5

Rotten Tomatoes,Tom F,Lawrence Of Arabia,"Beautiful looking, depending on your tolerance of desert landscapes. Remarkable performance by Peter O’Toole of a shameless self promoter who believes his own mythology. Frames war as a story that needs to be packaged as an adventure of honorable heroes, while clearly showing it is anything but.  The depicted meddling of Western powers into Arab affairs continue to ripple through history.",4.5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Merick H,Lawrence Of Arabia,"This film is beautifully shot, powerfully scored, and the first half is fantastic. But in the second half of the film, a little after they take Aqaba, the story itself seems to lose direction and purpose. The pace of the story really picks up; the motivation for the character's actions are not always clear--we never really get a clear understanding of who Lawrence is, why he wants what he wants, and why we, as an audience, should care. There is not enough character development for us to really care about any of the secondary characters either. The first half of the film is excellent and there are some compelling aspects of the second half, but the story itself is just not that good. The ending is interesting, but anticlimactic and unsatisfying. Being held in such high regard, ultimately, it was disappointing. In the scheme of things, the film left me wondering if TE Lawrence's existence mattered at all. What did he accomplish, really, and what difference did it make? This might sound cold, but it is not clear to me if this is a figure worth remembering--not to mention, immortalizing in a four-hour epic.",2.5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Luca D,Lawrence Of Arabia,"Get comfy because this movie is a long one. Is it worth it in the end, definitely.

Rotten Tomatoes,r96 s,Lawrence Of Arabia,"227 minutes of greatness!

I've always wanted to watch 'Lawrence of Arabia' given its standing as being one of the greats, though that rather long run time always put it on my subconscious back-burner. At last, I rooted out some time for it and man it was a well spent near four hours! I'm not going to say its length is ignorable, though it truly doesn't feel like a 3hr 47min movie - so every credit to all involved.

Peter O'Toole's performance is undoubtedly outstanding, I can't really add anything more to what I'm sure many, many others have noted down the decades - he is, put simply, brilliant. Other strong performers are Alec Guinness, Anthony Quinn, Omar Sharif and, albeit more minorly, Claude Rains. No-one on the cast puts a foot wrong, as expected.

The cinematography throughout is also absolutely exquisite, the entire look and feel of the film is just stunning. There is much more to say about this but I'll leave that to those that have already said such things. I'm just here to watch great movies and this 1962 picture is unequivocally one of those. Quite evidently a classic, no doubt about it.",4.5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,nick s,Lawrence Of Arabia,"Wonderful cinematography, great sets and impressive action scenes. Worth watching for that alone. 

But the movie drags a little over it's huge runtime and seems to lack focus. The script was a bit on the theatrical side, especially later in the movie... the characters more focused on saying something profound than communicating. 

Also a pity they couldn't find Arabs to play all the Arab roles. Alec Guinness in particular was rather conspicuous. And the titular character was quite odd. Not sure what they were trying to say about Lawrence with Peter O'Tools muddled, half-bewildered interpretation. Probably no reflection of the historical person. 

Overall I loved the eye candy but not a huge fan of the character arc or story line.",4,5

Rotten Tomatoes,James M,Scarface,Classic and superb! Hard and hilarious,4.5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Sergio A,Scarface,"Brian De Palma always knows how to get the most out of everything, but this film easily has 30 minutes too many. If he wasn’t going to properly close his characters’ arcs, that runtime felt unnecessary. The performances are strong overall, except for Michelle Pfeiffer (even though I adore her), who isn’t at her best here.",3.5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Kione Kennedy-Houlstead Percussion Source S,Scarface,"Brian De Palma’s Scarface is not just a film—it’s an experience. A blood-soaked, cocaine-dusted, neon-lit descent into the heart of the American Dream turned nightmare. With a powerhouse performance by Al Pacino as Tony Montana, the Cuban refugee turned ruthless kingpin, this 1983 crime epic remains a brutal, stylish, and haunting mirror to ambition unchained.

Pacino doesn’t play Tony—he becomes him. Every line delivered with volcanic intensity, every scene dripping with unchecked hunger. His journey from dishwasher to drug lord is Shakespearean in scope, tragic in consequence. But beneath the bombast and violence lies something deeper: a story about the cost of power, the isolation of success, and the myth of invincibility.

Oliver Stone’s script crackles with iconic lines and nihilistic poetry, while De Palma’s direction is a masterclass in tension, decadence, and visual storytelling. Giorgio Moroder’s synth score pulses with menace and grandeur, elevating scenes into moments of operatic excess.

Scarface may have shocked critics upon release, but time has solidified its place as one of the greatest gangster films ever made. It’s not subtle, and it’s not meant to be. It’s explosive, unapologetic, and unforgettable. Say hello to one of cinema’s boldest achievements.",5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Dumont S,Scarface,"Violento, estiloso e trágico. É uma montanha-russa de excessos, ambição e queda. Al Pacino entrega uma atuação inesquecível como Tony Montana, um personagem tão carismático quanto autodestrutivo. Um clássico que continua impactante.",3.5,5

Rotten Tomatoes,Mitch W,Scarface,"This movie is actually pretty bad. Money for movies was scarce in 1983 and it shows in Scarface. Lacked innovation or imagination, it was poorly done, tactless, cheap. If you want to see an Brian DePalma movie you should see Snake Eyes, its much better.",1,5

Rotten Tomatoes,AmMaR s,Scarface,"Scarface (1983), directed by Brian De Palma and starring Al Pacino as the infamous Tony Montana, is a gritty, intense crime drama that explores the rise and fall of a Cuban immigrant who climbs the ranks of the Miami drug world with ruthless ambition. Pacino's electrifying performance and the film's unforgettable quotes, like “Say hello to my little friend,” have made Scarface a cult classic. Beyond the violence, the movie explores deep themes of power, corruption, and the American Dream. It remains a timeless film that continues to influence pop culture.

While far from perfect -- there are a few hard-to-ignore plot holes, and some      of the voice-over narration by Raymond Chandler teeters dangerously close to self-satire by today's standards -- the film works, thanks to a diabolical story and an iconic femme fatale turn from Barbara Stanwyck.",4,5

But most of her movies are terrible and not funny for anyone over 6 years old.   Personally I feel she is a very good actress but seems to take any script given to her.  Bridesmaids was great writing and her role in that movie was perfect.   Sandra Bullock probably helped boost the rating.  It was an older movie but much has not changed in her roles.,2,5

It's like a comfort food in terms of movies. The dynamic between Mccarthy and Bullock is hilariously dysfunctional yet they somehow end up making the perfect crime fighting duo. The writers put the perfect amount of depth to each character to make it a interesting plot without being too hard to follow or too dull to stay awake. The pacing of the movie is perfect in my mind, and the jokes never stop flowing throughout, while managing to capture some emotional moments too. It's got it all. The credit really goes to the actors (even the side characters like Kaitlin Olson, Tony Hale, Bill Burr, and Dan Bakkedahl) who play the characters perfectly, making it such an enjoyable watch. I will never get tired of this type of comedy, it's the best medicine in the world.",5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,SkyRo P,The Heat,"In the movie ""The Heat,"" starring Sandra Bullock and Melissa McCarthy, the comedic duo promises an entertaining and hilarious adventure from the get-go.

While the film does have its flaws, like any comedy, with some moments that may come off as cheesy and not quite fitting seamlessly into the storyline, Sandra Bullock's quick wit and comedic timing elevate the movie. Her presence on screen brings a level of charm and humor that keeps the audience engaged.

Melissa McCarthy's performance in the film is commendable as she plays off Sandra Bullock effortlessly, adding a touch of goofiness and humor without crossing the line into annoyance. Despite a somewhat cheesy storyline, the chemistry between the two leads shines through, making the movie a worthwhile watch. The comedic rapport between Bullock and McCarthy creates a dynamic that is both enjoyable and entertaining, making ""The Heat"" a film that is definitely worth checking out for a good laugh.",4,5

The cinematography and visual language are top notch even for Hitchcock standards. The iconic plane scene is very impressive for the time and is the highlight of the movie alongside the climax on Mount Rushmore. The twists are unexpected, but well-woven into the narrative and keeps you guessing about what’s really going on. Carry Grant is terrific and his female co-lead does a great performance despite her agency getting stripped away to mostly being a damsel by the end even though she’s the professional agent and he’s just an advertiser mixed up in all of this. Aside from that, this movie is damn near perfect and easily deserves all of its praise as one of Alfred Hitchcock’s finest works.",4.5,5

Rotten Tomatoes,Ted B,North By Northwest,"4.5 stars;    Along with ""The Man Who Knew Too Much,"" ""North by Northwest"" are by far the best spy thriller movies that Alfred Hitchcock made. In fact, I would put them on a list with the best movies that Mr. Hitchcock made. So many twists and turns lead to the final outcome. This movie keeps you guessing because it is so very well constructed.

Cary Grant plays the debonair, wealthy playboy who, as an innocent bystander, gets wrapped up in a high-level spy ring. Eva Marie Saint plays his love interest and does a great job of keeping you in the dark as to whose side she is on. James Mason and Martin Landau give good performances as the evil adversaries.

Yes, I know that the plot is somewhat of a stretch, but it doesn't matter. This movie is loaded with gripping suspense. That's what you go to the movies for—to be thrilled! There is a light touch of comedy and romance to round out the story.

Rotten Tomatoes,B A,Citizen Kane,"This film might not be for everyone, especially the younger generation today, but anyone familiar with the life of William Randolph Hearst or interested in the history of filmmaking should consider it an absolute must-see. It's incredible that Orson Welles was only 25 when he co-wrote, directed, produced, and starred in this monumental production.",5,5
Rotten Tomatoes, ,Citizen Kane,"Slow. Slow. Slow. It's not witty. A rich guy who is a self-centered narcissist makes his fortune bigger, loses it, constantly buys statues and on his deathbed says a word that reminds him of his sled from childhood. Orson Welles is a great actor, but this movie is just not good.",0.5,5

Rotten Tomatoes,Brennan W,Citizen Kane,"The first time that I watched this film I really didn't like it because I though it was super boring and the twist in the end was anticlimactic. Once I watched it a second time, my opinion on the film has completely changed. I found that the character of Kane was really interesting because of his development in how he was taken from his home and lost his sense of being a child. He was forced to grow up in a capitalist home and for that resented his adoptive father for what he did. I found that the twist of rosebud was actually pretty interesting because of the impact that the word has on his character but also the action that are shown throughout the film. From how he spends money on his home and clutters it, cheating on his wife to pursue something fun, and how he dies alone thinking of his past. The is film is a pioneer in terms of filmmaking and for that should be something that everyone should watch.",4.5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Javier M,Citizen Kane,"This is a must watch, a film worthy of many and many rewatches. My one word description of Citizen Kane would be that it is indeed a masterpiece. Directed by Orson Welles, it has been released for over eighty years and counting and it is often regarded as one of the greatest films ever made. I share that sentiment as I think it is a sensational product. It carries that tag of being one of the greatest for a good reason, it set new standards for film and its use of narrative structure is just incredible. In the film, you see the rise and demise of Charles Foster Kane. I just love how many points of his life are shown within this, from a boy to a young man, to the middle-aged, until he’s at his oldest. Orson Welles delivers a stellar performance here from the young Charlie to his end. Kane’s rise to power through the ventures of the newspaper bring him great wealth, fame, and influence but this ultimately leads to his fall, as he tries to run for political office but loses after the news of an affair goes public. Great stuff all around, especially the direction by Welles himself. This film is a landmark in the history of cinema, its influence is still being felt around the state of the industry even if it was released many many many decades ago. Watching this is an experience, one that is essential for someone interested in film, for a lover of cinema. To me, this is easily a certified five stars.",5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Miriam F,Citizen Kane,"Citizen Kane (Dir. Orson Welles) is a mystery about a reporter trying to uncover the meaning of millionaire Charles Foster Kane’s last word, “rosebud.” It is through people who once knew him, such as his friend Jedediah and his mistress Susan, that we learn about Kane’s life. We learn he had an abusive father and a mother who thought it was best to send him off with a banker named Thatcher, after receiving his newly gained wealth. When Kane first meets Thatcher he was playing in the snow with a sled and we are given the answer to the film’s mystery and principal question without even knowing. In fact, I completely dismissed it until the end of the film. Kane’s life was full of riches and privileges but it seems as though he was always trying to fill a void with that money. He buys a newspaper called the New York Daily Inquirer, marries the president’s niece, has an affair with a singer by the name of Susan, and builds an estate called the Xanadu. Kane undergoes what could possibly be the worst case of retail therapy ever seen by filling his estate with expensive art pieces. At this point in the film, Kane has no one but Susan left and even she ends up leaving him. Kane begs her to stay but not for her sake, but for his. Kane had all the money in the world yet not a single soul next to him. It is revealed in the last moments of the film, when a few workers are burning some objects from his collection, that a sled with the word, “rosebud” is thrown into the fire. Even with all the money he had and everything he had experienced, Kane could not forget the one good thing about his life before power and fame. Perhaps the only good thing about his life was a mother that genuinely cared for him.",4,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Eliza B,Citizen Kane,"Citizen Kane surprised me. Not only does it have several innovative and creative technical aspects, it also has an excellent and compelling story. The acting is fantastic and while Orson Welles portrays a complex and entertaining Kane, my favorite part of the film is when the reporter is interviewing his old friend Jedediah who keeps trying to sneak his cigars. The influence of Citizen Kane can be seen in the majority of films. It is a masterclass of visual storytelling. One of the technical aspects I enjoyed is the use of depth in different scenes. For example, when Kane is a boy and you can see him through the window while the adults have a conversation. The storyline is compelling and has a lot to say about success and wealth and whether or not it is worth the sacrifices of other people that have to come in order to make someone obscenely wealthy. In the end, Kane is alone, in his castle with all his possessions. It doesn't seem worth it and the premise of the film, with the investigator trying to figure out what “rosebud” means, is an excellent frame for the entire story. What adds to Citizen Kane is how it is loosely based on William Randolph Hearst, furthering the critique of wealth present in the film by incorporating elements of the life of a real person. Citizen Kane has a lot to say and is particularly valuable to watch for anybody who wants to write or make movies.",4.5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Nyla E,Citizen Kane,"I was thoroughly surprised that I liked watching Citizen Kane and did not understand the hype behind the film before watching it. But I can see why Citizen Kane has been viewed as transformative for American cinema. This film is legendary for its use of deep focus and how it contributes to the storytelling of the film. I feel many people deem them as innovative and new but I’m sure that Citizen Kane isn’t the first film to use deep focus but its the way the film applied deep focus which helps with the composition and the overall storytelling of the film. A shot that I love in particular, which I’m sure many people have analyzed is when Charles is playing in the snow, and the father is in the middle ground and the mother signing papers with Mr. Thatcher  in the foreground. The composition adds many layers to the scene, by having the father in the middle ground, because he’s fighting for Charles’ mother to not sign the papers puts him in a lower position than she is. And having the mother closest to the audience, in the foreground creates kind of like a pyramid of hierarchy. And in this scene since it is her decision to sign the papers she is more superior, or on top of the pyramid. By having Mr. Thatcher right under Charles’ mother but in front of Charles’ father, shows that he is there assisting the mother in her decision and also has somewhat of a superiority over Charles’ father. And Charles in the background playing with snow is oblivious to what’s going on inside, the lowest tier in the pyramid. There’s many things to dissect in this film, I’d suggest this film to anyone who wants to experience the greatness that is Citizen Kane and for people who like to dissect composition, lighting etc.",5,5

Rotten Tomatoes,matthias s,Up,"*Up* didn’t hit me as a kid, but rewatching it now? Man, that first sequence absolutely wrecked me—in the best, most cinematic way. Pure storytelling brilliance. Pete Docter is a genius, and you feel it in every frame. The movie's stacked with layers: grief, joy, adventure, talking dogs—what more could you want? It’s hilarious, heartfelt, and somehow never loses its charm. The visuals? Gorgeous. The colors pop, the skies feel endless, and the camera work is surprisingly artful for an animated film. Sure, it never quite climbs higher than that unforgettable intro, but the ending still had me in full teary-eyed mode. It’s just so *pure*, you know? A rare kind of film that makes you laugh, ache, and smile all at once. I can’t recommend it enough—even if, like me, it didn’t click the first time. Sometimes, movies find you when you’re finally ready for them.",4,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Blu B,Up,All Time Classic. If you told me the plot of this I would look at you and think your a little nuts. Especially when getting to Kevin & the army of Talking Dog Henchman. But it's quirky and memorable set of characters and amazing execution is what makes this so good. The editing and pacing is masterful and thr animation is first rate. Everything else is really good. The villian is good and original but a little out of left field somewhat. But the subjects it explores and the message of never being too old for an adventure is timeless. Everyone should give this a try once.,5,5

Rotten Tomatoes,elana k,1012928-M,"Everything about this film is deliberate. Nothing feels superfluous. The audio-visual restoration (and recovery of missing scenes) by the Europeam team of film technicians must have been a labour of love and a real celebration of Fritz Lang.  This old film with all its modern technical finishes is something to enjoy in its own right. This a valuable piece of early film noir and German history. I particularly enjoyed the blending of the humourous mood with the seriousness of the subject matter. This early contributor to what would become known as film noir rivals the multiple successors in the genre with its entertainment value and element of surprise and challenges other works in the genre which are too dull in their treatment of pessimism. The character of M delivered a superb performance in the final act, with the lighting and cinematography as excellent artistic flourishes which supported and enhanced the dramatisation. This is a cinematic masterpiece.",5,5

Rotten Tomatoes,Andrew W,1012928-M,"Modern audiences may find parts of the movie slow, but that should not keep you away from a great film. Peter Lorre surely shows his acting skills in the final scene, assuring that he deserved every accolade he ever received.",5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Wayne K,1012928-M,"One of the most acclaimed films from one of the most acclaimed filmmakers, M was released during what was, in retrospect, a very bad time for Germany: The rise of Nazism. It's something of a miracle the film even got made at all, and an even bigger miracle that it was released. But this all plays into what makes the film work so well. Lang detested what was happening to his country, and as such he portrayed it in the least flattering light. The entire city looks like that neighbourhood our parents warned us to stay away from. Dirty, sleazy and full of unsavoury characters, one of whom just happens to be a child murderer. Like a lot of early 30s films there's a lot of talking, which, for me, can be just as boring as a film where no one say anything. There's long scenes of rambling, exposition heavy dialogue to set up the plot, and it's all edited together so quickly that you might lose track of it. It also becomes somewhat repetitive when the hunt for the killer commences, as it feels like the same scenes are being played out time and time again just from different angles. But the quiet moments are very effective. Peter Lorre, previously known for his comedic work, plays a compellingly disturbed baddie, and the moral question about who gets to judge who is given a lot of weight. It seems Fritz Lang was ahead of everyone on the concept of the court of public opinion and justice being determined by the heart rather than the head. As Lang films go, I was more enamoured with Metropolis, simply because I was more interested in the overall story. But there's no way you can watch M and not appreciate the craftsmanship, the pioneering work and the well-deserved legacy that it still has to this day.",4,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Luca D,1012928-M,"Have to say the ending was very disappointing. Peter Lorre carried the movie and oh my god I barely recognized him with all that fat in his face. Great plot I just have to say I was underwhelmed. For it's time I suppose it must have been very daring but compared to the other ""must see""s it's really not all that enticing. Felt myself wondering why I should feel sympathy for Peter Lorre at the ending after literally no character development on him in the entire movie. None of the characters are really developed at all. The plot and Peter Lorre's final scene are the only thing that makes the movie worth watching.",3.5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Elvis D,1012928-M,"Una película buena, en realidad, que se gana cierto mérito por inspirarse en un caso real y ser la primera película sonora de Fritz Lang. Peter Lorre es muy destacable en esta cinta con su oscuro personaje. A pesar de la falta de música de fondo, el silencio igual ayuda con la intriga y tensión de la cinta. Esta película tiene una buena trama, pero requiere de una mente cinéfila para poder comprenderla y adentrarse en ella, ya que esta película puede llegar a ser aburrida por tanto misterio, pero interesante para aquellos dispuestos a adentrarse en la historia. No es exactamente mejor que Metropolis, pero es una película respetable y por eso le doy un 8/10.",4,5

Rotten Tomatoes,TWMax65,1012928-M,"This movie has a lot of social, cultural, and historical significance for the time when it came out, mainly reflecting the mob mentality and collectively angry tendencies that the people of Germany were susceptible to just before the Nazis took over. The movie started off very well with well-crafted camera work and the story felt tense in a few parts. However, I feel like it ended somewhat unevenly and throughout the film I missed some of the smaller details of the plot that took place and it eventually felt like I missed something big that went on. Having to read and keep up with the subtitles lost me a few times but still, the film was powerful for what it represented and mostly well made.",2.5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,johnathon w,1012928-M,"Classic crime noir thriller that works as drama along with being a political commentary on the treatment of crime and its criminals.  While most of the cast is unrecognizable today, Peter Lorre gives a brilliant performance as the suspected child killer, showing he is both sinister yet a victim for his crimes, even making you almost feel sorry for him.  Behind the camera, Fritz Lang expertly explores the larger implications of a serial killer, from citizens turning on one another to criminals joining the search for the murderer, not so much to catch him as to get the police off their backs.  It also works as an early procedural, showing the police use forensic science to track down the killer.  All in all, a breakthrough film and true classic by any measure.",5,5

Entertaining though this is, the momentum & focus is quickly dissipated by a ""Good Morning Vietnam"" interlude before the war action finally arrives. 

Whilst illustrating the seeming futility & lack of clear military purpose of the Vietnam war may have been one of the director's key purposes, it doesn't make for particularly rivetting viewing until the last 20 minutes of the film when the on-screen tension & brooding industrial soundtrack combine to at least send us all home relatively satisfied by the overall cinematic experience.",3,5

However, the true story arch was always centered on Joker. The film is much more complete and powerful when honing in on his journey, an intellectual saddled with more empathy than an infantryman might like, he can see through the BS, but is he ultimately capable of harnessing the most primal of actions when a higher understanding demands it in the name of both mercy and necessity?

And the Technicolor colors! And the shot compositions (especially all those involving mirrors)!

The script does seem a bit contrived, though nowhere near as contrived as ""Rear Window,"" which I find increasingly worse with increasing distance (?!). And James Stewart is THE face of Hollywood cinema in the 1940s and '50s, but I still don't consider him a particularly good actor.

In any case, I highly recommend it; it already hints at some of the things Hitchcock would later explore in ""Psycho"" and ""Marnie.""",4.5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Kyle C,Vertigo,"Excellent psychological thriller which is ahead of its time in a lot of ways. Hitchcock pulls what later becomes one of his signature moves: giving us a main character with questionable morals to whom it gets harder and harder to relate as the film goes on. In this case, James Stewart’s performance anchors the character’s emotions and allows us to infer a lot without a particularly rich backstory.

The film is dated in a few ways, too, especially in the way that men and women interact. Sometimes it works to its benefit, making us even more uncomfortable than audiences probably would have been in 1958, but other times it feels incidental and just icky. And personally, I found the ending to be slightly disappointing – a bit of a copout. I would have loved to see it continue its darkening trajectory to really question John’s sanity and morality, rather than taking the easy, tragic way out.

Lastly, it almost goes without saying that this film is visually stunning. The colors pop like nothing I’ve seen from this era, and Hitchcock’s masterful work of the camera throughout the city really takes it over the top. In Vertigo, San Francisco itself feels real and alive, like a character in itself, waiting to be explored and felt (on-location filming surely helps this aspect). Overall, a few minor flaws have appeared over the last 65 years, but this film is arguably timeless and set a new standard for thrillers.",4.5,5

First off, I don't think people talk about this movie's cinematography as much as they should. The colours are vibrant and so distinct, and Hitchcock has made his cinematographer capture California in such a beautiful airy glow. This movie delves into a man's obsession. It's interesting, because Hitchcock worries more about how it happens than the effects of it. Its slowly taking over Stewart's character, and we see as the movie runs along, the poor man being stricken with a love that ends up taking over his life.

Rotten Tomatoes,Kevin P,Vertigo,"A thrilling psychological thriller from Alfred Hitchcock that hooks you with its engaging noir mysteries unraveling with so many legitimately surprising dark twists and turns and some intriguing commentary on mental health that feel mostly ahead of its time. The thoughtful visual cues of the color red and green were cleverly implemented along with a mesmerizing score by Bernard Hermann and some excellent performances by Jimmy Stewart and the rest of the cast (Midge’s characterization and performance felt refreshingly realistic for a female character that isn’t an outright love interest and can casually command the room). There are some beautifully visually stunning art sequences with the vertigo dreams as well as a really hypnotic dream-like feel to the whole movie with the alleged possession scene. The ending was a bit rushed with some questionable conclusions about gender roles and could’ve used one last epilogue, but everything else is expertly crafted as easily one of Alfred Hitchcock’s best works.",4.5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Nol P,Vertigo,"Take any great movie of the past.  Vertigo as just 1 single example.  There has been almost zero movies since 2019 that are even close to as good as any classics of the past!  Most movies are only time fillers now and most of which I want my time back!
Joker and Top Gun Maverick are only 2 more recent entries I can come up with that achieved a rare 10 out of 10 score!  I have yet to see Oppenheimer still as per so super long (but on my short list to see still) and Barbie received a super solid 8.5!
Agree?  You must!  The amount of sequels and lack of new ideas is only PATHETIC!

Rotten Tomatoes,Dan  R,Vertigo,"1958's 'Vertigo' saw Hitchcock produce an exceptional thriller but also a deeper and darker look at love, loss and human comfort.

SYNOPSIS: 'A former San Francisco police detective juggles wrestling with his personal demons and becoming obsessed with the hauntingly beautiful woman he has been hired to trail, who may be deeply disturbed.'

The film is one of Hitchcock's most lauded movies even though it wasn't very popular on its release.

It's a gorgeous looking film, like an artist's masterpiece, which focuses on one man's obsession of the woman he's supposed to be investigating.

Not only does Hitchcock demonstrate a total mastery of cinematic point-of-view, but he turns what might have been a boring crime caper into film poetry.

Stewart and Novak are just perfect in their roles. Their chemistry is electrifying.

A perfect movie.

Once the action from the first climax died down, it took a while for the film to rev back up to the second climax, so there was a good chunk of the middle of the film where my interest was completely lost. Good on Hitchcock for finding a way to regain that interest and make the rest of the film worth watching. I only wish there was a little more consistency in terms of how interesting the film was - I was always either enraptured or thoroughly bored. One star off for this consistency problem.",4,5

Rotten Tomatoes,Martin F,A Separation 2011,"An unforgettable drama that perfectly captures how messy life can turn even when you do your best to get it right. If the ongoing separation between the couple is the first source of issues for our characters, it develops into something more sad and complicated as each little choice on how to take care of the divorce has strong consequence.
It's a hard-hitting movie as their problems are sad but also relatable. Between family, mental illness, money or trust, it's hard to not feel each character's (especially the father's) desperation and to not be able to make a clear decision on who is right and who is wrong.

As an Iranian movie, it also gives you an overview on the Iranian culture through their justice system, the implication of the religion or the clothes which give a fresh point of view when we are used to Western movies.",5,5

Rotten Tomatoes,Matthew B,A Separation 2011,"Asghar Farhadi's 2011 drama, A Separation, is an exercise in building empathy. The viewer is presented with various layers of conflict that separate people. Gender and class are divisive factors here.

The film raises a series of moral problems. At various points the viewer might feel tempted to take sides, but as the facts fully emerge, it becomes clear that everyone has a good reason for their actions, no matter what mistakes they make.

In the film's opening scene, we see a husband and wife facing a family court judge. They are sat together, yet hardly look at one another, reflecting their apartness. Simin (Leila Hatami) has filed for divorce from Nader (Peyman Moaadi), her husband of 14 years, and yet she says that he is a ""nice, decent person"". 

The breaking point is Nader's father (Ali-Asghar Shahbazi). Simin wishes to leave the country. Nader had previously agreed to this, but his father has Alzheimer's, and he wishes to care for him. ""Does he know that you're his son?"" asks Simin. ""I know he is my father,"" Nader replies.

She cannot get a divorce because her reasons are not considered good enough. Nader is not an addict; he does not beat her; he is not failing to provide for her. She cannot take Termeh with her if she leaves Iran.

""Judge, I've come here for you to solve my problem,"" complains Simin. The judge responds, ""I'm the judge and I'm saying that your issue is small.""

ader needs a carer to look after his father while he is at work. He accepts Razieh (Sareh Bayat), a pious woman who struggles with the job, partly due to her being pregnant. She often wraps herself in her headscarf as if to comfort or protect herself.

Razieh is not sure whether it is a sin for her to change a man's clothes. At one point the old man wanders off on his own, and she has to dodge between traffic to reach him. Matters reach a crisis when Nader comes home early to find Razieh absent, and his father lying on the floor. There is evidence that Razieh has tied him to the bed.

He roughly throws the protesting Razieh out of the house, and she falls over. Soon after he learns that she has lost her child.

Why did Razieh tie up Nader's father and leave the house? Did Nader know that Razieh was pregnant? Was Razieh's miscarriage due to her treatment at the hands of Nader? Why does Simin not leave the country as she said she would? And why does Termeh choose to live with her father, and not her mother?

Asghar Farhadi slowly reveals the information that will answer these questions with the skill of a mystery movie writer. In the process he establishes the first of many areas of separation in the film – the separation of truth from lies. 

A Separation shows us the importance of being truthful, but also the many good reasons why a number of characters choose to conceal the truth from others. To tell the truth may have disastrous consequences for some of the characters here. Yet it is only when we learn the truth that we can have full understanding and compassion for others.

Nonetheless when the truth arrives, it is shattering – literally. We see broken glass, indicating that one person is unhappy with the outcome.

The characters are often physically separated. They view each other through doorways and windows. Farhadi often places objects in front of the camera, even when this blurs the camera view. Termeh often views the action through a door or window. She is excluded from making any of the decisions concerning her parents until the end of the movie when she is finally empowered to make an important choice.

Farhadi creates a naturalistic effect with the use of handheld cameras. The film has no music score during the action. Instead Farhadi trusts that the story is of enough interest for intelligent viewers to be appreciated for its own sake.

A Separation is essentially a humanistic work. Religion may motivate the characters, but there is no overbearing piety. The film's appeal and its poignancy lies in seeing how its flawed but well-meaning characters seek to find the best outcome for themselves that their society allows.

Rotten Tomatoes,,A Separation 2011,"A movie to feel - A Separation

The director of the Iranian film ""The Divorce of Nader and Simin"" Asghar Farhadi did not limit himself to the framework of a family drama

The very first scene, and immediately a family conflict of such intensity, the author will be able to maintain the set pace for the entire two hours of the film.

The film is thin, unusually psychologically authentic. And I am sure that in it, as in a mirror, anyone will see a reflection of a topic that is relevant to them.

Asghar Farhadi shows us believers and truly religious people not as satirical fanatics, but as simple, but more responsible people. People who have additional moral barriers. Although, in fairness, Asghar does not give out ratings. It is no coincidence that almost every one of the characters in his film will not be able to come out unsullied from his personal test. Almost everyone lies or knows the bitterness of perjury.",5,5

Rotten Tomatoes,dave s,A Separation 2011,"Set in Tehran, a young Iranian couple find themselves in front of a magistrate in order to facilitate a separation, not because of a lack of love or an infidelity, but due to a moral dilemma.  She wants to take advantage of an expiring visa and have the family move out of Iran in order to give her daughter a better opportunity at life.  He feels that he is unable to leave due to his obligation to take care of his elderly father who suffers from Alzheimer's, all of which leads to an unimaginable chain of events.  Asghar Farhadi's A Separation is a film filled with characters who struggle to do what they believe is the right thing to protect their interests and their families.  It is compelling throughout, filled with believable dialogue and scenarios, naturalistic acting, effective handheld camerawork, and an ending that will break even the hardest of hearts.

Un regista pazzesco che col passare degli anni si è guadagnato il rispetto del mondo del cinema.",4,5
Rotten Tomatoes,William L,A Separation 2011,"Feel that? That's the combination of moral grayness and empathy washing over you. The response that A Separation may give you certainly doesn't trend towards ""warm and fuzzy"", but even if it's uncomfortable there is no denying its power. 

I love tough films about human nature that deal with complex characters, they're the best; this 2011 Iranian film by Asghar Farhadi revels in its tough decisions, crafting a vitriolic and devastating (yet entirely plausible) modern-day conflict between people that each retain a bit of kindness and cruelty in themselves. Nobody in the film is explicitly evil, they are the culmination of their past experiences, present circumstances, and personal desires, the embodiment of the phrase ""people are not against you, they are for themselves"". Actions taken measure individual benefits against the risk of harm to others, or emerge out of simple, irrational emotion or personality flaws; take for example, Razieh (Sareh Bayat) facing limited time to take care of her daily tasks, and deciding to leave her senile patient alone and tied to a bed for some time. Nader (Moaadi), the patient's son, comes home and sees a cruel act and a broken promise, while Razieh thought of it as an unfortunate necessity as a result of her financially unstable household. Thus, every conflict is a battle of perspective and circumstance rather than objective right vs. wrong. 

From this potent foundation, Farhadi builds a sweeping story that expands from base human nature to a portrait of modern society in Iran, focusing on the state of social and religious influences as well as class conflict and disconnected government influences. Along the way we keep this claustrophobic, uncomfortable perspective that lets even small confrontations loom large, creating a consistently taut atmosphere that never lets you turn away. And yet, it doesn't feel like there is a moment wasted here, as the story builds organically and in a compelling manner. Despite any cultural divides, I was absolutely absorbed in the screenplay, the performances, and the outcome.

And random note, this is the first film where I've seen someone with the title of 'Investor' in the opening credits.

And that's every movie from every edition of the 1,001 Movies You Must See Before You Die released to date! Going out on a high note. (5/5)",5,5

Rotten Tomatoes,Eddie N,Clockwork Orange,"I watched this movie as it is one of the classics, or so people say. I don't get the appeal, the movie starts off by showing off a gang of goons and their sinister love for crime. The movie in its self is just violent for the sake of being violent there is no plot, it's almost as if it's trying to be as edgy as possible. We then see the main character get caught and be sent to what is believed to be a rehab center where he goes through different psychological assessments. At the end of the movie we come to find out that in reality the whole program is a failure and he won't ever find the help he needs. The story and plot twist is boring, further more you can't even relate or feel sad for him, he deserves it. The whole movie is very slow paced and boring and what happens on screen most of the time has little to do with the main plot, which isn't even good to begin with. I understand why maybe when it came out it was kind of a big deal but tbh it's boring, underwhelming, most of the action is irrelevant and the plot twist isn't even shocking. To add onto it they didn't even try to make you sympathize with him, even if you are somehow shocked by the most basic of plot twists there no feeling bad for him. Bad, boring and quite frankly overrated.",0.5,5

Rotten Tomatoes,Kevin P,Clockwork Orange,"Arguably one of the most controversial and polarizing films of all time. Even Stanley Kubrick himself had mixed feelings on the public copycat crimes in reaction to this film, as he pulled it from rebroadcasting, but ultimately still weighed responsibility of those crimes on the individual perpetrators. The movie starts out guns blazing and doesn’t pull any punches in its raw depiction of human cruelty through violence and sexual assault. The latter of which can be somewhat questionable for its male gaze elements and having Alex cross the line to where the huge sympathy boost in the second half of the film can feel a bit questionable at times. But to be fair, that can be more chalked up to common fan interpretations of the film’s subtext. Whereas I feel like the movie leaves it up to the audience in where to draw the line in how much of Alex DeLarge’s punishments and “rehabilitations” is justified. But I think it is certainly made clear and can be agreed upon that goodness comes from within and must be chosen in order to be genuine and long-lasting. The brainwashing and public backlash scenes are a nice contrast to the droods’ cruelty in the first half. Hell, the thugs are now cops doing the same violence, only now legally protected by the law. The movie is about human nature and evil and can it truly be understood and controlled. Or should we accept that even the evilest of men cannot be cured and are better off being locked up than lobotomized into an empty husk that won’t contribute to society anyways. The revenge scenes are simultaneously satisfying and pitiful. The acting is terrific and the cinematography, set design, costumes, and music is so hypnotic and uniquely engaging. All while the government tries to cash in and try to look good, but will betray its own morals just to save face when it backfires considering how often they flip-flop in their treatment of Alex as a villain and then a victim, yet they throw his retaliative former victim to the wolves of prison without a second guess just to save their precious re-election PR. The movie certainly isn’t for everyone and is not without its tasteless flaws, but it’s a very impressive piece of dark art that feels truly unique and mesmerizing.",4,5

Rotten Tomatoes,Jay W,Clockwork Orange,"I know I'm going to be stepping on some cinephile toes with this rating. It should be no surprise to them, Stanley Kubrick is a controversial director. With films like ""The Shining"", ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", ""Dr. Strangelove"" people either love them or hate them. ""A Clockwork Orange"" is probably his most divisive of his filmography.

Despite the review being lower than most, I don't hate the film. I think it has some good things going for it. The premise is interesting enough that I want to read the book the film is based on. I like the bizarre 70's British version of a suppressive government. The idea of taking a despicable human and then having him brainwashed to make him averse to evil, is a clever concept.

In execution, it is hard to watch. It is difficult to have a film without a central protagonist to root for. In typical Kubrick fashion, there are a lot of long takes. There is also a ton of nudity, and a fair amount of what they deem as ""ultra-violence"". You can call me a prude, but frankly, I don't like any of that.

Not a movie for everyone, and that includes, not a movie for me.",2,5

Rotten Tomatoes,Max A,Like Stars On Earth,"Like Stars On Earth is a very touching film about one of the most vulnerable and underrepresented groups: children with learning disabilities. In a modern world where everyone is expected to compete in society, neither family nor the school system is equipped to deal with those who fall behind. They would be treated as lazy and irresponsible, and their needs wouldn't be recognized.

One of the things the film does well is showing us in detail the world Ishaan (Darsheel Safary) comes from, being the second kid of a working-class family, with a brother that excels at everything — being this the metric his parents use to measure Ishaan's success — further complicates things. Then there is the school system. With overcrowded classrooms and underprepared teachers, there is just so much to be done. Verbal abuse — and later on, physical abuse — are the only techniques they know.

The film calls us to reflect further on the issue. We all know how Ishaan's story ends, but what about the thousands of other children who are trapped in the same school system the film tries to criticize?",4.5,5

The chemistry between a student and a teacher is hard to find in schools. A teacher who encourages and actually invests his everything in the betterment of his students is what every student needs.

Rotten Tomatoes, ,Like Stars On Earth,"(a ""Dear special child:"" film review by Timothy J. Verret)

""Dear special child:""

There are some films that just ""change the game."" They get us to look at the world in an entirely different and unique way. Such is this film from India, LIKE STARS ON EARTH. In fact, looking at the world in an entirely different and unique way is EXACTLY what this film is all about. It's about a ""Dear special child:"" who was led by a wonderfully special teacher to see how truly miraculous and special he was, is, and always will be. I would have loved to have seen this special film as a ""Dear special child:"" myself, as it would have ""changed my game"" and allowed me to embrace me as special as I was, is, and always will be.

Darsheel Safary plays the special child, Ishaan Awasthi, and it's a marvelous performance of absolute and complete originality. Any exceptionally gifted, young actor would have found it difficult to carry a nearly 3-hour film, but Safary is not just any exceptionally gifted, young actor. He is TRULY special, just as Ishaan is. With the young eyes of an old soul and those big buck teeth, Safary wins us over the minute he shows up in the film and he has our heart in every scene that follows until the triumphant end. Aamir Khan plays the wonderfully special teacher, Ram Shankar Nikumbh, and Khan, most definitely an inner child as an outer adult, wins us over, as well, with his creative and unique teaching style. The other teachers in the school don't know what to make of Nikumbh but when they try to make him over into the stringent and regimented teacher they are, Nikumbh faces them all and gives them the Nazi salute of, ""Heil Hitler!"" Priceless and very apropos! It's not the least that Ishaam is lazy and rebellious; it's simply the most that Ishaam has undiagnosed dyslexia. Words confuse him and cause him to have poor motor skills, as well. Catching a ball is impossible for Ishaam, because he can't understand the concept of the ball being thrown to him, unable to clock the actual distance from the ball, thus completely unable to catch the ball. Words hold this same concept of confusion for him. When Nikumbh figures out why Ishaam can't read and write, he sets out to address his dyslexia but Nikumbh does something even more remarkable than that: Nikumbh addresses Ishaam's creativity in painting where words cannot possibly fail him. Ishaam's parents are clueless about his dyslexia, as many parents unfortunately are, and Ishaam's father is hell bent on his children succeeding and winning. Ishaam succeeds and wins in ways his father cannot understand, and that is through Ishaam's creativity.

I'm not kidding you, ""Dear special child:"" Every single teacher and parent with a child and/or children should be mandated to watch this film. Teachers and parents need to understand that their child does not have to succeed or win because a certain teacher and parent didn't succeed or win in their own lives. Teachers and parents need to address each special child individually, uniquely, refreshingly accommodating to each special child's unique gifts and talents. The child might become the quarterback of a football team but the child also might become the painter who paints like no one else can possibly paint. The child might be the smartest kid in the class but the child also might be the most artistic kid in the class. This film inspires me to want to teach because I want kids to ""get this."" I want kids to ""get"" that they don't have to be who their teacher or parent thinks they need to be. They need ONLY be who they NEED to be. My parents wanted me to be a doctor or a lawyer for the rich career warranted. I wanted to be the artist I am now for the ""rich career"" of being enriched as the creative person God enriched me to be, monetarily rich or poor. It's these creative types like Albert Einstein, Leonardo da Vinci, Thomas Edison, all with learning disabilities, who ""changed the game"" and thus changed the world. It's these creative types who do God, The Original Creator, justice by creating from adversity to sheer originality.

I'm not going to let you, ""Dear special child:,"" get away without saying this:

""Dear special child:"" YOU ARE SPECIAL! You always were, are, and always will be. There is not one single thing you need to ""change about your game."" If your teachers want you to be who they want you to be, be YOU! If your parents want you to be who they want you to be, be YOU! There is no one else like you and there is no one else who will ever be like you. You are one-of-a-kind, unique, special, endearing, remarkable, marvelous….do you need me to go on? If you do, I will! I'm so grateful to God that He brought this absolute gem of a film to me at just the absolute right time, because I can often feel VERY ""unspecial."" This film reminds me and all of us just how special we were, are, and always will be. ""Like stars on earth"" indeed am I….and YOU!!!!

Unique and original blessings ALWAYS, ""Dear special child:,""

Rotten Tomatoes,David C,Die Hard,La actuación de Bruce Willis es buena esta es sin duda una de las mejores películas que ha hecho,5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Ralph R,Die Hard,"Die Hard (1988) is one of those action movies that just gets everything right. The plot is simple but brilliantly executed, keeping the tension high from start to finish. It does not waste time with unnecessary filler, making every moment count. John McClane is a great protagonist, not because he is an unstoppable action hero but because he is resourceful, vulnerable, and constantly thinking on his feet. The script balances action and humor perfectly, making McClane’s struggle feel real while keeping things entertaining.

The directing by John McTiernan is masterful, making every sequence feel dynamic without being chaotic. The cinematography uses tight framing and creative camera angles to keep the audience engaged, especially in confined spaces. The way the film plays with lighting and reflections adds to the tension, making even quiet moments feel suspenseful. It is visually impressive without relying on flashy effects, and every shot is carefully composed to enhance the story.

The acting is top-tier, with Bruce Willis bringing the perfect mix of charm, toughness, and desperation to McClane. Alan Rickman’s performance as Hans Gruber is legendary, delivering a calm and intelligent menace that makes every scene with him feel electric. The supporting cast adds depth to the story without overshadowing the main conflict. The score and sound design enhance the intensity, with well-placed music and crisp sound effects that make every gunshot and explosion hit harder. Die Hard is not just a great action movie, it is a masterclass in how to make one.",4.5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Mike P,Die Hard,Who would have thought that Bruce Willis after Moonlighting would have come up with this movie? This launched him into the stratosphere of big movie star fame in with the likes of Stallone and Schwarzenegger and stayed there to his latter day roles. Also deservedly launched the career of Alan Rickman who also never looked back. The whole premise of the story and the twist with the 'terrorists' just keeps it rolling along. The explosions the nastiness of the bad guys mixed in with John's wit and hero timing will keep you hooked. Best bit is the giant explosion and when Bruce meets Alan.......and then that fab nail biting ending. Yippeeeeee ki-yayyyy to you all,5,5

Nothing short of a visual and technological masterpiece, the film seems to have been unjustly forgotten since its release, however, overshadowed by Studio Ghibli's Spirited Away, which was released the year after. Loosely based on an early manga created by the legendary Osamu Tezuka (best known for creating Astro Boy and Kimba the White Lion), the film is a fascinating story that balances many complex and thought-provoking themes, such as political corruption, class struggle, the dangers of fascism, the relationship between man and technology, and, perhaps most importantly, the question of what exactly makes one ""human?"" The animation is some of the finest ever seen in an animated film. The fluidity of the characters' movement puts the best of Ghibli's work to shame, and at times rivals even Disney. At the same time the film makes heavy use of computer graphics, which haven't quite aged as well as the 2D animation, but were groundbreaking at the time. However, the film's visuals are precisely why it falls just short of ""great movie"" territory. The visuals too often overshadow the plot, and the character relationships and plot elements simply aren't developed enough to make quite the emotional impact the creators had undoubtedly hoped for, particularly at the film's climax. That being said, Metropolis is a tragically overlooked film that is a must-see for any lover of animated cinema.",4.5,5
Rotten Tomatoes, ,Metropolis 2001,"While confusing in the beginning, if you pay attention and last through the full experience, Metropolis culminates into one of the best and most emotional stories I've seen in any animated film. You'll be treated to a wonderfully drawn world that feels alive every step of the way, with old-timey music that is unlike any other film in it's genre. Astute viewers will understand more than just the plot, however. Indeed, Metropolis delivers a powerful and deeply thought out message commenting on the human nature, and what we consider to be worth calling human, or indeed, if that is even a question one should ask. It provokes thought about segregation that is happening even in today's society, where this is thought to have been eliminated long ago. Metropolis is an incredible achievement for animated film, and film in general. This is one movie that, if you call yourself a fan of the genre it belongs to, you have no choice but to see it.",4.5,5
Rotten Tomatoes, ,Metropolis 2001,"Overall plot was interesting and the story was mostly well-focused. The only thing I guess would be more character development from some characters, especially Tima. So there were times where I always felt they could do more scenes in terms of backstories for certain characters, as it's a movie, so I need to know them better. Ending felt hanging in the clouds sometimes, which is another thing that deducted my rating a bit.",4,5
Rotten Tomatoes,johnathon w,Metropolis 2001,"Superb adaptation of Osama Tezuka's classic graphic novel in that it takes liberties from the original story, making it a true cinematic experience while staying true to the spirit.  The vocal cast is superb across the board while the filmmakers deliver one of the best animated movies in recent years.  Director, Rintaro, and writer Katshuhiro Otomo expertly adapt Tezuka's novel, keeping the themes but making changes needed to condense it into a 2 hours movie (something Otomo brilliantly did with his own ""Akira"").  Some characters are even added, despite fitting in perfectly (Rock is a notable example).  The story remains the same, using robots and humans as a nice metaphor for bigotry, showing robots acting more humane than humans even in the worse times.  The animation is brilliant as well, with a seamless mix of CGI background and hand drawn cells.   Overall, one of the best animated movies in years and a true tribute to Tezuka's classic graphic novel.",4.5,5
Rotten Tomatoes, ,Metropolis 2001,"METROPOLIS is one of those anime films that literally sucks you right into the story. You immediately feel like you're a part of the world, connecting with the character's emotions, and brilliant screenplay from Katsuhiro Otomo (AKIRA).",5,5
Rotten Tomatoes, ,Metropolis 2001,"One of the most visually appealing animated films I have ever seen.

Disclaimer: I did not see Fritz Lang's original film or read the manga. So that may affect my review.

Metropolis is a compelling story that mirrors the biblical tale of the Tower of Babel. Man's ambition leads to its own (near) demise. The story also revolves around the class struggle between the middle (people) and working-class (robots). As the story progresses, the audience explores the city with the main characters. And like the city itself, the story is layered with lots of deeper meaning. The mood is full of awe and child-like throughout.

With all the storytelling, there are the visuals. And this film takes its time to show incredible shots of the city. There are details in every person, movement, and action. Not to mention the Art Deco heavy design of the buildings which hark back to 1920's vision of the future. This is a film that MUST be seen in full HD+ to be appreciated.

The music also takes a nice twist on other films of the time. The producers make some interesting -- and well appreciated -- choices by adding NOLA-style jazz. There's something unique with the choice of music that adds even more enjoyment into the film.

This is a film that can be studied many times over and still yield new findings. There's a story of love, of class struggle, the rise (and fall) of fascist idealism, among many others. And the visuals and music alone make this a perfect film to visit and revisit time and time again.

4.5 or 5/5. A well thought out film that leaves nothing to chance. A visual and cinematic masterpiece. Instant classic and must watch.",5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,peter m,Metropolis 2001,"In order to appreciate the beauty of this film you need to watch it on the big screen, its animation and breathtaking. I loved it the first time I saw it, but it is not a movie you can re-watch. While the animation is beautiful, the style of the animation jars. This is a serious movie about serious topics, but the characters are drawn in a manner similar to astro boy. This is not surprising considering the producer, but on a 2nd watching its something you begin the notice. The lack of dialog is also an issue for the 2nd watching, although this is not an issue when you watch this for the first time. I class this as a must watch, but you may find you cannot come back to it for a 2nd viewing without spoiling your first impressions of the movie.",3.5,5

Rotten Tomatoes, ,Snatch,"Brad Pitt really deserved his roles that he got cast in at around the time period this movie came out, with him still going off of the momentum of Fight Club from the year before. He performed very well in this movie and so did the other cast members. The movie’s script had great writing and I can even see Pulp Fiction’s influence reflected in this film as well, which is one of my all time favorite movies! The only small flaws are that there were a bit too many characters who played roles in many different parts of the plot, which made it feel a bit jumbled. Plus, the Russian Boris should’ve died instantly when he got hit that hard and fast by that car on the street. Nevertheless, it is still indeed a very enjoyable movie with a good twist at the end and dramatic tension throughout it!",4,5

Rotten Tomatoes,Blu B,Snatch,"All Time Classic. Pulp Fiction in the U.K. focused on the fallout of a rigged fighting match gone wrong. Masterfully done all around and Guy Ritchie's finest hour. Same could be said for Jason Statham here too. The characters are all quirky, memorable, funny, and really well acted. That says a lot for such a big cast. Brad Pitt is just hilarious here despite being barely able to understand a word he's saying. Music is really catchy and memorable. The editing and pacing is cut from the exact same cloth as Pulp Fiction with the out of order storytelling though done in a much more linear fashion. This is filled with twists and turns the entire way. It has got so much style to it's editing too and just knows right when to end to. Only minor complaints are the lighting is a bit dull and it can be very hard to keep up with what is going on at times. But it alternates between being lost and bringing you back so you know what's happening just to throw another turn at you while wrapping up all the main 3 trio arcs together by the end in a tight run time. Everyone should give this a shot once.",5,5

Rotten Tomatoes,Aleksandar D,Snatch,"Guy Ritchie's Snatch is a dazzling follow-up to Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, cranking up the style, wit, and chaos. The film spins a web of interlocking stories - illegal boxing, stolen diamonds, and a rogue’s gallery of unforgettable characters - all drenched in Ritchie’s signature Cockney swagger.

The ensemble cast is top-notch, with Brad Pitt’s unintelligible yet magnetic portrayal of Mickey the Pikey stealing the show. Meanwhile, Jason Statham anchors the whirlwind narrative with dry humour, and Benicio del Toro’s cool charm makes a brief but memorable mark.

Packed with sharp dialogue, frenetic pacing, and a killer soundtrack, Snatch is undeniably entertaining. However, its frenetic energy occasionally stumbles into excess, with so many twists and subplots that it risks losing its own thread. Still, the film’s sheer charisma and style make up for its narrative bloat.

A wildly enjoyable ride, if not quite as fresh as its predecessor.",3.5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Larry T,Snatch,"A masterpiece from Guy Ritchie. There’s a cult following for this picture. Among the ensemble’s many gems, Brad Pitt’s loopy, game performance is likely the top reason so many people love this film. If you don’t like stylish movies, don’t watch this.",5,5

Rotten Tomatoes,Laci N,1917 2019,"Sam Mendes’s film 1917 was meticulously crafted to immerse you in an emotional and visceral experience. The film focuses on 2 soldiers in World War 1 sent to deliver a message to a different platoon. The platoon they are being sent to are about to walk into a trap set by the German army. They must make it to the platoon before the morning, or else 1600 soldiers will be massacred by the Germans. The men fight to survive and experience loss, heartbreak, fear, and anger. By the end of the film, the viewer is given a sense of unfairness as the reality of war is presented in it.  

The director's choice to make the movie one continuous shot made you feel what was at stake, their lives. The film made you feel like it was never ending in the sense that the soldiers were constantly under attack. The choice of effects and setting create an incredible amount of stomach-turning suspense as the men continue their journey. The choice of the camera being a continuous shot immerses you into the story line making it feel like you are with the soldiers on their mission. This creates a feeling of having more at risk as the men push through explosions, gun fire, attacks, and more.  

I feel there are more strengths than weaknesses in this film. The strengths of this film are that the filming does truly immerse you. The emotion of the characters can be felt through the viewer for a guttural experience. Another strength I believe the film has is using younger, lesser-known main actors. I feel this is a strength as the audience builds their own connection with the characters. With how young they are, a tone of innocence adds to the characters. A notable weakness of this film is that it feels like a game. The characters seem like they just need to reach checkpoints to survive. However, this weakness could also be seen as a strength as the stakes are higher considering that war is not really a game and there is no reset button.  

The film itself can fit into multiple different genres such as war, drama, thriller, action, and history. I think this film fits best into at least 2 genres, war, and action. The movie is very clearly about war and offers a high stakes plot with multiple fight and chase scenes. The soldiers are placed suddenly into the mission of delivering the message to a doomed battalion. There is no time to think or consider until they are sent out through “no man’s land.” This makes the film act immediately and begins with a sense of anxiety as there is no choice. There is gunfire, explosions, death, and many more unsettling events that make the viewer invested.  

The marketing of this film I believe was presented very well. There was a total of 3 posters and 3 trailers created. The first poster presented the four large transparent numbers, “1917” with a sunset and barbed wire at the bottom. The second poster included the same large transparent numbers with the 2 main characters running away frantically. The main tagline of the movie was posted in the bottom stating, “Time is the Enemy.” The final poster pictured the 2 soldiers crawling on the ground with an empty plane hurdling right for them. The trailers created for this movie I feel did a wonderful job at promoting without giving too much away. All the trailers tell the same storyline; 2 soldiers are picked to carry a message to a different platoon before morning or else they will be massacred. However, as the trailers were created a few extra intense scenes are included to hold the viewers' attention. In the final trailer created, the directors include callouts for the multiple awards the film was nominated for.  

There were many awards the film was nominated for including Academy Awards, Golden Globes Awards, BAFTA awards, and more. During the 2020 Academy Awards the film won Best Cinematography, Best Sound Mixing, Best Visual Effects, and was nominated for many other awards such as Best Picture, Best Music, Best Sound Editing, Best Director, and more. During the 2020 Golden Globes awards, the film won Best Picture, and Best Director, and was nominated for Best Original Score. During the 2020 BAFTA awards the film exceeded winning a total of 7 awards out of the 9 the film was nominated for. In my opinion this comes as no surprise as the film was a truly immersive experience that not only educated the viewer about the true nature of war but also had a way of putting the viewer in their shoes.  

In conclusion, I would rate this movie a 4.5 out of 5 stars. I believe the cinematography of the film, along with its storyline creates a suspenseful and emotional experience that plunges the viewer into the high-stakes, intense encounter of war. The young actors provide the sense of innocence lost at the cost of war as they are exposed to the harsh reality of life-or-death. In my opinion there are very few weaknesses that this film has and countless strengths that make this film a marvelous feat.",4.5,5

Sin duda tiene secuencias preciosas, buen diseño de sonido y muy buena fotografía (lo más destacable). Seguir a Will me parece un recurso muy acertado, junto al recurso técnico más evidente, generando una mezcla bien establecida.

Rotten Tomatoes,Robert H,1917 2019,"1917 is a cinematic masterpiece that will leave you breathless. The film's unique approach, presented as a single continuous shot, pays off in a big way, creating an immersive experience that drops you right into the trenches of World War I.

The story follows two young British soldiers, Schofield and Blake, as they embark on a perilous mission to deliver a message that could save thousands of lives. With its gripping narrative, outstanding performances, and stunning visuals, 1917 is an absolute must-see.

One of the standout aspects of the film is its technical prowess. The cinematography, led by the incredible Roger Deakins, is simply breathtaking. The way the camera glides through the trenches, capturing the chaos and carnage of war, is a testament to the innovative filmmaking on display.

1917 is more than just a technical achievement; it's also a powerful exploration of the human cost of war. The film's themes of camaraderie, sacrifice, and the psychological toll of combat are deeply moving and thought-provoking.",5,5

We were glued to the screen, George Mackay and Dean-Charles Chapman were great castings for the leads. I also really enjoyed Andrew Scott's performance, though he doesn't get much screen time, his character has a nihilistic charm.

This makes him a perfect counter to Kim Basinger's Lynn Brackens who ended up winning a Best Supporting Actress Oscar for this film as the classic femme fatale character but one who just seems to be a victim of her circumstances as she works for a man who makes the sex workers get plastic surgery in order to look like movie stars, something that's truly dark the more you think about it and Kevin Spacey as Jack Vincennes gives us a man who has becomes so enamored with the veneer of his image that internally he's lost his soul in the process as becoming a celebrity has overtaken being a great detective. This story has so many twists and turns that only add to the mystery and make it better as the film progresses and despite how much you can see the huge twist coming, it's still a pretty shocking revelation and by the end it's one of those mystery films that will make for a great rewatch on many occasions.",5,5

Rotten Tomatoes,Jeremy S,La Confidential,"I walked into watching L.A. Confidential with high expectations. It sat at the top of the list of a top 300 movies of all time provided by both Tomatometer approved critics and Rotten Tomatoes users with a rating of 99%!

The film is well paced by Director Curtis Hanson, bringing us into the story surrounding L.A. in the 50's from the lens of the police we find ourselves following. 

Curtis does a good job of bringing us to become familiar with the various characters. We learn their personalities and intentions well through the acting + cinematography. Their intentions become vectors through which we will solve the central murder case through. Each male character has high centrality to the story, so we constantly learn more as we progress through the film.

Tensions rise in this film and are maintained throughout, with everything culminating at a point before we can receive the resolution.

For me this movie left something to be desired in terms of story. We get some depth in some main characters, but a lot of the other key central figures have little depth; particularly the villains. Why do they do the things they do? We find out little, they just do it because they are - which is not satisfying, perhaps it is not relevant to the story. Some of the violence borders on gratuitous, which may be intentional given the genre and story-line. 

Overall a good film, but for me it will not get the place of #1 film on my list!",3,5

Rotten Tomatoes,Christian L,Bicycle Thieves,Such a simple story that is incredibly moving. Heart breaking.,5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Diego M,Bicycle Thieves,"Bicycle Thieves (or Ladri di biciclette), directed by Vittorio De Sica, is a stark portrayal of post-war Italy’s hardships. The story follows Antonio Ricci, a man who, after securing a job that requires a bicycle, is forced to rely on his wife’s sacrifice of selling their bedsheets to buy one. When his bike is stolen on the job, Antonio and his young son, Bruno, desperately search for it, knowing that without it, Antonio will lose his livelihood. The film builds on Antonio’s escalating desperation, culminating in a moment where he steals a bicycle himself, witnessed by Bruno, leading to a profound emotional crisis.

The film's static camerawork enhances the realism of the story, focusing on the characters' emotional journeys rather than flashy techniques. Notable is a scene where Bruno witnesses his father’s crime. The camera movement, paired with the actor’s portrayal, draws the audience into Bruno’s confusion and sorrow, creating a deep sense of empathy. As a key example of Italian neorealism, the film depicts the harsh reality of poverty, with a focus on social issues such as hunger and unemployment.

The performances of the non-professional actors, including Lamberto Maggiorani as Antonio and Enzo Staiola as Bruno, are raw and authentic. Their powerful portrayal of the Ricci family’s plight draws viewers into their world. De Sica skillfully builds tension early on with a “fake-out” involving the bike, tricking the audience into thinking it will be stolen before it actually is, which heightens the emotional impact of the theft.

As Antonio’s desperation grows, he becomes so consumed by finding the bike that he neglects his son, Bruno. Through Bruno’s eyes, the film highlights the brutal realities of poverty and how far a person will go to survive, even if it means compromising their morals. Bicycle Thieves ultimately conveys the idea that in extreme desperation, survival often trumps morality, leaving the audience with a lingering sense of despair and the harsh truth of social inequality.",5,5

Rotten Tomatoes,Jens B,Bicycle Thieves,"🚲 Rome after World War II: A father, unemployed for two years, finally gets a job putting up posters, but he absolutely needs a bicycle for it. After pawning the family's good bed linens, he manages to reclaim his own bike, only to have it stolen on the very first day of work. What follows is an emotional rollercoaster, with shifts between hope and resignation. The brilliance of Vittorio De Sica's classic of Italian Neorealism lies in the universal and timeless nature of the themes it touches upon. Anyone who has ever struggled with financial worries, been dependent on a job or something else, can easily relate to Antonio's situation. Moreover, the fact that Bruno is probably one of the best child characters in film history, as well as the film's ending, makes BICYCLE THIEVES both profoundly simple and deeply moving. It is rightly considered a classic.

🔮📿 Both sequences with the fortune teller are fantastic. The first is a textbook example of suspense, while the second offers a graceful insight into the mother's emotional world, who otherwise only appears significantly at the beginning of the film.

🫣 (And can someone please keep an eye on Bruno? He's nearly run over multiple times, keeps falling down, and gets lured by shady old men.)",4.5,5

Rotten Tomatoes,Matthew B,Bicycle Thieves,"In one often-mentioned scene in Bicycle Thieves, the hard-pressed labourer Antonio Ricci (Lamberto Maggiorani) is putting up posters as part of what will prove to be a short-lived job that he vainly hopes will take his family out of poverty, and put food on their table. The poster he is putting up shows a picture of Rita Hayworth.

In one way, this can be seen as the contrast between the world of the glamorous film star and that of struggling Italian families living in post-war Italy. On another level, we could see this as the contrast between two different styles of moviemaking.

Rita Hayworth's movies belonged to a more idealised vision of the world. She starred in musicals, those films that celebrate wealth and glamour, and offer fairy tale endings. Even the more cynical of her movies are not realistic.

Vittorio de Sica was one of the pioneers of a different kind of film-making. His early works were made in the style of neo-realism. Bicycle Thieves was not the first Italian neorealist film. It was not even de Sica's first work in this style. He had already made Shoeshine at this point. Roberto Rossellini may be said to be the movement's originator with his wartime movie, Rome, Open City.

Nonetheless Bicycle Thieves is generally regarded as the best early work in this style, and it regularly appears in lists of the greatest movies ever made, rising and falling in poll position depending on current critical tastes. The film inspired many later directors, including Ken Loach, Satyajit Ray and Isao Takahata.

What exactly is neorealism? It is possible that the style developed in part due to accidental circumstances. Rossellini and de Sica were forced to make their early films on a low budget, and this involved making as good a movie as they could with the resources available, giving a rough-edged and raw look to them.

For Bicycle Thieves, de Sica could not obtain financial backing from a studio, so he raised the money to make the film by asking his friends for help. A rainstorm was provided with the help of the local fire department. Without access to a studio, de Sica filmed on location, using the streets of Rome as his backdrop

The extras in the film were street vendors. All the actors in the film are non-professional and untrained. Maggiorani was an ordinary factory worker, and a man who would struggle to find work after making Bicycle Thieves.

We should not form a misleading impression that Bicycle Thieves was purely an amateur production however. As de Sica's carefully composed scenes show, he was a professional film-maker. The circumstances surrounding the film's production may have been accidental, but de Sica fully subscribed to the philosophy of the neorealist movie.

De Sica wanted to show the lives of ordinary Italians without resorting to melodramatic, sentimental or far-fetched plots. His films had a social conscience. He wanted the viewer to care about the poverty and struggle of post-war Italians, and to share their suffering. He made films intended to make his audience feel angry.

The poor are shut out from this world of wealth. Ricci tries to give his wife Maria (Lianella Carell) a glimpse through the window of his new workplace, but an employee pulls down a shutter before she can see it. When Ricci decides to have a little father-son time by taking Bruno for a pizza, the hungry man and boy watch a rich family eating spaghetti. They also have a young boy, who gazes superciliously at Bruno. ""You would need a million a month to be able to eat like them,"" Ricci comments enviously.

Aside from the church, there is another ineffectual supernatural aid –a fortune teller who takes money from the family whilst offering vague advice: ""You will either find it immediately or not at all"". Ricci is perfectly aware of that, and wanted something more specific. Now he owes more money, and is no wiser. It is apt he should consult a dishonest fortune teller when he is being cheated by Fortune.

De Sica denies us an easy resolution. He does not want to reassure the audience, or allow us to feel too comfortable. He wants us to feel outraged on behalf of the Riccis and every other Italian family in their plight.

Rotten Tomatoes,Alexsander F,Bicycle Thieves,"O filme é lindo, é de uma simplicidade...",5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Matteo M,Bicycle Thieves,"02/25/2019: Alfonso Cuaron has just received his second Oscar for best director for Roma, a semi-autobiograpichal drama that tells the story of a live-in indigenous housekeeper of a middle-upper family (when he was just a kid) who lives in the ""Colonia Roma"", neighborood of Mexico City. The movie is shot near Cuaron's house when he was a kid during the 70's. Thus my first thought has gone to this movie, Bicycle Thieves, because it's Roma ancestor (70 years before) and it represents the apex in the neo-realism genre, the one which Cuaron's movie belongs. So I decided to watch it again to appreciate De Sica's masterpiece as director; this movie indeed isn't just a story about the harshness of life in the aftermath of WWII (the film has been shot in 1948), it's a manifesto of its time through the neo-realism lenses: a genre which doesn't express a style vice, in fact it's the way that goes more near to the objectivity of the narrator/director, by telling a story without never take a privileged point of view or take sides of anyone. Also, it's the most efficient way to show despair, inequality and poverty, like Cuaron did in Roma. The director take on screen just facts: nothing else. De Sica did it starting from Cesare Zavattini's screenplay, based on Bartolini's 1946 novel. 1948, Rome's suburbs: Antonio Ricci (Lamberto Maggiorani) is an unemployed, married with Maria (Lianella Carrell); they have a son, Bruno (Enzo Staiola), who works, despite he's only a child, in a petrol station. One day he receives a job offer for pasting advertising bills from the center for unemployment; he's thinking to refuse it because the job requires a bicycle, which he has given to the pawn shop because he needed the money to eat. Maria decides instead to sell their bed-sheets in order to buy the bicycle again, but, at his first day at work, a young guy (Vittorio Antonucci), steals it. Thus he will start a hopeless research of his bicycle with Bruno between Rome and its neighborood. De Sica revolutioned the way of making movies like Balzac and Flaubert did it with literature, putting on a screen real life, without filters or borders. The protagonist indeed is never judged, nor when he is the victim nor when he is the criminal. In addition, the camera, follows Antonio in every moment, minute after minute, hour after hour, without never turning its eyes off him, like a little fly that stays hidden in the sunlight, always in the middle of the action, and becomes an extension of Antonio. It's a 1,40 hour long effective tragedy, where starvation and despair are the real protagonists, where a bicycle, which is now used almost only for hobby, becomes a life-saving object. There's no hope, no positive ending: this movie had to be real, not beatiful. Absolute, absolute must-see.",5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,TWMax65,Bicycle Thieves,"The one thing that bothered me about the film was that I didn't feel like it wrapped itself up too well with an ending that should've included more angles from the rest of the movie with other characters (the old man, the wife, his friends, etc.). It only involved his son (with whom which a lot was explored well) and along with that, it was a powerful movie to watch with many parallels and solid significance. I really felt empathetic and cared for the main character and wished that I could travel back in time and into the movie to give him my own bike since his intentions were good throughout much of the movie, if not for all of it! Not my favorite Italian movie but still quality for the time!",3.5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,keith w,Bicycle Thieves,"What a pity one can't give a film 6 stars! A simple tale of how a bicycle can make the difference between eating or starvation. The grinding poverty of post WW2 Italy is presented starkly. This is not the tourist Rome of La Dolce Vita but the working-class Rome of anonymous housing estates and crowded buses. Yet the film is beautiful in the ordinary. These were non-professional actors, but the father and son were utterly convincing. The opening and closing shots show the theme of the individual and the crowd. Antonio is just one person in the mass of poverty, yet his story is remarkably individual. Despite the overt downbeat nature of the ending, I think the film ends on a subtly positive note via the relationship between the father and the son. The actor who played the part of the son Bruno was exceptional. The music is beautiful too.",5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,isla s,Bicycle Thieves,"This is quite an endearing watch, with charming main characters and an intriguing plot.

I enjoyed this film and would recommend it to others.",4,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Christopher B,Bicycle Thieves,"""Bicycle Thieves"" was one of the most widely acclaimed masterworks of Italian neorealist dramas, when at the time many critics believed the movement had passed. The film is composed of a simple, albeit powerfully emotional, story of a man who after selling off all the families bed sheets, gets his bicycling back from the local pawn shop. The bicycle is essential, as Italy at the time is impoverished and jobs are scarce as everyone tries to scrape out a mediocre existence. Everything is starting to look up as Antonio, our protagonist, secures his bicycle and is hired on to put up posters and bulletins around town. The first day on the job however ends in disaster as Antonio's bicycle is stolen and the rest of the film revolves around the attempted recovery of the bicycle. All the characters throughout the entirety of the film, no matter how brief their screen time is, has a story in their eyes and on their face. It's this sense of realism and everyday circumstances that add such a deep understanding of humanity and the human soul and make for a beautiful and thought provoking masterpiece! This is cinema in its truest and most pure and that is perfect!",5,5

The film is expertly shot, and has a patience in telling the tale that is very rare in any modern movie. The child Bruno is so earnest in his support of his papa. I hate to see the father grow so frustrated and upset that he lashes out at the undeserving family trying to help him. There is a reconciliation of sorts, but it is insufficient in my eyes.

Rotten Tomatoes, ,Bicycle Thieves,"A neo-realist movie destined to show us how harsh life is without any sort of filter. The acting is great and one can feel the protagonist's despair as he tries to recover his stollen bike. The story gets an additional layer when we get to know the thief and his life. A man with an equal poor life, surrounded by perhaps equal amount of  hardship.  It is interesting to see how people stick around the thief, showing a clearly decadent common moral conduct. Stealing is justifiable among them and they are oblivious to the impact of that theft on that poor man's life. The toughness and roughness of the world, with no filter or interference: just like a documentary. Worth seeing, but perhaps not when you are in need of some fantasy.",4,5

The best performance was definitely Bruno Ganz (god rest his soul) which was one of the most difficult roles that he ever played in his entire career he was truly spectacular in this movie. I highly recommend this movie if you haven’t seen it. There are parts that are quite heartbreaking and several parts that are just so confronting to watch. It’s a perfect 10/10 for me.",5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Shay k,Downfall,"Incredible and thought-provoking film. This movie shows Hitler's final days living in the bunker under Berlin, mostly from the perspective of his young secretary. It is book-ended with real interviews from his secretary. The acting was outstanding and from what I can tell from my googling, it appears to be quite accurate in its depiction of the events leading up to Germany's surrender. There aren't a ton of gruesome depictions of battle scenes, but you definitely feel the horror. There are lots of shots of hospitals and bunkers full of injured people and the film highlights the role of Hitler youth, so you see small children running into battle. More than a war movie this felt like a horror film about a bunch of people trapped in a bunker together slowly going crazy. The cruelty displayed by some of the officers and Hitler was truly disturbing- this movie humanized the man but certainly doesn't shy away from showing what a hypocrite and a sociopath he was. 

Part of the hard part of this movie is reminding yourself that other than the children, none of these people are innocent. Even our main character Traudl. She seems to have repented a bit after the war and claims she did not know the extent of what was happening but this woman was still a Hitler fangirl which is hard to remember when watching the film. Even though she made her bed, you find yourself empathizing with her fear of what will happen to her (something Hitler would call you weak for)

My one piece of advice would be to google some of the members of Hitler's inner circle before watching. You get a lot more from the movie if you recognize some of the generals in the bunker and connect them to acts in the war. Great film I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it",5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Wyatt E,Downfall,"Truly one of the greatest war movies of all time. What surprised me the most was that it was a German made film, but it is better to learn from history then possibly repeat it. 
This movie is a true masterpiece of chaos and anarchy. Bruno Ganz playing Hitler was a great choice, honestly half the time he really looks like Hitler; He also plays him very well, with a booming voice when ranting and a deep quite voice when talking normaly, much like the real Hitler. What surprised me even more than the movie being German made, was the aspect of them humanizing Hitler making him seem more like a real person, instead of a pure evil ranting maniac. Because it's important to remember that anyone with a similar mind set and life could do the same, and that evil can sprout from anyone anywhere.  
Another part of the film I liked was when we see the fighting and soldiers in the streets, it doesn't shy away from the grim and gruseme realism of war, we see people dying in realistic ways, unlike other big war films that have epic stunts and dramatic deaths. In Downfall we see the true extent of war, and just how brutal it can be. 
Lasty one thing I really liked was how they portray Hitler and Eva's deaths. Most war movie that include their deaths will show them committing suicide, but in this movie we only hear it; Which I think is pretty clever because there are people out their who truly belive that Hitler escaped Berlin, or that Bormann had Hitler killed. This allows thw audience to draw their own conclusions if  they want to and also leaves much to the imagination.
Overall this was a great movie and I highly recommend it",5,5

I just don't understand this impulse to try to generate empathy for monsters. I imagine it goes along with the stubborn insistence on overcomplicating the matter of why people do horrifying things. I don't find the question hard to answer and it seems like some people just don't want to accept the simple truth that people in groups do awful things because they want to and/or because they want approval and because they think they will get away with it because everyone else is doing it too.

It's a brutal and harrowing journey into a world of cowardice where accountability and culpability are secondary to personal interests.  While at times giving a human face to those who personify evil, it offers no excuses for their actions.

Rotten Tomatoes,Max A,Dangal,"Dangal, more than simply a Bollywood film is a masterpiece of cinema. Various interesting choices are made in the film, particularly the story being narrated by Mahavir's nephew Omkar (played by Ritvik Sahore and Aparshakti Khurana) which gives the viewer the impression that Mahavir (Aamir Khan) is the main character of the film — SPOILER ALERT: he's not —. Another interesting choice was the framing of the story itself. Mahavir didn't want his daughters to succeed as wrestlers because that was their passion, and as a father he wanted to push them to reach their full potential, not at all. What he really wanted was to live his dream through their children — this is not a hot take by any means. The character literally says it himself — which honestly makes him a jerk.

Performance-wise Ritvik Sahore and Aparshakti Khurana were great as comedic relief characters. Fatima Sana Shaikh and Zaira Wasim — who played adult and child Geeta Phogat respectively — were also remarkable. But the most outstanding performance, hands down, was Aamir Khan's. It feels like he gives no less than 100% in every single scene. The score and original soundtrack are also beautifully done and capture the spirit of the film to perfection.

In other words, Dangal is an immersive and enjoyable experience from beginning to end worth watching and rewatching.",4.5,5

Rotten Tomatoes, ,Dangal,"it's an amazing film, which shows the progression and development of geeta phogat as she blossoms into a gold-winning medalist in the 2010 common wealth games. the movie shows mahavir singh-ji building geeta from the ground up, and reflects how hard, dedicated work will eventually pay off. back in the 90's, boys would be the ones wrestling and for a woman to participate in a girls sport would be seen as humorous. however, geeta breaks the stereotype. this movie empowers young women to be able to fulfill their dreams, regardless of what gender society assigns to sports, work, etc. the movie sends the message to young girls that they can achieve what they want, as geeta did, even if others look down upon them. it shows that in a male dominating society, where pay rolls are higher for male counterparts and where males are seen as superior, women too can play an equal or higher role than what is expected of them. in short, this movie empowers young women to destroy the gender-based barriers built around them so they can achieve their goals in life. i would recommend this movie to those who are into wrestling, who haven't watched bollywood movies, or who are simply looking for a new film to watch. 5/5 stars, made me cry like 3 times.

Rotten Tomatoes,r 9,Dangal,"Too long, too predictable and too slow.

After the 161 minutes were over, I didn't hold anything majorly negative about 'Dangal' as it does improve as it goes on. However, the first chunk of this film is yawnful, with the story falling to initially inspire - just a guide on how to be a bad parent, in anything. The ending is also pretty cartoonish, with the broom cupboard stuff.

The cast performances are, in fairness, very good. Aamir Khan does great as Mahavir, while Fatima Sana Shaikh (and Zaira Wasim) are impressive as Geeta. Sanya Malhotra (and Suhani Bhatnagar) deserve praise also.

With that noted, It isn't really anything all that fresh for Bollywood sport biopics either. It follows similar beats to 2014's 'Mary Kom' and 2015's 'Brothers'... even 2011's 'Patiala House'.

For me, this 2016 production just feels so bloated and forced that it hampers the, admittedly noteworthy, hearty narrative. The leads are the only strong points to it in my opinion. It has been very highly received by others, so what do I know? Opinions and all that.",2.5,5

Robbie is excellent as well and has amazing chemistry with DiCaprio. When the two have tension it's electric. Everyone else is really good but DiCaprio just dominates this from start to finish. Just an incredible charismatic, sleazy, likeable, and sympathetic character. Music is really good but I wish it was a bit more catchy on it's own. Everythign else is excellent. Scorsese's trademark direction is all over this. Th only minor complaint is this probably didn't need to be 3 hours and could've shaved 20-30 minutes off and not lost a step. It's a tale of excess and at times that reflected in the plot. There are scenes where it can go on a bit too long with showing the excess drugs, sex, and excess. And it can get a little repetitive. But Scorsese is so damn good as a director, the execution is amazing, Jordan is such a fasinating character and so is this world of Frat Culture and Goodfellas. The world building here is first rate. This film follows a very simliar structure to Goodfellas & Casino so if you've seen those you basically have seen this flick. It does do a great job making the technical business jargon pretty easy to understand to it's credit. And weaves 80-90% of the time pretty effortlesly between Jordan's personal problems/relationships and the rise/fall of the firm. It's truly fasinating and like watching a real time car wreck you can't turn away from. Everyone should give this a try once.",5,5

It's certainly in the same category as his brilliant performances in Raging Bull and Goodfellas. His performance in The Godfather Part II is his absolute career best, in my humble opinion. Jodie Foster gave a stunning performance as a 12 year old playing a 12 year old who is living a life that no 12 year old should ever live. This film is one for the ages. A perfect masterpiece.

Someone of the characters are rightfully called out for their hypocrisy of proclaiming ""All men are created equal"" while simultaneously owning slaves, while others are unfortunately spared from consistent criticism & self-reflection (to be fair, John Adams and Alexander Hamilton might be doe of the only non-offenders here). Alexander Hamilton is really given his dues with all of his unappreciated contributions to the founding of America's government and history. There's so much rich history and character drama amongst all the characters as they transition from rebellious revolutionaries, to committed wartime leaders, to pioneers of America's newly founded democracy, to finally their bitter aftermath as they start to squabbles over power. The choreography is excellent and synced so well with the energetic music and densely clever lyrics.

Rotten Tomatoes,Cristine A,Hamilton 2020,"Hamilton: A Revolutionary Masterpiece That Redefines Theatrical Boundaries

Hamilton is a musical that tells the story of Alexander Hamilton, one of America’s Founding Fathers, using a mix of rap, hip-hop, R&B, and classic musical theater vibes. It follows Hamilton’s journey from being a broke immigrant to a major player in shaping the United States. The show debuted on Broadway in 2015 and later became a hit on Disney+ in 2020 with a filmed version of the live stage performance. Clocking in at about 2 hours and 40 minutes, the movie showcases an insanely talented cast and brings Hamilton’s story to life in a way that feels fresh and modern, even though it’s based on Ron Chernow’s biography. By blending historical events with contemporary music, it creates a story that’s not only fascinating but super engaging for both history buffs and casual viewers.
The acting and singing in Hamilton are off the charts. Lin-Manuel Miranda, who also wrote the show, plays Alexander Hamilton with so much energy and heart. He nails Hamilton’s ambition, flaws, and ultimate downfall, making you root for him even when he’s a little too much. His performances in songs like ""My Shot"" and ""The Room Where It Happens"" are packed with fire and intensity, perfectly capturing Hamilton’s unstoppable drive.
But Hamilton isn’t just about one person—it’s an ensemble powerhouse. Leslie Odom Jr., who plays Aaron Burr, is absolutely incredible. His take for Burr is subtle yet so chilling, and his performance of ""Wait For It"" is a total showstopper (My favorite). Odom’s smooth and soulful voice is the perfect balance to Miranda’s fast-paced raps, and he really brings out Burr’s frustration and envy in a way that feels so real. Phillipa Soo, as Eliza Hamilton, is equally unforgettable. Her voice is stunning, and songs like ""Helpless"" and ""Burn"" hit you right in the feels. She adds an emotional depth that makes the story even more powerful, showing how Hamilton’s ambition impacted his family just as much as the country. Of course the whole cast was so absolutely amazing but the amount of emotion I felt when hearing Leslie Odom Jr. was the same every single time. 
Directed by Thomas Kail, Hamilton is a masterclass in how to tell a story and keep it visually exciting. Kail does an amazing job of making sure the fast-paced, layered story never feels overwhelming or confusing. Even with the intricate lyrics and quick back-and-forth between characters, everything flows effortlessly. One of the coolest choices he made is keeping the stage constantly moving—whether it’s the actors, the props, or that iconic rotating floor. It creates this nonstop energy that matches Hamilton’s relentless drive for success and keeps you hooked from start to finish. Kail’s choice to mix modern music with the historical setting of the American Revolution was bold, but it worked really well. The contrast of rap and hip-hop with the 18th-century costumes and vibe might sound odd at first, but it’s genius. He and Lin-Manuel Miranda ground the story in universal themes—ambition, love, betrayal, and fighting for change—so it feels totally relatable even though it’s set hundreds of years ago. That mix of old and new makes the history feel alive and super relevant for today’s audience.
The design for Hamilton—from the costumes to the set to the music—perfectly captures the show’s bold, revolutionary vibe. David Korins’ set design is simple but so effective, using rotating turntables and clever lighting to keep things moving. The spinning stage adds a sense of momentum that mirrors both the constant push of history and the nonstop drive of the characters. It’s such a cool way to make the stage feel alive and fluid, instead of being stuck in one place.
Paul Tazewell’s costumes nail the balance between historical accuracy and modern flair. While the outfits stay true to the period, little touches like sneakers and fitted silhouettes make the characters feel fresh and relatable. It’s a smart way of tying the show’s mix of old and new together, reminding us that the founders’ challenges and dreams still resonate today. Then there’s the music—Lin-Manuel Miranda’s score is pure genius. It’s an amazing mash-up of hip-hop, R&B, pop, and classic Broadway styles, packed with fast-paced raps and emotional ballads. The lyrics are incredibly dense, giving you both historical details and deep feels all at once. The way the music flows with the story makes everything hit harder, and the live orchestra adds this extra layer of energy and emotion, especially in those big, dramatic moments.
Hamilton is a game-changer for musical theater, and it really feels like it’s ushered in a new era for the genre. While watching it on Disney+  I can’t fully replicate the buzz of seeing it live, the film version still delivers an incredible experience. It gives you a front-row seat to appreciate all the details—the performances, the staging, and the sheer scope of the production. The cast, led by Lin-Manuel Miranda, Leslie Odom Jr., and Phillipa Soo, is insanely talented, and their chemistry makes every moment hit harder. As a viewer, I was completely hooked by the energy and depth of the show. It’s amazing how it blends the historical with the modern in a way that feels fresh and meaningful. Miranda’s lyrics are pure genius! packed with wit and emotion and the cast brings them to life with so much heart and passion. Sure, the fast pace and dense lyrics might take a second to sink in, but the emotional impact and relevance of the story make it totally worth it. Whether you’re a history nerd or just dipping your toes into musical theater, Hamilton has something special for everyone. I've been blessed to of having the opportunity to see Hamilton multiple times live and it feels like first everytime I watch it.",5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Maddy C,Hamilton 2020,"This was the musical that made me love musical theatre.

I fell in love with this musical the moment I heard the album.
You get everything: romance, comedy, action, drama, crime and history.

 adore the movie on Disney +, as you get the best seat in the house —on stage and in audience angles, shots that follow the actors as the walk across the stage, close ups and more— but also as its a solidified 3 hour performance with the original cast and will go down in musical theatre history. 

Saying this, seeing it live would be magical. The ambience of a live theatre is unmatched. Seeing this musical, after seeing it with the original cast in the movie hundreds of times, with a different, talented cast would be something to look forward to.

Overall, this is a must-watch musical and tells a great story, in a detailed, thrilling way, no matter if you watch it on stage or on your tv at home.
Lin Manuel Miranda really knows how to touch an audience, love him and all his work!",5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Axel B,Hamilton 2020,"Hamilton is An American Musical, written and composed by Lin-Manuel Miranda, premiered on Broadway in 2015 at the Richard Rodgers Theatre. Running approximately 2 hours and 45 minutes and that includes a 15 minute intermission, the production offers a groundbreaking and energetic story of Alexander Hamilton, one of America’s Founding Fathers. By combining modern music genres such as hip-hop, R&B, and jazz with traditional show tunes, Miranda creates a fresh, dynamic perspective on American history. 
The musical follows Hamilton’s rise as a penniless immigrant to becoming George Washington’s right hand man during the Revolutionary War. It highlights his central role in founding the country’s financial system, his rivalry with Aaron Burr, and his struggles, including his relationships with his wife Eliza and Angelica Schuyler. The story builds up to Hamilton’s tragic death in a fight with Burr. While based on historical events, the production’s innovative staging, lighting, and modern musical style make the story relevant for a more modern audience. 
The cast of Hamilton delivers powerful and unforgettable performances, each actor embodying their character with precision and energy. Lin-Manuel Miranda, in his role as Alexander Hamilton, gives a passionate and determined performance. While Miranda may not have the strongest voice compared to others in the cast, his deep emotional connection to the role more than compensates for it. It is no surprise that since Miranda created Hamilton he is so passionate in his role as he captures Hamilton’s relentless ambition, particularly in songs like “My Shot” and “Hurricane,” where his fast paced delivery copies the character’s urgency to make his mark. One of my favorite moments in the film is the scene when performing “Hurricane” as it shows such a big part in history live directly to the audience. Leslie Odom Jr. gives, in my opinion, the show’s best performance as Aaron Burr. He adds real depth and complexity to the character. His smooth and controlled vocals in “Wait for It” and “The Room Where It Happens” perfectly show Burr’s frustrations and quiet ambition. Odom balances Burr’s charm with his growing resentment, which slowly leads to his tragic role in Hamilton’s downfall. His final scene in “The World Was Wide Enough” is both haunting and heartbreaking as Burr reflects on the consequences of his actions. Phillipa Soo’s performance as Eliza Hamilton is one of the highlights of the show as well. She brings warmth and real emotion to the role, showing Eliza’s quiet strength and grace in a way that really connects with the audience. Her performance of “Burn,” where Eliza reacts to Hamilton’s betrayal, is both heartbreaking and powerful. On the other hand Renee Elise Goldsberry does really well as Angelica Schuyler because she gives a bold and confident performance. In “Satisfied,” her fast paced delivery and strong emotions show Angelica’s loyalty to her sister and the hidden feelings she has for Hamilton. The supporting cast is just as impressive. Daveed Diggs shines in his two roles as Marquis de Lafayette and Thomas Jefferson. His great comedic timing and strong stage presence bring a lot of humor and energy to the show, especially during Jefferson’s almost swaggy entrance in “What’d I Miss?” Jonathan Groff, as King George III, steals the spotlight with his over the top, overdone performance. His comic relief in songs like “You’ll Be Back,” with exaggerated expressions and dry humor, is a perfect difference to the seriousness of the rest of the show.



Thomas Kail’s directing does a great job of balancing the show’s fast paced, complicated story with quieter, emotional moments. His staging helps make Lin-Manuel Miranda’s songs easier to follow, keeping the audience hooked and the story easy to understand. One of Kail’s best choices is the use of the revolving stage. From watching this film I could not keep my eye off it as it is both practical and symbolic. While performing “Satisfied,” the rotating stage allows Angelica to “rewind” time. In “The World Was Wide Enough,” the slow rotation of the stage adds tension to the fight between Hamilton and Burr, making the moment feel even more tragic. Going back to “Hurricane” Hamilton sings about his mother passing at 12, the music shifts from fast to a very slow pace, and at the same time the stage matches the tempo going from fast to slow pacing. Kail makes sure the supporting cast also plays a key role in telling the story. For example, in “Yorktown,” the ensemble choreography and movement bring the chaos and unity of the Revolutionary War to life, pulling the audience right into the action. Even in quieter scenes, Kail’s direction makes every movement feel determined, helping to keep the show’s pacing and rhythm smooth and engaging.
The design elements in Hamilton are simple but incredibly effective. It creates the perfect setting for the show’s fast paced story and time setting. The set design is minimal, featuring wooden scaffolding, ropes, and brick walls. This simple setup seems to reflect the idea of America as a work in progress while keeping the focus on the actors and their performances. Another important thing is the set is also flexible, allowing for smooth transitions between scenes, whether it’s a battlefield or a ballroom without taking away from the story or characters. The lighting design is a whole nother highlight of the production. The lighting sets the mood and brings out the emotions of each scene. This is a huge part of the show, especially for this type of music. For instance, in “Hurricane,” spotlights focus on Hamilton as he struggles with his choices while shifting shadows on the stage reflect his inner conflict. In contrast, warm golden tones during “The Schuyler Sisters” create a bright and hopeful feeling. The lighting adds meaning and depth to the story, helping to enhance the production without taking over the show. Costumes for this perfectly blend the time period accurately. The main characters seem to wear clothing inspired by the 18th century that highlights their character's personalities. For example, King George’s red and gold outfit emphasizes as mentioned before his over the top, comedic arrogance, while the Schuyler sister’s elegant gowns show a big contrast to the military uniforms worn by Hamilton and his allies. The ensemble is dressed in neutral tones, to not take away from the main characters throughout the show. 
Lin-Manuel Miranda mixes hip-hop, R&B, and traditional musical theater, creating a sound that feels both modern and timeless. The choreography is energetic and sharp and often works as a visual extension of the music. Like in “Yorktown,” for example, the ensemble’s perfectly timed movements capture the chaos of battle and the excitement of victory. Hamilton is a groundbreaking show that redefines musical theater. It combines historical storytelling with modern music, dance, and creative staging and lighting, making it feel both old and fresh. While the fast paced lyrics can be hard to follow, I don’t see a Hamilton film being better than this.",5,5

Rotten Tomatoes,Janice  G,Hamilton 2020,"Hamilton: A Tapestry of Narratives

“Hamilton”, a beautifully structured and well performed musical, written and starred in by Lin-Manuel Miranda has left a lasting impression on many. I had the pleasure of streaming “Hamilton” on Disney plus. “Hamilton” is also available on Apple TV, Prime Video, and YouTube. The musical ran for two hours and forty minutes, and in this time I was completely pulled into the incredible stories “Hamilton” presented. Just by the title of the musical, you might come to the conclusion that it focuses entirely on the narrative of Hamilton’s life. That’s where you’re wrong, Lin-Manuel Miranda allowed space for the stories of the people who were a part of Hamilton’s life to be told and it’s clearly visible during the duration of the musical. 

Though the musical starts off with the song “Alexander Hamilton” we get glimpses of the narratives of other characters to Hamilton’s life towards the end of the song. We hear the voices of the characters Mulligan, Lafayette, Laurens, Washington, Eliza, Angelica, Peggy/Maria, Burr all state their narrative and how they perceived Hamilton and their own actions and feelings toward him. Burr says, “And me? I’m the damn fool that shot him” while Eliza, Angelica, Peggy/Maria, “Me? I loved him”. As the musical progressed, I witnessed more narratives unfold. “Hamilton” allows the voices of many characters to be heard but two instances that stood out to me the most were when Angelica performed “Satisfied”. For those who have not yet watched Angelica’s performance, she reveals that she would have preferred Hamilton to be her lover instead of her sister’s. I personally enjoyed how it started off with Angelica sharing a toast to the bride and groom, then it slowly “rewinded” to the past of when Eliza, Hamilton, and herself met for the first time. She gets to express how she felt Hamilton and herself were so alike but the odds were stacked against them. It was chilling to not see the actress herself, it was as if I were truly watching Angelica and in the moment grasping all that she stored inside. Another performance that left a beautiful lasting impression was “Who Lives, Who Dies, Who Tells Your Story”. This song was filled with different Narratives, but a particular part of the song that gave me literal goosebumps was when Eliza shared that she put herself back into the narrative. She informs us what she continued to do as her life went on without Hamilton. She shares all the accomplishments she's achieved ranging from sharing the stories of the soldiers that fought by Hamilton’s side, sharing Hamilton’s story, to raising funds for the Washington monument, speaking out against slavery, to establishing the first private orphanage in New York City. The acting and singing was truly phenomenal and were great at revealing that the musical was created to quota more than just Hamilton’s narrative.

The direction of “Hamilton” by Thomas Kail really stands out in how it brings Lin-Manuel Miranda’s complex story to life. Thomas does a great job of making the narrative easy to follow, even though there’s many stories being told throughout the musical, the occurrence of historical events, and the emotional journeys of the characters. One of the things that make Thomas' direction especially effective is how he gives space for different characters’ perspectives to come through. For example, the way he stages the song “The Room Where It Happens” shows the tension between Hamilton’s drive for power and Burr’s more cautious approach. By using lighting and positioning, Thomas helps make their contrasting viewpoints clear. This focus on the different narratives, not just Hamilton's, helps the story feel more layered and complex, as we get to see the impact of the revolution from various angles–not just through Hamilton’s eyes. Thomas’ ability to juggle all these perspectives while keeping the story clear and engaging really enhanced the overall experience of the musical.

The production design of “Hamilton” was really impressive, especially witnessing the blend of modern and historical elements keeping the show fresh while still grounded in the past. The music choices played a big part in this, mixing hip-pop, R&B, and traditional musical theater to create something that felt both of its time and of todays. While Hamilton is obviously the central character, the way the music highlighted the perspectives of other characters was just as important. Take the songs “The Schuyler Sisters” or “Wait For It” –the styles of these numbers give us a deeper look into who these characters are beyond the big historical events. The production team, including director Thomas Kail, choreographer Andy Blankenbuehler, and the musical supervisor Alex Lacamoire, really brought their experience to the table. You can tell that they knew how to make the show feel energetic and alive, even on screen. The minimalist set design lets the characters’ stories take center stage, whether it’s Hamilton’s drive, Burr’s struggle with ambition, or Eliza’s quiet strength. It’s clear that “Hamilton” isn’t just about one person; it’s about the different perspectives of everyone involved in the revolution, and Thomas and his team did an astounding job of making sure each of these narratives gets told.

All in all, I’d definitely give “Hamilton” a thumbs up–it’s an amazing musical that’s not just entertaining but also surprisingly deep. The way the story was told through a mix of different music genres was really creative and it made the whole experience feel refreshing and exciting. Honestly, I did not want the musical to end. The pacing of the musical was quick, and while it kept things moving, I found myself wishing it were longer and allowing more time to explore the characters and the story way deeper. That being said, the musical was easy to follow, even with the fast lyrics and historical references. It manages to break down complex ideas in a way that’s accessible without oversimplifying. What I really loved about it was that it didn’t just focus on Hamilton’s story–it also gives voice to other characters like Eliza, Burr, and the ensemble, showing how their experiences fit into the bigger picture of the revolution. The musical did a great job of telling a much broader story, where everyone’s narrative plays an important role.",5,5

Hamilton by Lin-Manuel Miranda Shocks All with a 
Hip-Hop Remedy of History
	The musical Hamilton has caught many by surprise with a twist on history. Instead of the straight forward textbook theme, Lin-Manuel decided to put his own beat to the well known story of Alexander Hamilton. This movie is available exclusively on Disney Plus. I would highly recommend going onto the platform just to give this movie a watch. Although it is three hours long, it captures the whole story of Hamilton. It starts with his introduction to America and ends with his devastating death. Throughout the story, you can see his impact on building America. While watching you can see relationships grow between characters including Aaron Burr, Hamilton's wife Eliza, George Washington and many more. 
	Now looking further into the performances shown throughout the movie, let us start with the most impactful song of the musical. This song that I am about to introduce is sung by Phillipa Soo. Even though it is only three minutes and forty-five seconds it captures the essence of pain. The title of this mesmerizing piece is called “Burn”. The lyrics encourage the idea of pain and how hurt Eliza was when she had found out that Hamilton had cheated on her. This scene is definitely one to remember and the acting is crucial to the story. Throughout the entire movie there are many scenes that encourage you to keep watching until the very end. For my next song I chose to mention the song that starts off the film called “Alexander Hamilton”. Throughout this song you will see characters like Aaron Burr, Eliza, Hamilton, Thomas Jefferson, and others add to this masterpiece that captures the life of Alexander Hamilton. This song started the film strong and gave a brief idea of what was to come. To conclude, all the songs in this movie are very exciting and meaningful to the art of this piece, but these ones will definitely stand out. 
	Furthermore, let us look into the development of this movie written by Lin-Manuel that shocked all. I personally believe the piece was staged effectively and this is seen through the world finally knowing the full story behind the founding father, Alexander Hamilton. Without this musical, he would have just been another page in the history books. Time and time again I catch people speaking of this film or even singing the catchy tunes from it. In addition, Lin-Manuel made sure his narrative was set and clear for all to follow along with. A story that could have been very confusing was turned into something that people nowadays would be able to enjoy and follow. This can be proven through each song and how clear and effective the lyrics were. His lyrics were so well written to the point they are being repeated and heard everywhere. After watching you yourself will want to purchase the soundtrack as soon as possible. The music produced in this movie hit each genre, which I always thought was super smart and creative.  There is no doubt that Lin-Manuel made a clear impact with this film. To further explain, Lin-Manuel has been a writer for a long time and is very well known, he is in fact most known for Hamilton. His creative work has been seen by most if not all.
	Lastly, this movie was designed with much thought and time. It is visibly seen how much work was put into the music and display of this film, it has yet to go unnoticed. Lin-Manuel has also created other broadway musicals and worked on soundtracks for well known movies such as Moana and Encanto. If you have seen Moana and enjoyed the music, I would highly recommend Hamilton as your next watch. Lin-Manuel's talent is definitely noticed by all and is greatly appreciated. When pieces like this are put together it is usually hit or miss, but I personally believe all of his work deserves mention. 
	Overall, I think this movie is by far a five star rating and should be seen by all if you ever have the chance. Although it is long, it never gets boring and the music keeps you singing along. The plot has a timeline so it is not scattered and quite simple to follow. I definitely think if you have not watched it that you should reconsider and give it a chance. I hope you get to experience the shock factor of this hip-hop remedy of history.",5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Bob A,Hamilton 2020,"I was so wanting to watch and enjoy this musical, but unfortunately it was  clearly overrated. None of the songs were memorable in any way. The story was bland. Now, the voices were enjoyable. But none of the lyrics resonated. A waste of time.",0.5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Ksenia B,Hamilton 2020,"This version of Lin-Manuel Miranda's revolutionary musical ""Hamilton"" filmed from the Richard Rogers Theater in New York is absolute must-see. It tells us story of Alexander Hamilton, who is Founding Father of the United States.

Personally for me, the cast is perfect and extremely talented, every character showed their passion and determination in actions. They shone brighter than the stars on that stage. You believe their emotions because actors played really convincing.

Quality of filming is brilliant, it flawless shows us all the energy and dynamic of the live show on our screens.

Choreography could tell us story without words, but together with the music the effect on the viewer is multiplied a million times. This combination of hip-hop, jazz, R&B, and show tunes will have you on the edge of your seat throughout every minute.  Each dance and movement feel fully integrated into the storytelling.

If this genre isn’t your cup of tea I still advise you to give “Hamilton” a chance at least to get acquainted with the cultural and historical aspects that are shown there. For people who adore musicals, it`s absolutely worthwhile masterpiece, and I'd be very surprised if you haven't watched it yet.",5,5

The performances are excellent and genuine, and quite a lot of laughs if you allow yourself to just enjoy it instead of looking for the next thing to be critical of.   It’s a simplified version of serious subject matter, but done respectfully and in a way that makes it heart warming and feel good-not cheap.   The combo of these two completely opposite characters makes for a lot of funny moments, thought provoking moments, and moments that depict widely different worlds colliding.  I could watch several times through.",5,5

Rotten Tomatoes,Robert J,Green Book,"overall I enjoyed this film although it had some weak points, such as the depth of some of the characters like dr shirley.

The story was pretty decent with it also being interesting that its based on real events. the main weakness of this film was that it was very slow in parts with almost nothing going on, and another weakness is that rarely explained anything that was going on such as what places they were going and any imformation about side characters, while this is did increase my confusion it also increased the imersion to the point that forget you are watching a film and not just a perspective of the events that happened. 

in conclusion it was nice to see a movie touch on political topics without becoming dull, prepretentious or belittling. I wouldn't watch it again but may recommend for others to watch",3.5,5

Rotten Tomatoes,Jonas B,For A Few Dollars More,"///////SPOILERS AHEAD///////

////////READ AFTER WATCHING///////:




The way that each segment, main character, and main shot has a sound, and they all come together in the final duel, an ultimate climax, (the best diagetic to non-diagetic transition of all time) that ends up revealing itself to be a completely different movie than we anticipated? The fact that everyone would have loved the movie without the plot of Mortimer having a different reason than we thought, lends itself to an exponentially crazier final reveal, as tears stream down Mortimer's face when he gets the opportunity to avenge his sister that he's been dreaming about for so long. And then you watch it a second time, and there's moments you're not even supposed to know the meaning of, as you have no inclination of the final plot twist. Such as in the first 30 minutes, when El Indio's Bounty Poster is put up, Mortimer and Manco both clock it., but Manco's gaze tilts up to the bounty, and Mortimer's tilts down to the ""Dead or Alive."" He did that just for those watching a second time! Absolute killer of a movie, the best western ever made, better than TGTBATU, and Lee Van Cleef, and again Maria Volonte's best performances of their career. Also the only climactic gunfight Lee Van Cleef ever won, in the history of cinema. But it stands out so high above the rest, that you forget you're watching Sabata. You forget you're watching ""The Best of the Bad."" You're watching the best western hero the world has ever produced, Colonel. Douglas Mortimer. 5/5 Stars, perfection in movie form.",5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,matthias s,For A Few Dollars More,"""For A Few Dollars More"" might be a classic for many, but as someone who isn't particularly fond of westerns, I found myself on the fence. The movie undoubtedly boasts an amazing soundtrack that sets the perfect tone for its gritty era. The sweeping landscapes and detailed backgrounds also contribute to the immersive atmosphere. However, the story left me wanting more. It felt a bit dull and, at times, hard to follow. I struggled to connect with the characters on a deeper level.

While I'm glad I finally experienced this film, I doubt I'll be revisiting it. The runtime was quite lengthy, making it a commitment that didn't entirely pay off for me. Nonetheless, I can appreciate why "" For A Few Dollars More"" is beloved by fans of the genre. It's a testament to the craftsmanship of classic western cinema, even if it didn't quite win me over.",2.5,5

The way it stays so true to most Reality TV shows is amazing, how Truman advertises products without knowing it, and how everybody keeps on going on about how their city is the greatest in the world.

Marilyn Monroe adds a sizzling touch to the film as the ultimate femme fatale, with undeniable chemistry with the leading men. Ahead of its time, the movie fearlessly tackles themes of gender and sexuality in a comedic guise, challenging societal norms. Billy Wilder's direction weaves a fast-paced, witty narrative with sharp dialogue and unforgettable one-liners.

Rotten Tomatoes,jaylie h,1198124-Shutter Island,"Shivers down the Spine: a Review of Martin Scorsese’s Shutter Island



If you have ever felt the desire to question your own sanity…watch Martin Scorsese’s Shutter Island. Based on Dennis Lehane’s Shutter Island and starring none other than Leonardo DiCaprio as Edward ""Teddy"" Daniels, this alluring 2010s neo-noir psychological thriller demands to be seen. 
Taking place in the locked down psychiatric ward of Shutter island, U.S Marshal Teddy Daniels and his new partner, Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo) are called upon to explore a peculiar case of a missing patient. Weighed down by his own tragic past, Daniels knows there’s more going on than what meets the eye.
While Dicaprio's performance is a huge contributor to the gritty ominosity of Shutter Island, it is Scorsese’s utilization of brilliant film techniques that portray his vision exactly as intended. His creative camera angles and unique shots make for a persuasive storytelling method. Tracking shots are used to fabricate a linear path of carnage during scenes of concentration camps while rotating shots down stairwells propels viewers into madness. Additionally, the impact the editing choices have on the film is astronomical. Shots with long durations of screen time make for tense staredowns. Reversed cigarette smoke is cause for lack of control in a never ending loop. The colour grading in Teddy’s dreams saturates the screen with technicolor dread. The looming classical music drives chills into viewers' spines. However, what truly captures the attention of audiences, is Scorsese’s deliberate mise en scene. Moody lighting cast chilling shadows across characters' faces portraying robust feelings of distress in a picturesque manner. Stunningly tragic shots of blood splatter paint the perfect finish on scenes of gore ridden soldiers. Atmospheres of hurricanes paired with the ever falling reminders of Teddy’s past elicits an unmatched feeling of chaos. Martin Scorsese is an auteur on all fronts. 
The neo-noir style was a phenomenal style choice to capture the discomfort of the inability to trust one's own mental faculties. Similar to David Fincher’s The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2011) and Christopher Nolan’s Memento (2000) the modern take on 1940’s and 50’s American film noir evokes a gruesome cataclysm 

The nail biting script of this stand-alone film carries audiences through a flux of emotions on all ends of the spectrum. Matched with brilliant pacing, there is not a single moment of boredom. The cliffhanger will not only have you hanging on for dear life, but  questioning whether the cliff is actually a cliff or simply a delirium. 

For those mystery fans who love exploring the darkest depths of the mind and cinephilic lovers of poritat-esque tragedies I would absolutely recommend this film. Shutter Island is a psychological cinematic masterpiece. 
A mentally unhinged patient, seemingly vanished into thin air and a tangled web of secretive psychologists, Daniels is ensnared in a whirlwind of deception. With heavy tones of guilt, loss and insanity, Shutter Island illustrates a haunting narrative, sure to have viewers asking themselves “what the hell just happened?”",5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Blu B,1198124-Shutter Island,All Time Classic. On a fundamental level it's excellent. There are clues all around rewatching it that would go unnoticed to most people just like Psycho or The Sixth Sense which I'm sure this takes some inspiration from. The twist is excellent. I will say if your someone whose seen a ton of thrillers and loves the genre than you probably have a good idea where this is going before halfway in some shape or form but it's so well directed it really doesn't matter. The pacing really stands out too. For over a 2 hours it really doesn't feel like it and flys through. The editing is masterful also weaving between reality and imagination. Scorese's direction is first rate as always too and the setting is very memorable. DiCaprio is the standout amongst an all star cast who do an excellent job. Everyone should give this a try once.,5,5

Rotten Tomatoes,Kevin P,1198124-Shutter Island,"An intense psychological thriller with a fascinating unwinding mystery of the secluded psychiatric treatment island that the detective must unfold, but soon finds out much more horror than he is prepared for. There are some brilliant twists and turns that make you reanalyze the entire movie with a whole new perspective. Although I almost wish the move ended slightly earlier so it could be more vague and up to audience interpretation. But to be fair, they really commit to their final decision on the subject at hand. The performances are great all across the board, including Leonardo DiCaprio, Ben Kingsley, and Mark Ruffalo. The setting is great with the eerie mysterious island and its imposing psychiatric hospital and the forbidden lighthouse. The dark lighting and the cinematography is superb and gives the film a great spooky atmosphere. The twist reveals might leave some disappointed, but I personally enjoyed it for the most part and found this to be a very engaging psychological thriller from Martin Scorsese.",4,5
Rotten Tomatoes, ,1198124-Shutter Island,"I really enjoy the cinematography in this film and the premise as well.

Rotten Tomatoes,Mike H,The Kid 2019,I gave it one star because of the powerhouse actors in it.  But the fact is the lead actors father paid for this show to happen just to get his “kid” in a leading role. You should earn your way into a lead not be paid into it.  Therefore why this show should not be watched. Watch grass grow and let this fad into the depths of cinema history of what not to do.,1,5

Rotten Tomatoes,christopher c. m,The Kid 2019,"They end up held up with Billy The Kid who is holding out against Pat Garrett.  Ignoring two major facts that Garrett was a federal marshal not a sheriff, ergo able to cross state lines.  And the mounting evidence that Billy the Kid really lived to a ripe old age.  That Sara thinks they'd hang for killing their father stepfather.  Which they wouldn't, even in the old west self defense was a good defense.  Maybe it's Sara's fault being stupid and not a thing this movie would say will happen.  But that ignorance  is puts the rest of the plot in motion.  Lastly, this is why I hate most modern westerns.

Rotten Tomatoes, ,The Kid 2019,"What a huge letdown of a movie. I'm a huge fan of several of the actors in the film, but man what a disappointment. For a movie titled ""The Kid"", you would think it would be guns a blazing. But the kid barely had 1 gun fight. They portrayed him as not so tough and got schooled and killed with no effort. The writing on this movie seemed rushed and the budget was weak, especially given the actors who casted this film. Even the acting was subpar. Just 1 big huge horrible mess of a production to say the least. I could go on and on. I mean Young Guns was far better and that movie was decades ago and was hoping to see that relentless gunslinging, bust out of a chest dropped out a 2 story window on fire, pop open guns a blazing gun fighting type of movie. But.... Nope! It was a slow drama and I've felt far more action in reading a book than this so called movie. Well one things for sure.... They won't make him famous.....",0.5,5

Rotten Tomatoes,Darren D,The Father 2021,"""The Father"" extremely well made & tragic drama facing one's mental decline while suffering from the disease dementia.
Director, Florian Zeller throws you in the shoes of Anthony, as his confusion of memories are tough to break away from. Occasionally using actors to swap roles, the repeating of dialogue & the use of different locations keeping a familiar look in design to keep you trapped in Anthony's confusion of reality around him, it adds a certain emotional uncomfortableness to the storytelling.
Anthony Hopkins & Olivia Colman both give great heartfelt performances that deserve the praise, especially Hopkins as his performance left me emotionally beaten.",4,5
Rotten Tomatoes,James A,The Father 2021,"Ugh. Depressing. Both of my late parents had some memory problems, and I recognize the film's value for those with loved ones suffering from dementia. But the movie played unfair games with the viewer. For it to truly work as a visualization of what it might be like to suffer with Alzheimer's, it should have presented us only events that the Anthony Hopkins character experienced. But it didn't it included scenes with other characters interacting with each other without Anthony Hopkins' character present, which made the film a liar (it wasn't showing us The Father's point-of-view if it showed events that he didn't even see). But ultimately I didn't care. I just found the movie tedious. Sure Anthony was great. He's always great. He'd be great reading a recipe aloud.

Rotten Tomatoes,Ishara L,1000626-All About Eve,"I wish I had not read any synopsis. They unfortunately give away the gist of the main relationship. It rendered me confused because Anne Baxter's Eve was so brilliantly innocent at the start. I kept wondering whatever could be wrong about her. For the first half of the movie, I kept thinking that it was Margo herself projecting her own insecurities towards the younger, more employable actress. Because, if it weren't for her friends in the theater keeping her employed, Margo would have more trouble finding roles.

But then, slowly cracks begint to appear in Eve's story. And yet, the way it is presented to the audience, I kept not seeing it. Only saw that talented persona she had created herself. Eve is quick with her answers, steering the conversation so that the result will ever be in her favor. Only when she has to drop the mask, to show how vicious she can be to reach her goals, do we know what she has been hiding.

Wonderful! Indredible dialogue, witty and biting, combined with excellent acting. (Especially Bette Davis' look of contempt is so mesemerizing to look at.). An excellent look at the woes of the life in theater and how far smart manipulation can get you.",4.5,5

The dialogue moves a mile a minute and every bit of it is designed to move the plot forward and tell us more about these characters.

The only thing that met (even exceeded) my expectations was Bette Davis' amazing performance. Not only does her character feel endlessly authentic, she also balances immaturity with unbeatable charisma so you never falter in your support of her character. The other characters and actors were all a bit dull by comparison, though the script is partially to blame, since they're all somewhat under-developed.",3.5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Matthew B,1000626-All About Eve,"All About Eve is set in the world of theatre, but it is obvious that this is merely a metaphor, and that the film is really another cynical look at Hollywood. Indeed we do not see any stage scenes worth talking about it in the movie.

The movie follows the rise and rise of Eve Harrington (Anne Baxter), a new actress who cynically seeks to replace the leading female actress, Margo Channing (Bette Davis). The story has various narrators, but it is primarily through the jaded narrative provided by catty theatre critic, Addison DeWitt (George Sanders), an amusing but selfish man. 

At the heart of it lies Margo Channing. She may be confrontational, abrasive and rude when she wants to be, but she remains a sympathetic character. She has enough self-awareness to regret her behaviour later, and to apologise. 

At bottom Margo's insecurity is about age. The ageism of the acting industry is another important theme in All About Eve. We caught a glimpse of this in the allusion to the ‘freshness' of Eve's performance as Margo's understudy. She is fresh because she is new, and Margo's career has reached its peak because she is 40 years old.

Still she at least has the sense and self-knowledge to know when to bow out gracefully. She understands (as Eve still does not) that show-biz and fame are a hollow business.

If you would like to read more of my views on the movie (with spoilers), I wrote about it on my blog: https://themoviescreenscene.wordpress.com/2019/02/17/all-about-eve-1950/",5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Red  T,1000626-All About Eve,"It's Not Bad but I honestly was a bit confused as to why this is so raved about. My main problem is with the editing and pacing especially. Whenever there is a key plot point the film never shows it and just cuts to the aftermath. Than it usually is followed up with like clockwork some pretty witty dialogue but it isn't directly related to the matter at hand so it feels like it meanders and can be pretentious and a bit dry at times because the music isn't bad but isn't used that much. The acting is the best part and is solid overall Anne Baxter and Davis are the best things giving solid performances and a decent supporting cast. The Critic DeWitt though I didn't like him especially in the opening 3 minute narration where he is VERY dry and boring with his tone and stays that way throughout the film. The cinematography is decent but again it would be nice to actually see a lot of these key things actually seen instead of suggested indirectly. I do wish there was more scenes of confrontation between Baxter and Davis as their really isn't much at all. Davis when she is intense is the best parts and are really good scenes. However, this isn't like Rebecca where it creates atmosphere and leaves it up to the mind instead it comes across as empty and its a miracle I can still follow it. Surprisingly despite getting top billing, Davis isn't the main thing in this which is fine though. But the lack of key scenes missing, dry tone and scenes involving DeWitt lead to just passable pacing. The ending is interesting and does make you think about achieving fame and repeating cycles but the question is is it worth it sitting through 2 hours to get to it. If your a fan of any actors in this or the director than I would say Yes otherwise it may not be. It was interesting but needed better pacing above all else.",3.5,5

Rotten Tomatoes, ,Jurassic Park,"The movie is great and the special effects still hold  up today. The technique of combining animatronics and CGI makes the Dinos look real. Unlike most modern movies who over use CGI as a crutch, the original Jurassic park uses it to enhance the affects and it makes me feel that I can actual touch these dinosaurs like they are actually there. The movie starts as a basic Dino movie to a horror in 10 minutes. While yes I knew the kids and most of the main cast were going to survive I was praying that they make it out of the prehistoric hell. The genius mind of Steve Spielberg is able to bring the movie from a fantasy, to a honor, to a Fantasy, to a horror is just remarkable. It doesn’t feel like a there is a messed up tone in the movie. The animatronics are so detailed making them look like there paleo accurate designs of the 1990s. The second act of grant trying to get the kids back to the main lobby and the second archaeologist trying to bring the power back on makes you invested in every side story in the movie. None of the characters feel like dead weight (something I can’t say about the others) and you enjoy them in the movie. The only criticism I have of Steve Spielberg masterpiece is the ending. The older kid some how knowing how to bring the power back on while Samual A Jackson couldn’t is kinda an ass pull. While I think the theme they where trying to achieve is (especially in the 90s when computers started to become more of a main piece of the household) is that the young generation knows how to better operate newer devices and technology than the older one. Rexy (the main tyrannosaur Rex in the movie) just comes out of no where to kill the Raptors is just another ass pull. Speaking of the Raptors, I see them as the main threat of the movie. As the T Rex is the devil of the island the raptors are the demons of it.",4.5,5

The only thing that annoyed me was the lack of dialogue in the first 30 minutes where it was more story telling behind the camera and less face to face speech.

Rotten Tomatoes,David M,1067987-Casino,"I don't know why it took me quote so long to get around to watching this, but in the end it was pretty much as I anticipated it might be. All of Scorsese's trademark brilliance is on display, but too much of it feels like a return to the well of gangster crime dramas once too often (even if for me The Irishman is a better film). The arc of Sharon Stone's character feels a little queasy and too much like a version of a hysterical woman trope. There is too much narration, and at times the collection of needle drops on the soundtrack gets in the way. Though it's undoubtedly kinetic and gripping, it never feels surprising, and it doesn't quite achieve the greater depth of his major films. It's not a bad film, of course; but we do know that given the heights that Scorsese can and has hot so often, it just feels like a little bit of a let-down, despite all that there is to appreciate and enjoy.",4,5

Rotten Tomatoes,Julian Rex M,Sixth Sense,"Logic-skips and unfittingly abrupt plot-twist aside, The Sixth Sense holds up as a strong and unexpectedly moving entry into the horror-thriller genre for M.

Some kind of spiritual familiarity we lost or forgot about along the way. Some kind of familiarity we all know is true in our hearts!",5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,FINEZZER F,Sixth Sense,"M. Night Shyamalan's ""The Sixth Sense"" is, at its core, a cinematic paradox. It is a film that simultaneously transcends and succumbs to the limitations of its genre, a work of art that, despite its eventual narrative predictability, manages to enshrine itself in the annals of modern horror. While the modern astute viewer may readily discern the central ""reveal"" before the climactic moment, the true genius of the picture resides not in its narrative sleight-of-hand, but rather in the meticulous architectonics of its suspense, the resonant performances, and the hauntingly elegiac exploration of grief, guilt, and the ethereal boundaries of human perception.

To dismiss ""The Sixth Sense"" as merely a well-executed genre piece would be a profound disservice. It is, in its essence, a meditation on the psychological ramifications of trauma and the desperate human need for connection, even with the intangible. Dr. Malcolm Crowe, expertly portrayed by Bruce Willis with a restrained gravitas that belies the character's internal turmoil, is a man adrift in a sea of unresolved emotional baggage. His professional success – a testament to his empathetic understanding of the human psyche – is tragically juxtaposed against his personal isolation. The narrative expertly establishes Crowe's vulnerability from the outset, highlighting his inability to fully grasp the insidious nature of his own fractured reality. This vulnerability allows the audience to become complicit in the film's gradual unveiling of truth, mirroring the character's own harrowing journey.

The film's visual language, masterfully orchestrated by Shyamalan, is crucial to its success. The dark color palette, the deliberate use of shadows, and the unsettling stillness of the mise-en-scène create an atmosphere of palpable unease. The camera, often employing low-angle shots and lingering close-ups, subtly reinforces the sense of claustrophobia and isolation that pervades both the physical and emotional landscapes of the characters. These visual cues, combined with James Newton Howard's haunting score, function as a subliminal symphony of dread, gradually escalating the tension with each passing scene. This deliberate construction of atmosphere, characteristic of classic psychological thrillers, is a masterclass in cinematic tension-building, a testament to Shyamalan's profound understanding of the power of suggestion.

The character of Cole Sear, the young boy burdened with the ability to ""see dead people,"" played with astonishing maturity by Haley Joel Osment, serves as the emotional fulcrum of the narrative. Osment's performance is nothing short of revelatory; his portrayal of Cole is a nuanced blend of fear, resilience, and profound loneliness. He embodies the burden of his spectral communion, conveying a sense of tragic isolation that resonates even after the credits have roled. Cole is not merely a vessel for supernatural phenomena; he is a representation of the unspoken traumas that haunt the living, a conduit through which the film explores the complexities of grief and the desperate need for closure. His scenes with the revered Toni Collette are particularly compelling, demonstrating a deep understanding of the actor-director symbiosis.

The film's employment of traditional psychological thriller tropes is not merely derivative; rather, it represents a skillful reappropriation of established conventions. Shyamalan understands that familiarity breeds anticipation, and he deftly manipulates the audience's expectations, using the familiar elements of the genre – the jump scares, the unsettling sound design, the ambiguous character motivations – to heighten the sense of unease and anticipation. The iconic imagery, like the ghostly apparitions and the chilling pronouncements of the dead, transcends the realm of simple shock value, contributing to the film's overarching exploration of fear, vulnerability, and the fragility of the human mind.

Furthermore, the film’s narrative structure, employing the red herring with expert precision, deliberately misdirects the viewer, allowing the core premise to be disguised as it unfolds. While the observant viewer might anticipate the resolution before the final act, the journey itself, not the destination, is where the film truly triumphs. The gradual accretion of evidence, the subtle clues embedded within the lack of dialogue and visual cues, compels the audience to participate actively in the unravelling of the mystery. This active engagement enhances the film's impact, allowing viewers to become more emotionally invested in the characters and the narrative arc.

In conclusion, ""The Sixth Sense"" is a triumph of cinematic storytelling, a skillfully crafted exploration of the human life, and the lingering echoes of the unseen. While its pivotal plot twist may be somewhat predictable, its artistic achievements lie in its masterful suspense, its compelling performances, and its profound thematic resonance. It is a film that lingers in the memory, not just for its scares, but for its hauntingly beautiful portrayal of human vulnerability, and its exploration of the enduring, yet ultimately comforting, power of connection. It is, for all its spectral inhabitants, a deeply human story, which warrants, in my considered opinion, the score I have assigned: 91%. A near flawless masterpiece.",4.5,5

Rotten Tomatoes,Kevin P,Sixth Sense,"It does a terrific job at wearing down your guard and creeping up on you with its scares. Bruce Willis and Haley Joel Osmond have terrific chemistry together and really carry the movie with their brilliant performances. The makeup effects of the dead people and the way they are introduced are so haunting. The cinematography and symbolic use of the color red was really clever. The pacing and reveal of the titular sixth sense was done expertly well. The VHS scene with the child was so haunting, and all without a single jump-scare. There’s quite a bit of dramatic depth to this movie too. Granted, there are some occasional weird/unintentionally funny moments and pieces of dialogue. But it’s still a solid paranormal thriller that was a blast to watch, despite me getting the famous twist spoiled years ago before I finally sat down and watched the entire movie. But the fact that I liked it even after knowing the twist is only a testament to how well the twist actually worked (unlike most of Shyamalan’s other movies later down the road).",4,5

Rotten Tomatoes,Birithivy Y,Sixth Sense,"The Sixth Sense - 10/10. M. Night Shyamalan's breakthrough film catapulted him in to the big leagues of directing, and also brought a new voice into the mystery/psychological thriller genre. Revolving the story around a young boy who sees dead people, the film could have easily been a horror film or one that is a psychological drama. But more or less, this is an excellent drama first, diving into the mentality of the young boy (played amazingly by Haley Joel Osment), his mother who struggles with raising him (a fantastic performance from Toni Collette), and the psychologist that helps the young boy (a revered and surprisingly subdued performance from Bruce Willis). Its a movie that has some scary scenes here and there, but the gist of the story is propelled by the excellent tone and atmosphere brought to life by M. Night and cinematographer Tak Fujimoto. Its a dark and dreary film, mixed in with this coldness that you rarely find in PG-13 horror films. Also, you can't talk about this film without referring to the plot twist and literal red herring's that happen through out the film. Its quite an amazing feat for a young director, to establish a film full of small details that the viewer must be keen on noticing while watching. It makes for a much more attuned viewer and creates a sense of purpose to each and every scene. An excellent thriller that sparked a wave of copy cat films and inspirations. But, the original will always be the best!",5,5

Rotten Tomatoes,Jay W,Ran,"""Ran"" is Kurosawa's version of Shakespeare's ""King Lear"". Now, Shakespeare wrote a lot of great plays, but not many would call ""King Lear"" his best play. Likewise, Kurosawa directed a lot of great films, but not many would call ""Ran"" his best movie.

The visuals are all on point. The cinematography, the colors, the sweeping landscapes and action scenes are all beautiful. Above all, Kurosawa can still artfully frame and block a shot.

The problem with the film comes from the characters. Every character is in some deranged state of mind. Everyone is crazy, insane, mad or some combination of the three.",3,5

Rotten Tomatoes,Nicolas D,Ran,"Ran is an absolute masterpiece when it comes to storytelling centered around revenge. This film flawlessly captures the essence of vengeance, weaving a gripping narrative that keeps you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. The characters are brilliantly portrayed, drawing you into their world of intrigue and payback. The plot is a finely crafted web of suspense and retribution, leaving no loose ends and providing a satisfying resolution. Every element, from the direction to the performances, is top-notch. Ran is a perfect example of how revenge can be a compelling and thought-provoking theme in cinema. It's a must-watch, and I'd give it five stars without hesitation.",5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Jon T,Ran,"I felt moved to add my two penny worth after watching a tv programme about the making of the film.

I am 68 now and have spent a lifetime watching movies; l would say without hesitation this is one of the best. The fact l remember so clearly the circumstances tells you that. I know it's all a matter of taste but l am truly baffled that some people don't like it.",5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Jerod S,Ran,Epic length and some great cinematography - but I'm not seeing the greatness in the acting or the fighting while giving it grace for being an 80s flick. The King Lear plot line is so on the nose that it doesn't hold anything exciting.,2.5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Yash B,Ran,"""Ran"" is somehow my first exposure to the classic story ""King Lear,"" so I went into the film not knowing how the story would play out. There is a lot of political scheming and some stellar battle sequences that make this an engaging watch when it comes to the story. However, this film shines with its use of visual artistry and color. Kurosawa didn't have the opportunity to make films in color for most of his career, but this film is a clear example that he utilized technology to the fullest. It often looks dazzling visually and even when the story slows down pace-wise, it always looks visually spellbinding. Overall, it is a film that has an epic and grand story that dazzles with its visual flair and should be watched by any fan of Akira Kurosawa.",3.5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,DanTheMan 2,Ran,"I've been long overdue a rewatch of Ran but it always feels like a discredit to Kurosawa when you watch any of his movies on a small screen. Taking Shakespeare's King Lear and crafting an accomplishment that's a feast of colour, motion and sound, all the stops were pulled out for this one. Overwhelming on a physical scale Ran plays to Kurosawa's obsession with loyalty and his love of expressionistic film techniques, playing with a beauty that suggests a kind of drunken, barbaric lyricism. The horrors of life transformed by art into magnificence. I once called Ran an unparalleled masterpiece, and I still stand by that to this day, but given its brethren include Yojimbo, Seven Samurai and Ikiru, it remains one hell of an achievement. Any fan of westerns, war movies, or period films, in general, owes themselves at least one viewing of Ran in their life.",5,5

Rotten Tomatoes,Max H,No Country For Old Men,"No Country for Old Men is often praised as a cinematic masterpiece, but in reality, it’s a sluggish, over-hyped mess that collapses under its own weight. The pacing is painfully slow, mistaking long silences and drawn-out scenes for depth, when they just stall the plot and test your patience. Major plot points are left dangling with little payoff—like the off-screen death of a main character—which feels lazy rather than bold. The supposed symbolism gets lost in a hollow narrative that offers more questions than answers, and the ending feels less like a conclusion and more like the filmmakers just got bored. As an adaptation, it strips the novel of its emotional grit and philosophical clarity, leaving behind a film that’s more style than substance.",0.5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Daniel C. M,No Country For Old Men,"The Coen's masterpiece about fate, injustice and adapting for the future plus letting go of the past, even if its for the worse. This is a special kind of film, one that actually never holds the viewer's hand and challenges you to use your intellect. Guaranteed to keep you on the edge of your seat not only because of the directors and their quirky but very welcomed artistic decisions (not including any kind of soundtrack until the very end is one of them), but also because it includes one of the greatest performances of this century to date: Javier Bardem as the ruthless and nightmare-inducing hitman Anton Chigurh.

I also respect the way Del Toro include heavy message about Spain Civil war. Even though he chose heavy topic, he express message easy to understand way, without being too explicit.

Rotten Tomatoes,Ishara L,Pans Labyrinth,"The best way to describe it is a dark fairy tale. Ofelia uses her imagination (or the magic innate in the world?) to deal with the atrocities that are happening around her. Even if it is never shown she witnesses it first-hand, she is around the violence there is no way she has no knowledge of it. So, she enters a world of her own, where she has to perform her own battles.

There, she is put in danger. But, she manages to survive every time. Is that an anology for the things she goes through mentally? That's she's always ready to depart in her head? Or die because of the things around her. She must be terrified. Terrified for herself, for her mother and for her brother.

It's really one of the greatest fey tales put on film. Magically dark with a moral tale underneath it. Ofelia's tale contrasts so well with that of her stepfather. Would you sacrifice all that around you to get what you want most in the world, to eventually never have it in the end? Or would you sacrifice yourself so someone else can live and be rewarded by what you deserve? An excellent moral tale.",4.5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Shawan S,Pans Labyrinth,"""Pan’s Labyrinth is like a beautifully twisted fairy tale that decided to take a detour through the realm of dark fantasy! Imagine if Alice stumbled into a Spanish Civil War instead of Wonderland—cue the magical creatures and a very grumpy Captain. With visuals that are more stunning than my last haircut and a story that’s as deep as my love for tacos, this film hits all the right notes! Plus, who knew a giant toad could be so fashionable? I laughed, I cried, and I definitely need a therapist after that ending. Four stars for making me want to simultaneously hide under my blanket and explore mysterious labyrinths!""",4,5

The practical effects and creature designs are amazing, as are the story and characters.

Eastwood literally learning to get back into the saddle while trying not to relapse in both the booze and the business of killing leads to an empathetic character, but one definitely morally bankrupt.

Rotten Tomatoes,Brad S. R,Treasure Of The Sierra Madre,First-rate filmmaking across the board.,5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Ishara L,Treasure Of The Sierra Madre,"As far as movie making techniques are concerned, this movie doesn't invent something new. Where it shines in though is it's story, dialogue and acting.

It's a great tale of morality; 3 guys set out to find gold and become rich. They do anything in their power to protect it when they find it, even amongst themselves. Greed is a vile thing and even the most thrustworthy of the two admits if he was younger, he might have been tempted by it.

Sometimes a challenge along the way becomes an asset, an enemy can become a friend and aid in the mission. The greatest danger always comes from within though. Humphrey Bogart is excellent as Dobbs, jovial when everything goes well, crule and suspicious when he's in a bad mood. Fear drives him more than actual malice though. It's also because of him that he influences the rest of the guys, make them just as suspicious. If a character like Dobbs wasn't there, the party would have made it with less anxiousness.

When in the end, all the efforts are futile, those that remain can't help but laugh about the fate of it. They tried and worked so hard for it only to have it blown away. What else can you do? But, along the journey for the one thing, they've found something else. Not the thing they were looking for that would make them rich, but something that will make them richer in life.",4.5,5

Rotten Tomatoes,Matthew B,Treasure Of The Sierra Madre,"John Huston made a number of movies in which flawed characters are pursuing a goal that will elude them. In The Treasure of the Sierra Madre however, the goal of the three anti-heroes is unambiguously and literally money. They are seeking gold.

Our heroes experience the problems of money from both sides. They begin by struggling with the difficulties of not having enough of it, and they end by falling apart after they acquire too much of it. Too much or too little, it requires strong character or good luck to avoid falling victim to its corrupting influence. Whether these three men will find a way to manage their newfound money or will fall apart as a result is what this film explores.

The story follows three poor gringos who are unable to find work in Mexico, and have to struggle to find a living. Fred C Dobbs (Humphrey Bogart) falls in with Bob Curtin (Tim Holt) while they look for work. As their money starts to go down, Dobbs and Curtin decide to join Howard (Walter Huston), a sprightly and enthusiastic old man who has been gold prospecting, and who has the urge to go again if he can find anyone to accompany him.

By now we have learned enough about the three men to receive some intimations of what is to come. All are tough men who are willing to bend and break the rules. Curtin is the most pliable member. He is decent in his way, but likely to fall in with what the other members say.

Howard seems like a garrulous and foolish old man as he dances on the spot where they finally find the elusive gold, but appearances belie him. Dobbs and Curtin worry about bringing an old man along, but the seasoned prospector is full of energy, and soon leaves them behind panting for breath. However Howard brings more than energy. He brings experience, and the wisdom that he has learned from that experience. His knowledge proves invaluable to the other men. 

That leaves Fred C Dobbs. We have seen enough to know that Dobbs is a roughneck, and his complacency about the dangers of gold prospecting does not bode well. He also takes a ruthless pleasure in killing the bandits who attack the train on which the men are travelling.

Bogart said of his role: ""Wait till you see me in my next picture. I play the worst shit you ever saw"". Indeed fears that Walter Huston's lively performance as Howard would upstage Humphrey Bogart were without merit. Bogart makes Fred C Dobbs into one of movie's most memorable bad apples, selfish and greedy yet still somehow pitiful.

However Dobbs is not without his redeeming features. When he and Curtin beat up the boss who swindled them, Dobbs takes only the pay that he is owed, rather than emptying the boss's wallet. He is also happy to use his lottery winnings to put up the money for the destitute Curtin to come on the expedition. To begin with, he has a sense of fairness.

Surprisingly The Treasure of the Sierra Madre was not a great success on its first release, but it has sold well since, and has come to be a much-loved classic. There is something compelling about this simple morality tale, and it is told with great humour and enthusiasm by John Huston.

The Treasure of the Sierra Madre is a 1948 American Western film written and directed by John Huston 🫏

I liked the first half of this movie, but then it started to drag and ended up being far too long…

Fred C. Dobbs and Bob Curtin, both down on their luck in Tampico, Mexico in 1925, meet up with a grizzled prospector named Howard and decide to join with him in search of gold in the wilds of central Mexico. Through enormous difficulties, they eventually succeed in finding gold, but bandits, the elements, and most especially greed threaten to turn their success into disaster.",3,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Steve K,Treasure Of The Sierra Madre,"It has all been said before but a must watch for me if just for Bogart's incredible performance as a man's descent into gold madness.
This is beautifully offset by Walter Houston's performance as a man in love with the Mexican people and a lifesaver in a stunning piece of cinematic story telling when he aids a family to try and save their son.
The end result still brings tears to my eyes.
The film is a quirky masterpiece of early cinema but timeless in its story telling.

Impeccable character study that considered flaws and polar opposites leading into growth and acceptance either to ascendance or a downfall while testing few morals, delivered through a sharp script and expressively by exceptionally committed performances. (A-)",4,5
Rotten Tomatoes, ,Treasure Of The Sierra Madre,"A film that is an adventurous western that also happens to be an extreme character analysis of how corrupt man can be is what The Treasure of the Sierra Madre is. This film have three characters that are all put into the position of greed. One is forever tainted, the second is mixed, while the third is pure of heart. The Treasure of the Sierra Madre is such a fantastic film. The musical score composed by Max Steiner is excellent and intense at times. The acting performances by Humphrey Bogart, Walter Huston, and Tim Holt are extremely incredible. The cinematography by Ted D. McCord was pretty nuanced especially the scene when Fred C. Dobbs (Humphrey Bogart) sleeps by the campfire as the fire rises symbolizes that he is forever corrupt. The Treasure of the Sierra Madre is overall a fantastic and artistic film that gives people so much to think about.",5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,yash b,Treasure Of The Sierra Madre,"""The Treasure of the Sierra Madre"" is a movie that stands the test of time because of its complex exploration of morality. I feel like the characters in this movie aren't necessarily good people, and it keeps their every move interesting. That being said, it also makes it hard to root for anyone. I think it is an interesting movie but I never felt like any of the characters really deserved to win, but also I think that is the point the movie is going for. I was also very impressed by the technical elements of this movie. For a movie made in the 40s, it still holds up well and the action and adventure feel completely believable with minimal dated effects or filmmaking style choices. Overall, it is a movie with strong themes and interesting characters, with an adventure that has some merits but isn't always completely engaging because I didn't feel as invested in it as I should have.",3.5,5
Rotten Tomatoes, ,Treasure Of The Sierra Madre,"A litany of prescient musings by the ""wiser"" old Howard, so oft repeated that you'd be amazed if Dobbs did not fulfill Howard's tedious prophesies.  A draggy, disjointed plot ... are we to believe an proto-environmentalist Howard could convince Dobbs to remedy the mountain's scars as they sat on a $105,000 treasure (that's over $1.6 million in 2022) ... and Dobbs would immediately morph from sullen pain-in-the-ass to happy, eager beaver?

And are we to suppose that Curtin, a totally broke bum, will pop up in Dallas to bring endless joy to a young widow who doesn't know him from Adam?  How about the nameless rich American in stereotypical white tropical suit who grub-staked Dobbs, just to make him go away?  Howard going off with the locals and leaving his share behind?  With Dobbs?  Laugh uproriously at a lost fortune?  Gimme a break!

This entire film succumbs to endless foreshadowing, cheesy fight scenes, child-level moralizing, and a disjointed, chaotic ""plot.""

We love Bogart.  Why so many love ""Sierra Madre"" relies on celebrity worship and fawning over a supposed ""golden age"" in cinema.

Look at any distinguished actors filmography, and you'll always find forgotten failures.  Bogart is no exception, no matter how much we wish he was.",1,5

Rotten Tomatoes, ,Treasure Of The Sierra Madre,"Trust is a commodity.  So this is about two broke and down-on-their-luck Americans (Humphrey Bogart, Tim Holt) in Mexico.  Money is tight, so they decide to go all in and gamble on an old prospector (Walter Huston) to find them some gold in the middle of nowhere.  As luck may have it, they find a lucrative spot.  However, when a fortune is on the line, nothing is simple.  I've always been aware of this movie's existence, but I had never taken the time before now.  All I knew about it is that many regard it as a classic, and there is that iconic line about badges.  I don't have all that much experience with the library of Humphrey Bogart other than Casablanca and The Maltese Falcon, so I figured that now was the time to rectify that.  Well, let me say that the consensus is absolutely correct.  Now perhaps it was just me not knowing what to expect, but the thing I enjoyed most about this is how this movie kept evolving.  It kept me on my toes, and I could never pinpoint how this story would unfold next.  This starts with two men who do not have any money, so when they finally get to a point where they may have a chance at having means, you can understand why they are grasping at it so tightly.  What I was not expecting this to morph into was the paranoia-fest that it becomes, and that is where this is just brilliant.  I mean really, it may not outdo it, but this rivals The Thing in how much suspicion is being passed around this group of three, and right at the center of it all is Bogart who is the shiftiest of the lot.  All three men can dish it as much as they can take it, and there isn't a weak performance in the bunch.  This could have easily fallen apart if there was, but because they all rise to the occasion, we got ourselves a film that will stand the test of time.  There aren't that many Westerns that take place in Mexico out there, and it's hard for me to imagine one that does it better than The Treasure of the Sierra Madre.  They never let you forget how treacherous and unforgiving the terrain is, not even for a minute.  Every character in this is always covered in sweat, sand, and grime, and that only adds to the atmosphere that is masterfully built.  This story is all about greed and mistrust, and everyone here nailed it.",5,5

Rotten Tomatoes,Stephen L,Prisoners 2013,"Dark, gripping and deeply unsettling, Prisoners is one of the most intense thrillers of the decade. Denis Villeneuve directs with slow-burn precision, delivering a story thick with dread and moral ambiguity. Hugh Jackman gives a career-best performance, matched by Jake Gyllenhaal’s tightly wound detective. Paul Dano, Maria Bello, Viola Davis and David Dastmalchian all leave lasting impressions. The film’s emotional weight and visual composition are brutal in the best way. Suspense done right.",4.5,5

The acting was great individually but it felt like they weren't on the same page. There were several plot holes as well as plot points that felt forced/were added just to move the story forward or  to give the movie a ""meaning"".

Rotten Tomatoes,Jess F,Prisoners 2013,"""Prisoners"" is rich in compelling narratives and stellar performances from the ensemble cast. This movie had me love and hate Hugh Jackman's character which was so complex to the point of making me question my moral standards because I found myself empathizing with his character. On the other hand, Jake Gyllenhaal did a marvelous job on playing the frustrated cop: complete with all the intensity of his eyes and his intuition. While Gyllenhaal had more screentime as the lead, Jackman's performance really stood out for me.

This film doesn't use jumpscares (often precluded by suspenseful music to build-up the tension and are often abused in this genre) in order to thrill the audience, but rather, moments of silence and stillness. Its calm and cold vibe stirs up the kind of anxiety it wants its audience to feel, and naturally, the audience would want to get rid of that uneasiness by knowing what's going on, thus, cleverly forcing them to watch the entire film which runs about 2 hrs and 33 mins.

The director, Denis Villeneuve, incorporates his ""less is more"" style of using soundtracks in this movie (just like what he did with Blade Runner 2049) to emphasize the scenes, especially with the ending (heavens know how much I liked that ending). It's not rocket suspense but the simplicity of it makes your mind wander to other possibilities which I think is often a good indication of a brilliant film since it's open for other interpetations.",5,5

Rotten Tomatoes,Omar G,Yojimbo,"Yojimbo (1961).

I like A Fistful of Dollars (1964) better, both based on Dashiell Hammett's Red Harvest. For example Sergio Leone improved the scene where the protagonist kills the first thugs. I also like Sanjuro (1962) better.

Toshiro Mifune Kuwabatake/Tsubaki Sanjuro one of the synonyms of cunning next to Philip Marlowe, The Man With no Name, Batman his weapon is cunning above all.

I liked how Mifune refused to be Obi Wan Kenobi, he have said ""I am Toshiro Mifune, why would I make that movie?"" 

I like the quote ""Kill one or a hundred you will only be hanged once."" Sanjuro's plan to make them exterminate each other and he profit it like balkanization.

The worst would be that crying child, hateful, loud and complaining, along with his father who is a bit of a man, a good-for-nothing idiot.

Rotten Tomatoes,Christopher S,Yojimbo,"The influence this has on westerns is plain. Immediately you see stories such as Shane in the plot. A solitary warrior, looking for the next place to stay, finds a town in turmoil, torn by two warring factions. The samurai, superior in combat to everyone else, plays the two sides against each other, recognizing that there are no good guys here in the factions. He manages to mostly get them to kill each other, but then he gets ambushed, tortured, and left for dead. Then the battle really begins. 

My only criticism is that it suffers from the sin that Game of Thrones committed-- building up a foe only to have them dispatched far too easily.",4,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Matthew B,Yojimbo,"For reasons unknown, some foreign language movies are widely known by their original titles, and not by an English translation. Yojimbo is the Japanese word for ‘Bodyguard'.

Perhaps since the titular character is employed to protect a gang rather than an individual, the translated title seemed too confusing. Indeed this bodyguard does not even live up to his name within the movie's definition of the word. A samurai is supposed to live up to his word and be loyal to his employer, but this samurai merrily betrays the trust that is bestowed upon him, and changes sides when it suits him.

Sanjuro (Toshiro Mifune) is not a typical samurai in many respects. A samurai should be well-kept, but Sanjuro's appearance is scruffy and unkempt, showing a carelessness towards his caste. He is a ronin (a masterless samurai) who lacks employment. He drifts from place to place with no purpose beyond finding work and food. His arrival in the nameless town is arbitrary. He throws a stick in the air, and sets off in the direction in which the stick points.

It is not only the town that is nameless, but our hero too. He shows no pride in his name or heritage. When he is asked what he is called, he looks outside at a mulberry field, and gives himself the name Kuwabatake Sanjuro, which translates as ""30-year-old mulberry field"", although that might not be his real age either.

The town in which he arrives is ideal for a hungry samurai, which means that it is a hellhole for ordinary citizens. The streets are empty, and a perpetual wind blows dust all around the town, creating an atmosphere of waste, desolation and chaos. The townsfolk are mostly to be found indoors peering through shutters, as the streets are not safe for honest people to walk through. Only criminals can walk fearlessly through the town.

As Sanjuro passes through the streets, he sees a dog scamper past carrying a human hand in its mouth. Indeed many of the characters in the film are no better than wild dogs, and the word is frequently used about them. The town is divided between two rival gangs, and they hire thugs to protect their interest. Many of their hired swords are on the run for a murder they committed, or have spent time in prison for a past offence.

ojimbo subverts the situation that the viewer often saw in the old westerns that influenced Kurosawa. Usually the hero is a hired gun who chooses to defend the good side in their fight against the bad side. Here there is no good side, only a choice of two bad sides, and it hardly matters which side Sanjuro chooses. His only interest is in picking the side that pays him the most.

This plot summary might suggest a depressingly nihilistic film, but Yojimbo is hardly that. The tone of the movie is set by its percussive and rhythmic music score that is both belligerent and jaunty. Kurosawa had intentions of showing the damaging effects of violence, hence the emphasis on dismemberment, but this is undermined by the cheerful cynicism of the plot and hero.

Our hero certainly seems like a ruthless figure who blithely manipulates both sides for his own ends. During the scene where he bows out of the street battle, he sits perched on high watching the cowardly mercenaries approaching and retreating without a blow being struck. The camera angles are carefully shot so that we constantly see Sanjuro towering over the other men as they pretend to fight, emphasising his superior position, while the other characters move like figures in a game of chess. Only Sanjuro is refusing to be a knight or a pawn. He is playing a game of his own in which he does not care how many chess pieces are removed from the board.

To view Sanjuro as amoral would be a profound misreading of his character. In fact, Sanjuro has loftier aims from the very beginning.  The disapproving tavern owner Gonji (Eijirō Tōno) tries to persuade Sanjuro to leave this blighted town. Sanjuro confides his ideas to the honest publican:

Listen, old man. I'll get paid for killing. And this town is full of men who deserve to die. Think about it. Seibei, Ushitora, the gamblers and drifters – with them gone, the town could have a fresh start.

In short, Sanjuro sees himself as a scourge who can cleanse the town by removing the criminal elements that are stifling the lives of honest people. While Sanjuro betrays and deceives those who deserve it, he is notably loyal and fair in his dealings with trustworthy men such as Gonji and the cooper (Atsushi Watanabe).

While Sanjuro is very much a human being – he is motivated by money, and he can be captured and beaten – there is also something transcendental about him. He is like an embodiment of higher justice, removing all that is corrupt and evil in the town. His powers as a samurai seem superhuman, and he can kill any number of adversaries without trouble.

For all its alien elements, Yojimbo is a movie that helped to set the tone for many films that followed. It offered a tougher and more cynical approach in which villainy was not glorified and heroism was tarnished.

Rotten Tomatoes,Isaac M,Yojimbo,"Yojimbo is one of the most important Japanese films in cinema history. It's a pure movie that looks better every time you watch it. I love Akira Kurosawa's direction, Toshiro Mifune's performance, unique story and creative landscape and production design. Overall, Yojimbo is one of the finest films I have watched.",5,5
Rotten Tomatoes,Christopher B,Yojimbo,"his actions.
The editing in the film is another critically important element. Kurosawa's editing techniques grew more skillful as his works progressed; adding to Yojimbo's message, not interrupting it. Keiko McDonald notes that, ""At the very beginning of Yojimbo Kurosawa establishes the temporal setting of the film by the use of the subtitle: 'The time was 1860...the emergence of middle-class merchants put an end to the power of the Tokugawa Shogunate...'"" (McDonald 188). The film, while being in black and white, and before CGI became the norm, is much more simplistic. With the lack of technology, directors and cinematographers had to have even more skill in order to realize their ambitions. Subtitles were often used as a way of establishing a setting, leaving no room for misrepresentation. It's in the film's best interest that the editing techniques advance the story while showcasing the varying groups and characters current situation as well as their interactions with one another. In the case of Yojimbo, if the viewer were to solely focus on one gang, or Sanjuro, and then transition over to another, the complexity of the situation and the realistic back and forth between the opposing elements would be completely lost.. Instead we are given many transitions between the two with each event or information being spread around to the other and it creates a more fluid and complex film.
The editing ensures a temporal and spatial continuity that advances the story while conserving the emotional buildup through the film and come to resent the warring sides and support Sanjuro and his quest to trick the two sides. This is essential as the flow of the film is dictated by the editing techniques used and the sequences order and arrangement in the running time of the film. If you were to view a different scene first instead of in its placement within the film we would disturb the director/editor's, in this case both were done by Kurosawa, intention and throw off the particular rhythm of the film's progression.
There are many aspects that are involved in making a film and while there are many different roles to fill in order to bring a motion picture together. It's the director who ensures the right people are in these roles. Over Kurosawa's career he developed great relationships and worked closely with a select few people on a regular basis. For this reason, many of his films and the works that were produced, including Yojimbo, have warranted praise as pieces of art. We have looked at a few elements that were paramount in bringing Kurosawa's vision to life in his film Yojimbo and what made him really stand out as a director and as a true artist. The film Yojimbo is simply Kurosawa's decades of film making and refining of his craft put into a motion picture with a complex and interesting plot and distinctly unique characters. The world they live in may be of a different time and place, even a whole other culture than ours, but it's our relatable feelings with the struggles of daily life that make us really feel for the under privileged and resent the power seeking corrupt. It's these basic elements that really pull in the film's audience and lend a layer of emotional correlation between the viewer and those in the film. Together, with the great cast and crew, a director is truly able to forge an admirable work of art.",5,5

While the story doesn't do a whole lot for me personally, I still felt engaged by the movie because of its style and dedication to creating this world. Overall, it is not necessarily the best of the Kurosawa films I have seen so far, but it is still one that showcases the legendary director's abilities behind a camera, at least from a technical perspective.",3.5,5
Rotten Tomatoes, ,Yojimbo,"Akira Kurosawa's 1961 epic samurai masterpiece Yojimbo, is a story about a samurai with no master who enters a small village in Japan run by two rival businessmen. The samurai takes the name Sanjuro and starts a gang war between the two rivals.

The film mounts with tension as each second passes by, and builds up to one of the most stressful final confrontations I have ever seen. The film's organic use of natural elements like wind, dust and rain make each scene stick in my mind. The cinematography and visuals are simply amazing and deserve much credit. I don't know how a village in 19th century Japan should look, but the film's production design immersed me and made me believe that's how it was.

Yojimbo somehow takes an anti-hero character and makes him into someone I cared about. The writing is also great and there are genuinely funny moments for which I laughed. The film contains some very valuable screenwriting and moral lessons. It shows social disorder and corruption which is very much relevant today. Even with all this, the film manages to remain gripping and entertaining if you are looking for just that.

In short Yojimbo is essential viewing for audiences looking for any type of film. If you are looking to watch a film for a weekend, you must check out Yojimbo, even if you haven't seen many black and white classics before. If you want to understand key principles of writing and direction, it is a must watch.",5,5

Rotten Tomatoes, ,Yojimbo,"Okay I don't care what anyone says, black and white films BANG. This opening scene is amazing!!! The score and Toshirō Mifune's head with mountains in the background as credits roll… what could be better??

Akira Kurosawa will go down in history as one of the best directors of all time. He's flawless in the realm of film and it's amazing to watch! The acting is phenomenal and it's proof of a good director who knows how to work with his actors. Toshirō is stellar and I love his facial expressions, a true actor, something hard to come by nowadays. No wonder Kurosawa always worked with him, he's simply spectacular.

There's something so special about old black and white Japanese films that get me so engaged. Even with Seven Samurai (3 1/2 hours) I was into it the whole time. The sound design in these kinds of films are great too, whether a character is walking or eating, if the weather is windy or rainy, every sound effect is perfect.

The story is at times hard to follow. Maybe it's because I know little to none about Japanese culture but I was still at times thinking to myself, ""why in the world is this happening?"" Or ""what does that mean?"" The plot itself is great, I just think I lost it a little somewhere in the middle. There's simply so much that happens I was always just a tad bit confused.

It's no Seven Samurai, but it's good. It's great even, however not perfect. I love the sound design, the cinematography, the shift in scenes, the acting, and the writing. ""Well what else is there Daniel, why isn't this 5 stars?"" The film drags—and not in a good way where I'm super excited to keep watching—in the way of ""wow, there's still 35 minutes left??"" It's close to perfect and I would definitely watch it again, but it's just too slow of a pace. Although the last 25ish minutes really make up for it. It's action packed and has you on the edge of your seat. (Yes I sound very indecisive, I know.)

Give Yojimbo a try! Akira Kurosawa does not miss and I can't wait to explore more of his filmography. If you like Seven Samurai, you'll definitely enjoy this. 9.5/10 from me!",4.5,5

And, of course, there is that fantastic motorcycle chase with Steve McQueen (that didn't really happen - McQueen insisted that he had to be able to showcase his motorcycle skills or he wouldn't do the film!). Other characters were composites, but the main part of the story is close to the real events, and they used a real survivor of the camp as a technical consultant. And Donald Pleasance was eminently qualified to be POW since he was one in real life! He did say in an interview that prisoners were not as rude to heavily armed guards as in the movie - I think I would be polite to a guy with a Schmeiser submachine gun too!

The truth behind the tale only adds to that sheer level of excitement while marvelling at the ingenuity and seemingly unbreakable spirit of imprisoned soldiers. For all its moments of terror and tragedy, is to delight in captivity in times of war as a wonderful game for boys, an endless Houdini challenge to slip through the enemy's fingers. Topped by its amazing all-star cast of loveable greats, the expert direction of John Sturges, eminently hummable Elmer Bernstein score, and rip-roaring stunts, The Great Escape is simply great escapism.",5,5

I could watch this movie with no breaks if I have enough time or didn't have to eat dinner. This movie was slow, but it didn't feel slow. But the reason I gave this four and a half stars instead of five stars is because I hated the ending. Because after the allies who escaped came out of the prison camp, they either got sent back to the camp, or they died. Even though that is what actually happened, and the allies distracted the Germans from the war, I still didn't like the ending. What a good movie. I give it 80%.",4,5

The movie is often considered an action movie classic, which is a bit surprising to me. Don't get me wrong, there are plenty of exciting moments, but this is a more dramatic film than I expected. It is very long but I think a lot of the time is necessary to set the stage and show the intricate elements of the escape portrayed in the film. Overall, I think it is a movie that is very well made, especially for its time, and has a lot of detailed storytelling that while slow-moving, is usually still pretty interesting until the inevitable escape sequence begins.",3.5,5

What's also impressive is how there is so many characters and while I don't remember there names I absolutely remember who they were and what they did and why it mattered. This never feels dry either with a very playful fun tone throughout, which is a bit deceiving as the last 30 minutes are very bittersweet. The setting was memorable and the scenes were very clever despite the prison being a very dry and bland location. The characters and the story brought it to life. The tunnel set was really cool though. Only minor complaints is I wish there was a bit more action or it would've built up suspense better by being a bit darker rather than fun and lighthearted throughout, or they could've trimmed the runtime a bit. As is though it's a great time and something everyone should see.",5,5
