    "    - BERT is a model that is trained using two steps\n",
    "        - Pretraining -> unsupervised learning to identify relationships between words in a huge corpus of text\n",
    "        - Fine-tuning -> supervised learning, conducted by attaching a network to the front of BERT and training it used examples + labels\n",
    "            - **Ex.** Feeding BERT movie review text (input) and making it predict a rating (output/label)\n",
    "                - We use the review's actual rating to measure how well BERT performed, and then use backpropagation + gradient descent to fine-tune bert\n",
    "    - BERT is pretrained using MLM (Mask language modelling), and NSP\n",
    "        - Masked lanugage modelling (MLM) -> Hide words from a text, and get BERT to predict the word from the surrounding context \n",
    "        - Nest sentence prediction (NSP) -> Present two sentences, and get BERT to correctly predicti if the second sentence follows the first sentence\n",
    "    - **NOTE:** MLM seems to provide decently high performance alone\n",
    "        - In the ablation study, removing NSP still had accuracy of SST-2 (sentiment analysis task, which is relevant to us)\n",

       "['Oh dear Shingeki no Kyojin, where do I even begin. If you\\'ve talked with your friends about anime, then the couple anime that everyone talks about are Naruto, Bleach, One Piece, Dragon Ball, and... Shingeki no Kyojin. What\\'s the difference between Shingeki and the rest? Shingeki only has 25 episodes so far yet it\\'s on par in popularity with the other super long, Americanized anime. Why is it popular? Well that\\'s simply because it\\'s stunningly amazing. Those people that call Shingeki no Kyojin \"overrated\" may not have the same taste as me, and that\\'s perfectly fine, but in my honest opinion, Shingeki no Kyojin isone of if not the greatest anime to be made. It\\'s not popular for no reason.\\n\\nThe story is one of the most captivating stories I\\'ve ever seen. 100 years prior to the start of the anime, humanity has been on the bridge of extinction due to the monstrous humanoid Titans that devour humans. Now, present day in the anime, the remaining small population of mankind lives confined within 3 \"heavenly\" walls that are so tall and sturdy that even the titans can\\'t break in. The most outward wall was named, Wall Maria, the middle wall was named Wall Rose, and the most outward wall named Wall Sina. Unfortunately for mankind, a colossal titan, one that is even bigger than the 50 meter heavenly walls, breaks Wall Maria, allowing the other titans to rampage the city, thus leading to another massacre of mankind. During this massacre, our main characters, Eren Yeager and Mikasa Ackerman watch in horror as a horrifying titan rips their mother\\'s head off, then gobbles her up whole. Vowing that he\\'d one day avenge mankind and exterminate all the titans, Eren Yeager trains to become a survey corp, brave heroic soldiers who go outside the walls, into the plains in order to fight the titans. But we soon find out, that Eren is much more special than he seems, not only is he a brave warrior, but he\\'s also something else that could be the key to humanity\\'s survival, but could also be humanity\\'s destruction. \\n\\nMy 3-word thoughts on the anime: Epic, Dynamic, Masterpiece. The suspense build-up was absolutely amazing, yet there was still room for improvement; that shows just how epic this anime can get. The anime not only includes epic fights, but lots of dialogue, and for those of you that hate dialogue, I feel sorry for you people whom only watch for action. The anime includes lots of other things as well: there\\'s lots of half-hearted, hilarious scenes, as well as sad, tragic scenes. The anime certainly has a good amount of gore, and will break your heart frequently (if you get attached to the characters). Many characters end up getting gobbled up mercilessly while trying to protect humanity in ways that are quite *shivers*. Have I teared up in the anime? As a matter of fact, I have. \\n\\nCharacters was another area (alongside every area) that was Shingeki\\'s strongpoint. There\\'s a diverse variety of characters that fight for humanity for all different reasons. There\\'s trust, friendship, along with betrayals, and pains. There\\'s comedy relief among many characters, especially Sasha \"Potato Girl\" Blouse. There are characters that people can definitely relate with, such as Armin Arlert, who wants to do the right thing and protect his friends, but can\\'t seem to do much because of fear. Fear is something that haunts us all, and prevents us from doing things in life. Another character that people can somewhat relate with is Annie Leonhardt, who fights alongside humanity, yet fights opposed to humanity. What does that mean? Watch the anime. Why is she doing this? Because of her past scars, \"scars have the strange power to remind us that our past is real\" (watch to find out more). There were too many characters to development fully, but certainly the main characters were developed to their max. Levi is certainly a fan-favorite character, because of the fact that he\\'s cool, overpowered, badass, kind-in-the-heart, smart, straight-to-the-point, and most of all, hilarious with all his neat-freakiness. The main character, Eren Yeager is strong-hearted, and \"special\", but he\\'s still not strong enough to defeat the titans. How he develops is one of the most interesting things, in this interesting-things-packed anime. \\n\\nThe art and music can be described in one word: WOW! The art drawings were absolutely stunning! From the characters/titans to the setting of the story to all the equipment used in battle. The characters all had a unique aspect to them. The settings of the anime were beautiful. The cities, and walls looked realistic, the plains that characters dreamed of seeing made me want to run outside to see for myself how beautiful nature really is, and how humans under appreciate the naturality of nature. The 3-D gear was something that really caught my eye, and will certainly catch other people\\'s eyes as well. A new form of action that\\'s never been seen before. The characters would literally fly from rooftop to rooftop slicing their swords at the titans at high-speeds that keep the viewers eyes locked onto the screen at all times. The soundtrack in the anime was epic as shit. The openings speak for themselves, they do the anime justice. The openings were epic and certainly set the mood of what was to come from the anime. \"They\\'re the prey, and we are the hunters!\" The rest of the soundtrack in the anime was okayasgduyasgda AMAZING. How can one describe how amazing those German OSTs were. They fit in perfectly with the epicness of the anime, and certianly added tons of suspense to the 3-D maneuver gear action. \\n\\nOf course, I may be over-thinking things, but the anime certainly included some themes while creating this masterpiece of an anime. The aspect of being confined in an area, doing the same daily routine every day. People seek to be free, and to seek adventure. Watch for this. Another theme that the anime incorporated was that of the cycle of life. Humans, we steal animals away from their families, we kill them, we eat them. What\\'s so different from us, and the titans? The feelings of not being at the top of the food chain... Anyways, if you haven\\'t already watched this anime and you\\'re reading this review, then you\\'ve clearly been living under a rock all this time, and I definitely encourage you to watch this show even if it isn\\'t your style of anime.',\n",
       " 'I started to follow the manga after watching the anime and quite frankly I don\\'t see where and how the plot of Shingeki no Kyojin can suck, which in my humble opinion is awsome. You can understand the anime very well even without having read the manga. However, SNK isn\\'t understood by many because it\\'s a psychological manga .. SNK isn\\'t just a succession of empty and meaningless clashes and, of uncontrolled violence, stereotyped heroes who fight the bad (like Bleach). Here are shown the darkest sides of the human psyche with great mastery: the desire to be the best but can\\'t do it, thedifference between men, their different modes of action (just think about the speech when Eren was discovered in which they show the reactions of the inhabitants of the inner walls Rose) and their motivations, some of the questionable actions that seems to be made in the right and instead the Justice of others that superficially seems foolish and petty (such as the choice of sending refugees to rebuild the wall Mary), freedom and the fact that they don\\'t understand that what others inculcate to us sometimes are nothing more than mental cages. We stop at the appearances only because it suits us ( the walls is a symbol of that). Omitting the main and masterfully developed theme of \"Homo omini lupus\".\\nIn this anime there are no heroes! There are not brave men, without fear, that kill all the wicked. Here there are people who are fighting against their own fear and that sometimes they make it and sometimes not. The enemies aren\\'t the giants !Although the anime does not say from where they come from and I won\\'t do spoilers, it\\'s repeated several times that the enemies are the human beings with their fear (who have surrendered to the giants without doing anything, ignoring and accepting to live like cattle) and the walls! But no one notices that because it would be too challenging to make two questions and wondering: \"Why the walls ? Shouldn\\'t they be their salvation?\" and get an answer.\\nThe fact that many people aren\\'t well characterized, and that physically are not very different from each other isn\\'t a coincidence .. Isayama is putting on the same level all human beings, he is saying that we are all like that guy who shoots himself alone after he surrendered to fear, that we are all as Vernam (who during the attack fled from Trost ), that there is some of us who is better than others, but that we all live under the same fears, and even if we react differently, we act according to substantially the same nature. It still tells us that we might be the protagonists of our life, choosing our destiny, but only if we are ready to go beyond the stereotypes and mindsets that others impose to us, only if only if we work with all our strength. Because living by what others tell us, from what they show us, isn\\'t to live, but survive!\\nAnd in addition to all the various points of reflection that SNK has to offer (and there are many, not just those listed ), there is a plot full of twists and turns, the suspense. In short, it is a masterpiece. \\nThen, if you are used to an anime where the bad guys magically becomes good after a lesson or in which the characters acquire super powers from nothing or from old men who appearing in their minds...

In the 90s, Dragon Ball Z broke the mainstream walls while Neon Genesis Evangelion opened the doors to the now indispensable late-night anime slots in Japan. In the 2000s, Fullmetal Alchemist marked the peak of manga-to-anime adaptations while Code Geass & Death Note headed the class of those who introduced the new anti-hero genre. And now, in 2013, Attack on Titan has shaken the industry once again. Unless you\\'ve been living under a rock for the past 5 months, you should at least know what the story is about, and for the sake of staying spoiler free, I\\'m notgoing into details on the plot.\\n\\nBefore I wrote this review, I wrote a different piece moments after watching the first episode stating that Attack on Titan had all the potential to become a landmark anime, knowing very little of how true that statement would turn out to be.\\n\\nI have watched anime ever since I can remember. I have seen the very best and the worst that this industry has to offer. And I, like most of you, am very familiar with the relationship of manga-anime adaptation, which is the case of Attack on Titan. It is because of such experience and knowledge that I am able to say with so much confidence that Attack on Titan is the best anime series ever produced from any standpoint, at least, in the last decade.\\n\\nAttack on Titan is such a well-done product that it has all the key strong points we all dream every series could have. By this I mean the story, characters, animation, OST, opening/ending sequences, art, directing, narrative, character development, and, most importantly, the \"it\" factor. These are all present with \"A grade\" production values. \\n\\nFirst of all, I want to start with the OST. Simply put, Attack on Titan\\'s soundtrack rivals that of Rurouni Kenshin and Evangelion. Period. Don\\'t misunderstand, they are not similar by any means, they are simply equally as masterful. Check on the internet the impressions left by fans about the first soundtrack. And if you still don\\'t believe me, tweet Hideo Kojima (creator of Metal Gear series) and ask his take on it.\\n\\nThe OST is extremely important in this show because it allows you to feel the many epic moments that dwell in this 25 episode marvel. This is where the directing and narrative play a big role. For those of you who have seen Death Note (same director), you will feel an extra feeling of similarity with Attack on Titan, as the show relies heavily on its intense emotional scenes which you most certainly will feel the first 2 minutes of episode #1. \\n\\nIt is in these scenes where the golden cast of characters shine. I cannot stress enough how unique the characters are. You could say they are the cream of the many accolades that Attack on Titan has. I\\'m still amazed by the quality of voice actors that just seem to just pop out in this show. The voices of so many main characters from hit series come together in Attack on Titan to help provide that epic feeling you start to get once episode #1 ends. Note I emphasize the voice acting because it\\'s part of the anime but, obviously, not of the manga. \\n\\nAnother key strong point is the work and effort put on the OP/ED sequences. If you\\'ve come this far in my review then you most likely understand when I say that Openings and Ending sequences are crucial. They provide that extra excitement to the show. It\\'s definitely something not all anime series take seriously. Fortunately, Wit Studio took them seriously, and then came \"Guren no Yumiya\". The second opening, \"Jiyuu no Tsubasa\" is outstanding and marvelous in its own way and the second ending, \"great escape\", fuels that adrenaline rush of excitement you will get after those killing cliffhangers. Having said that, the first OP, \"Guren no Yumiya\", is simply epic. If there was ever something to describe as epic, it would be this OP. I am certain that as of today, it is the greatest anime opening ever. I\\'m amazed by the amount of attention it got on the internet and the hundreds of parodies derived from it. It was simply a treat to our eyes. The song. The animation in the opening. The sync between the two. Epic. \\n\\nYou won\\'t be skipping that opening.\\n\\nIn addition, an animation production is never as close to perfection without the animation and art being top class. Now, Attack on Titan has astonishing art, to the point where you are amazed of how far animation has come. The scenes where there is sunlight will leave you speechless. The animation, unlike the other aspects, is where some disagree. The only thing I have to say is I was extremely impressed throughout the whole show until I saw a certain scene in episode #11 where the 3D maneuver gear was used, and I was stunned. I was simply stunned. Then, of course, later episodes also take it to a whole new level, but you\\'re probably gonna be used to that quality of greatness by then.\\n\\nThat\\'s how ridiculously good Attack on Titan is.\\n\\nNow, like the characters, the story is mostly work of the manga\\'s author. This includes character development, which I believe is the key to the success and extreme popularity of the characters. Also, the story maybe the most original aspect of this series. Nothing you have seen before is in this show. Nothing. Much like EVA, Attack on Titan gives you a world of \"dystopia\", on-edge, and uncertainty, so full of potential that just when you think you have it figured it out, it turns around and leaves you speechless. \\n\\nOh, that will happen to you for the first time in episode #5. Guaranteed. \\n\\nFinally, even IF all these characteristics of an anime series are top notch, it won\\'t amount to its potential if it doesn\\'t have that \"IT\" factor. Some series have the \"IT\" factor without having all of these production values. They tend have 3 or 4 at most. Those become popular because they give out that feeling of \"amazing\". Gintama, the greatest gag series ever, comes to mind. Its anime doesn\\'t have overwhelming OST, or eye popping animation; it does have A class characters and A class story (among others), but that \"IT\" factor takes it to another level. Now, imagine having practically everything an anime series has to offer in A class value while also having that \"IT\" factor. Extremely rare. Eva rare. FMA rare. Attack on Titan is part of that elite group. This is why its popularity rose to highs only few series reach.\\n\\nThis is the first time I have ever written a detailed review of an anime series. I did it because this one deserves it. It\\'s The anime series of my adult era. I can now relate to those anime fans who watched Evangelion almost 20 years ago. They knew they had something special, just like we do now with Attack on Titan. \\n\\nIn conclusion, Attack on Titan is, of course, like MS Gundam, DBZ, EVA, FMA, Geass, and Death Note, not perfect. Like any other piece of greatness it does have its negatives. Having said that, when you add up the good and the bad, you end up with a landmark anime series that is currently shaking the industry with its mesmerizing, sensational, emotional, intense, and inspiring first season. Just imagine the wait and the hype for season 2. \\n\\nWhat kind of effect will Attack on Titan have on the anime/manga industry we love? Only time will tell...\\n\\nIn the meantime, this is simply the best anime series in the last 15 years. Enjoy.\\n\\nExquisite beyond words.\\n101/100.',\n",
       " 'Shingeki no Kyojin... Where do I start? In summary, Shingeki no Kyojin is a perfect anime to get somebody who loves action started on anime- I think it is literally the most mainstream anime ever made, and that is definitely not a bad thing. But with this comes downsides- ones not apparent to the viewer at first glance, but looking back on it after watching it around the time it first came out, definitely shine through. Shingeki no Kyojin starts off with a roar- the first 2 episodes explode right out of the gate with high-octane action that also leaves mystery to draw the viewer in. Whoare the titans? What is in the basement? Why is Eren\\'s dad so creepy? All this and more the viewer asks themselves as the end credits roll for episode 2.\\n\\nThen episode 3 and 4 jump in. It\\'s a training scene for Eren and his friends, and it\\'s dead slow in comparison. But that\\'s ok- it\\'s episodes like this that reinforce character development and get the plot rolling. And soon, the episodes with action will begin again, right? That High-Octane, bloody, gory action we\\'ve all been waiting for!\\n\\nWell, it does. But then shortly after, it grinds back to a halt. Why do I bring up the first 5 episodes out of all things to mention about Shingeki no Kyojin? Because it perfectly frames the pacing of the entire anime. First you\\'re baited with that sweet, bloody action that makes you just stare at the screen in amazement of the beautiful animation and heart-pumping soundtrack, and next thing you know you have to sit through an hour of people arguing over the same issue over and over before going back to the action. This would be fine and acceptable if it actually resulted in plot and character development going somewhere- but rarely this bickering between Armin and Eren result in anything productive.\\n\\nActually, Shingeki no Kyojin seems to show perfectly how to pull off the ILLUSION of plot and character development- Eren struggling with his inner demons despite somehow going back to square 1 every 5 episodes, the Basement which has been explicitly mentioned as having \"all the answers\" being completely forgotten about while the group goes out to hunt titans, and Armin rehashing what we already know to other characters every episode or two. All of this combined create a huge mess that on first glance seems like a deep and interesting story, but only through reflection of a different lens you begin to notice how shallow the pool you\\'re standing in really is. The characters are shallow, the story tries to go somewhere but the characters almost seem to prevent it from moving at all, and at some points the story tries to go to too many places at once, just confusing the viewer until the next trippy action scene kicks in.\\n\\nI like to compare Shingeki no Kyojin to a Michael Bay film. This also makes it easier to understand what I\\'m trying to say (and trust me, it\\'s not your fault- I have a hard time expressing what I feel in words sometimes).\\n\\nImagine Eren as Shia Labeouf, and Shingeki no Kyojin as a typical summer blockbuster by Michael Bay. Eren zips around the scenes of the movie, fighting bad-guys and pulling off amazing stunts with beautifully rendered graphics and an amazing ost- but then hardcut to Eren getting mad at himself and people around him but not actually advancing the plot for 1/3rd of the movie as the action grinds to a halt. Add some comedic relief (if you want a Bay comparison, the classic transformers out of place masturbation joke fits well) including possibly some potatoes after a traumatic scene and then slap on the illusion of having a deep plot and you have Shingeki no Kyojin. It\\'s a typical summer blockbuster! You go in, watch it, enjoy it, then leave and forget about it! I\\'m really not saying you\\'re not allowed to enjoy it because it\\'s shallow and noisy, I\\'m just saying you shouldn\\'t walk in expecting a revolutionary masterpiece of anime- which is what some critics are raising it up to be.\\n\\nSTORY- 4 : The story\\'s foundations are put up well, but the actual progression falls flat as no questions are ever really answered and the plot never seems to want to go in a single direction.\\nART- 9 : The art is amazing! There are some worse-off scenes and some animation glitches, but the art is one of the things that makes Shingeki no Kyojin stand out from the crowd. Even though I am not a huge fan of the anime itself, I have a massive poster above my computer of it as we speak.\\nSOUND- 10 : While the music and sound design is generic at worst, it is composed beautifully and always reinforces the mood set out by the show. I would highly recommend a download of the OST.\\nCHARACTER- 3 : Easily the worst part of Shingeki no Kyojin. Eren\\'s constant back and forth attitude and behaviour that never goes anywhere, Armin\\'s arguing with people that last an entire episode simply to recap what just happened on screen, Mikasa\\'s constant fight to try and save everyone and pull everything together: it\\'s just all poorly done.\\nENJOYMENT- 6 : While watching Shingeki no Kyojin, I certainly enjoyed it- but I wouldn\\'t say I enjoyed it the whole way through. Even while watching it, I noticed a lot of the fighting and arguing was going on too long, and let\\'s not forget the 3-5 episodes of riding on horses. But the scenes that were enjoyable- notably the fight scenes and the pivotal plot twists certainly left a lot to talk about and were enjoyable enough to at least somewhat wipe away two annoying characters yelling at eachother on horses for 30 minutes.\\n\\nOVERALL- 5: Watch it, get what you get out of it, but don\\'t walk in expecting the next amazing revolutionary anime. Expect a summer blockbuster.',\n",
       " 'Every once in a while, and even more frequently now than in the past, an anime appears that is completely and unequivocally shrouded in layers upon layers of hype and popularity from the anime community. It\\'s the show that\\'s on everyone lips, as well as everyone\\'s TV screens. In the Fall of 2011, The Future Diary created an exceptional level of hype that had not been seen for quite some time. When the Summer of 2012 rolled along, it was time for Sword Art Online to take the spotlight, and its own popularity grew toheights far beyond that of The Future Diary. Then, in the Spring of 2013, we were treated to what one could consider the Game of Thrones or the Breaking Bad of the anime industry in terms of sheer popularity; a show that completed engulfed the entire anime community, dwarfing even SAO in popularity, but is this anime truly worthy of the hype that it received?\\n\\n          Our story is set in an alternate universe where, 100 years prior to the events of the story, giant humanoid creatures known as Titans appeared and began consuming and decimating the human population, though with no apparent purpose for doing so. In response, the remainder of humanity built three enormous, circular walls to encompass their entire population and keep the Titans at bay. In this world, we meet three young children Eren Yeager, his adopted sister Mikasa, and their friend Armin, as they live out their peaceful lives in the southernmost city at the edge of the outer wall, Wall Maria. This soon changes, however, when a 60-meter Titan smashes through the main gate of Wall Maria, allowing Titans to freely enter the city and devour every human in sight, and forcing those who lived in the outer districts to retreat behind Wall Rose. During the chaos, Eren witnesses his mother being eaten by a Titan, and now he, Mikasa, and Armin have joined the military in the hopes of acquiring the skills necessary to take vengeance on the creatures that destroyed their lives.\\n\\n          This series, as a whole, has almost completely mastered the art of building suspense, mostly through the use of very long plot arcs. There always seems to be something constantly pushing towards a conclusion, but not actually getting there until several episode later, and that push factor creates a sensation of rarely ever wanting to stop watching for fear of the resolution being just after the episode you just watched. Additionally, this series is also a master of what I call the \"morale builder,\" something that Gurren Lagann has shown mastery of in the past, and there are dozens of moments throughout the series where, no matter how grim and horrifying the situation, it provides an uplifting or rallying feeling that both immerses you in the world its sets up and makes you root for our heroes to the bitter end.\\n\\n          Speaking of grim and horrifying, that comparison to Game of Thrones earlier was far from being an off-handed comment. By this I mean that I hope you don\\'t enjoy getting attached to characters, like I do, as you may find yourself curled up in a corner at some point. In the world of fiction, particularly in action series, there is a concept called \"plot armor,\" which basically means that characters who seem crucial to the plot\\'s progression and the show\\'s stability as a whole are protected from death or other nasty fates that might await them. In this regard, the plot armor for Attack on Titan is about as thick as a used piece of tin foil, and deaths of major characters are frequent and often times unrelenting. In regards to this, and on a more personal note, there are only three anime that have actually made me legitimately cry before. Two of them were KyoAni series, and the third was Attack on Titan. This show really does not care about who your favorite character is, and if you\\'ve made it this far without having had the major deaths in the series spoiled for you yet, then consider yourself lucky.\\n\\n          Unfortunately, there is one minor flaw with this series. There are certain points, especially at some slightly slower moments in the series, where its gets a little too over-dramatic, to the point of almost being ridiculous. This was especially noticeable during what is now referred to as the \"Boulder Arc,\" which encompasses roughly episodes 10-12. These moments are few and far between however, and are immediately drowned out once the hype builds back up again.\\n\\n          On the character front, for the sake of not getting your hopes up about the prospects of certain characters living, I\\'ll talk only about the three main characters I mentioned earlier, with the knowledge that the rest of the cast, while incredibly massive in scale, still serves as a stellar group of vibrant personalities and ideals to create a surprisingly organic social environment. As for the big three, we\\'ll start with Armin, who takes on the \"smart one/strategist\" archetype. While he is fairly generic and standard at the beginning of the series, we get to see him grow into being a more varied character at a constantly shifting rate, and his skills at strategy both on the battlefield and in complex conversations are practically unmatched, often allowing him the power to save the other two from the situations they get themselves into.\\n\\n          Next is Mikasa, who, for the majority of the series, is portrayed as being essentially flawless, taking on the role of the unstoppable badass Titan slayer fresh out of training who also makes time to coddle her adoptive brother, and this flawlessness is built up to the point of it almost being a flaw in itself. There are, however, a few quirks to her personality that make her feel more human, but at the same time make her seem even more distant. Her only notable \"flaw\" seems to be her undying loyalty and devotion to Eren, often throwing caution to the wind and bolting out against orders in order to make sure he\\'s safe. This also leads to some rather disquieting moments where her own sanity seems to abandon her and, to put it lightly, causes her to act excessively hostile towards anyone who means ill will towards Eren.\\n\\n          Finally, we have Eren, our stereotypical \"perseverance\" character whose sole motivation for the majority of the season is taking revenge on the Titans, and while this does seem like a bit of a gaping flaw for the show\\'s main character, it\\'s actually both understandable and sort of refreshing. His intense focus on his own rage and desires for revenge slowly consumes part of who he is, which becomes especially present at several points throughout the series that I can\\'t go further into detail on due to massive amounts of spoilers.\\n\\n         The animation was produced by Wit Studios, a new studio that serves as a surrogate of Production I.G. Regardless of its heritage, for a new studio to create such a massively impressive project is beyond incredible. Not only is the animation well-polished, but it also carries its own distinctive style, most notably in the fact that its characters are heavily outlined in varying thicknesses of black to make them pop out from the background. Speaking of backgrounds, the environments are shown to be incredibly rich and detailed despite how unvaried they may appear on the surface, and the action shots give us plenty of different perspectives on this environment. As for the action itself, Wit Studios has no qualms at all with handing out incredible fight sequences by the barrel-full via an in-world tool used by humanity\\'s military known as 3D Maneuver Gear, allowing us to break away from standard ground combat and enter the world of high-flying intensity, with soldiers bolting off of every building in sight, into the air above them, and landing blade-first on the neck of a Titan. On course, all of these brilliant combinations of animation are to be expected from Araki, who has already brought us both the intensely stylized atmosphere of Death Note and the blood-pumping action of Guilty Crown.\\n\\n         The dub was produced by FUNimation, and, as someone who watched the subbed version first, I have no problems whatsoever recommending this dub. From heavy-hitting new favorites like Josh Grelle and Matthew Mercer to classic icons like Vic Mignogna and Caitlin Glass, Funimation has pulled out all the stop to create one of the best dubs this side of 2010. Grelle shuffles between nervously unstable and frantically stern for his portrayal as Armin, and Trina Nishimura pulls off both Mikasa\\'s warmth and ferocity to near perfection. My only notable flaw with the dub is Bryce Papenbrook as Eren. To be fair, this is definitely Papenbrook\\'s best performance yet, due in no small part to Mike McFarland\\'s exceptional voice directing, but he does still tend to get a bit \"Bryce-y\" at some points and lets his excessively angsty style boil over, which is a rather dangerous idea considering Eren\\'s character. Overall though, this is a minor blemish on an otherwise excellent dub.\\n\\n         The music was composed by Hiroyuki Sawano (Aldnoah.Zero, Kill la Kill), and this soundtrack is definitely one of the best to come out of anime in a long time, based in heavy orchestrations and laced throughout with electronica and hard rock. From the bombastic explosions of \"E.M.A\" and main theme \"Attack on Titan\" to the insert tracks of \"The Reluctant Heroes\" and \"Doa,\" this soundtrack dabbles in the art of perfection on all fronts. If it seems like I\\'m being much more in-depth with the soundtrack than usual, it\\'s because I\\'ve actually purchased the soundtrack on iTunes and have been listening to it practically non-stop, and I highly recommend making this purchase as well. Both opening themes, \"Guren no Yumiya\" and \"Jiyuu no Tsubasa,\" were performed by Linked Horizon and give us massive eruptions of heavy rock combined with brass and vocal choirs (and on a quick aside, I\\'m one of the few people that actually preferred the second theme more than the first, though the first still kicks all sorts of ass). The first ending theme \"Utsukushiki Zankoku na Sekai\" by Yoko Hikasa gives us a rolling ballad to play us out of each episode, while the second ending theme \"great escape\" by Cinema Staff blasts through with a heavy rock track. Additionally, all of these tracks except \"great escape\" are available for purchase on iTunes, purchases that I also highly recommend.\\n\\n         Overall, Attack on Titan is simply an incredible experience, combining high-flying action that could even make ufotable nervous with a dark and nearly-overwhelming sense of fear and desperation, and this anime is more than deserving of the hype that it receives. However, as it stands right now, on November 4, 2014, the series is incomplete, and there has been no announcement of a second season yet. I highly doubt that this second season will never come however, and it has been reported that the original manga is planned to be finished in about four years’ time (which actually isn\\'t that much material for a monthly manga). In the meantime, there will be plenty of specials and spin-offs to keep us satiated until season 2 is officially announced.\\n\\n          Attack on Titan is currently licensed by FUNimation and is available from them for both streaming and purchase.',\n",
       " 'Attack on Titan is a particularly unique case for me. As such, my review needs to be broken up to properly analyze it. Story: Attack on Titan has an absolutely astounding setting. The sheer idea behind the setting, the exposition pieces, and the initial plot elements held the potential for it to be one of the best action anime ever. From the first three episodes, I could see how someone could believe this would be that one anime that is just absolutely amazing. It simply becomes disappointing as things continue. Long story short? The start is absolutely amazing. It\\'s powerful. It\\'s grabbing. It does everythingan introduction should do. The problem after that stems from the plot slowly becoming painfully predictable and a personal dissatisfaction with the protagonists in place as well as the decisions of various members of the cast completely destroying the story\\'s credibility at times. \\n\\nArt:\\n\\nArt is completely subjective. I would not actually judge art based on someone\\'s own opinion. You would really have to see it for yourself to deem whether it is \"good\" or not. As for me, it seemed fairly mediocre. The effort is there, but something with the art style simply does not jive with me. The settings are well done, but the characters are quite bland. \\n\\nSound:\\n\\nFinally. This is what I can praise Attack on Titan for. If anything, this series\\'s soundtrack deserves to be remembered. It is excellent and its execution throughout the anime was not only strategic but tasteful. The tracks range from dark and depressing to powerful and moving pieces designed for a battle against a completely hopeless situation. In my opinion, the music in and of itself is the true beauty behind this anime. \\n\\nCharacters: \\n\\nThe main protagonist Eren Jeager is heavily set on his goal to a fault. Some call this good writing, but given the setting, it actually works against the story and its credibility. It is literally almost difficult to not find the main character\\'s obsession with revenge nostalgic and downright hilarious. If you don\\'t like avenger-type characters, you will despise Eren beyond imagination by the time the story is over. The worst part? He finally starts developing three-quarters through and goes right back to the bratty child he was in the first few eps. The same can be said of Mikasa. This anime is one of the few to portray women with some form of decency, but Mikasa\\'s obsession with Eren is a pretty sad window of how the author wants people to worship his poorly-designed protagonist. To boot, Mikasa literally has no flaws other than her obsession with Eren. No character flaws. No ability flaws. Her only real flaw is her obsession with Eren, which usually only winds up helping them, not causing them problems like it should. Your only real likable protagonist? Armin. He is one of maybe three characters we really see that has a solid character, solid flaws, and solid development based on those flaws and his interactions with other characters due to the plot. In all honesty, Armin should have been the main protagonist. \\n\\nEnjoyment:\\n\\nNow we move onto enjoyment. Despite vehemently despising roughly eighty-five percent of the cast, I enjoyed Attack on Titan. Is it a great action anime? Sure. Definitely! Is it realistic? Sad to say, but no it is not. Is it the most well-written anime ever? Astronomically far from it. If you\\'re looking for an action anime to sit down and enjoy, this is a wonderful choice. If you\\'re looking for an action anime with a strong plot and emphasis on lovable characters, I recommend pretending that you never heard the hype and staying far away from this anime. \\n\\nWith a heavy heart, I cannot give the anime anything higher than a 5/10 in good conscience. It had oodles of potential, but an irritating cast, some half-baked plot elements, and predictability ruined it. Mediocre at best.',\n",
       " 'So what on earth? What have I done? How am I not able to feel the stun?... I will write about \"Attack on Titan\" here; but yeah, I\\'m no fanboy trying to endear myself to mainstream now or in the longer run. I turned towards this show unbiased considering its popularity at highest. I wanted to see if this action show at least conveys more meanings than being a bloody feast.But in the end: people and story at its driest.\\n\\nSo hundreds of years ago, the humankind\\nis letting itself be completely confined\\nby dim-witted looking titans there\\ninside a 50-meter wall ensnare\\nand is now searching for ways to get behind.\\n\\nThen suddenly, a 60-meter giant attacks\\nand many more titans are making their tracks.\\nThe wall can\\'t hold it anymore\\nand so the humans are fighting another war.\\nTheir enemies won\\'t give them more time to relax!\\n\\nThe first few episodes are quite intense,\\nexperiencing human\\'s crumbling defence,\\ngetting their normal lives torn up again,\\nhaving to survive in a diminishing den,\\nand nearly losing their last kind of sense.\\n\\nWe follow Eren, who has to sustain\\nhis mother\\'s loss, indeed a great pain.\\nHe wants to kick some titan\\'s ass\\nand finally falls into the shounen mass,\\nalways acting like tightened by an angry chain.\\n\\nAccompanied by one of the few\\nmore normal humans, Mikasa, whose true\\nintention is to save her Eren\\nand so she\\'s getting ears more barren\\ndespite her strength she would rather sue.\\n\\nThe third in league, weak fair-haired Armin, stays\\nthe cowardly one with a frightened face.\\nHe tends to think far more than others\\nbut is mostly hindering his brothers.\\nHe needs lots of time to realise his place.\\n\\nSo maybe you would think that some other\\nguys inside these walls don\\'t try to bother,\\nbut instead act more heroic inside this hell.\\nYou see, Commander Levi\\'s the only one memorable;\\nhe wouldn\\'t even trade his tenacity for his mother.\\n\\nAll in all, these characters just won\\'t try\\nto develop properly and we ask why?\\nWhy haven\\'t they used episodes five to twelve\\nto let them build some features or delve\\ninto their motivations or what they go by?\\n\\nSeriously, you won\\'t remember any other names.\\nThey die like flies and only the main remains.\\nSo I really wondered the whole time where\\nthe more seasoned soldiers would deign to dare\\nto get into the fight, but you know what it claims...\\n\\nAnd then, the probably most important thing:\\nWhat are the titans?

       " 'I started watching Shingeki no Kyojin a year ago, almost to the day that I am writing this. So I figured I would write a review on what has grown to be one of my favourite series of all time. What I\\'ve noticed is that people tend to be very split about this anime; you either love it, or you hate it. Clearly, in my case, I love this entire series (the show, the manga, the side-stories, etc.) Now onto the actual review. Story: 9 At its core, Shingeki no Kyojin is something that we have seen many times in the past: humanity is being attacked, therefore wemust defend ourselves. Many, many iconic shows start from this format. However, SNK (as I will be calling it for the rest of the review) takes this simple plot point and expands it into something very, very unique. We have the Titans: giant, humanoid creatures set on devouring humans. Because of the Titans, humanity has been driven behind three walls, with the population dwindling to less than 1% of our current population. \\n\\nEach and every single plot point in this series is completely thought out and executed stunningly. There are so many twists that you won\\'t be able to see coming. Hell, check out episode 8- you\\'ll be shocked. Even the filler is thought out, and has important significance to the main story. The story of SNK goes even further in the manga. At the time of writing this review, there has been 59 chapters released, and we are just only starting to scratch the surface of this world.\\n\\nLike most things out there, SNK does have its flaws. But the flaws are so minuscule that it\\'s very, very hard to notice them. The brilliant storytelling of this series completely blew me away from episode 1, which is why it deserves a near perfect score.\\n\\nArt: 9\\nIf you have read the SNK manga, you\\'ll know that the art, while it is good, isn\\'t amazing. The anime cleaned up all of the character designs, leaving us with a beautiful result. While there were some minor changes in characters (ex Eren\\'s eye colour, Levi\\'s physique, etc,) the anime designs did stay pretty true to the original material. The designs match the characters\\' personalities completely, which is something that not a lot of shows can brag about.\\n\\nAnd the animation is breathtaking. Every single sky we see, the birds eye views; the scenery in this anime is absolutely stunning. And the animation for the characters and their situations is pretty great, too. To me, this is digital animation to the finest degree. But again, as is the case with most shows, SNK does have some animation flaws. For example, in one episode, the same frame is shown about three times. The characters can also have a case of \"far away face\", but that is pretty common. Again, these flaws in animation are pretty small, and are barely noticeable when you are watching the show. They do not take away from the rest of the show.\\n\\nSound: 10\\nThe score for SNK was done by Hiroyuki Sawano. If you don\\'t recognize his name, he also composed the score for things like Kill la Kill, Ao no Exorcist, and more recently Aldnoah.Zero. If I could use any one word to describe the sound of SNK, it would be flawless. The score matches every scene perfectly, mixing electronics with more orchestral pieces. If you don\\'t have any interest in watching the show, I would still suggest you download the OSTs. The sound for this show blew me away. Even the background noises, the additional sound FX- they were all done to the utmost perfection.\\n\\nThe openings and endings for SNK were all absolutely amazing. It\\'s no wonder that Guren no Yumiya in particular has landed on many \"top 10 anime openings\" lists. The songs will get stuck in your head, and refuse to leave. In my case, they have not left in a year, and that\\'s something that is very hard to do in my case. Just check out the OPs and EDs online; you\\'ll be amazed at how great they are.\\n\\nAnd the voice acting is nothing to laugh at, either. With many shows that I\\'ve seen, I\\'ve noticed that the voices don\\'t match with the characters. Either the voice is too weak, too bold, meek, etc- this is not the case with SNK. Each character is voiced perfectly; each voice matches the personality of the character. The passion put into the voice acting of the show is nothing to laugh at. The voice actors were able to portray each and every line and emotion perfectly, which is something very hard to do. The dub is a different story (but we don\\'t talk about the dub....)\\n\\nCharacter: 9\\nThis is where most people decided whether they love or hate this show. To be fair, the characters in SNK can sometimes seem a little extreme with their personalities. However, I love them. For example, the main character Eren can seem very angry, very passionate. Some people hate this. They think he\\'s just a trope amped up to the extreme. In my opinion, Eren\\'s character was done perfectly. His \"extreme\" emotions fit his personality up to a T. \\n\\nThe personalities of each character in this show are fleshed out near perfectly, in my opinion. Again, some aspects can seem extreme, but that is part of the enjoyment of this series. Not one character is deemed as \"perfect.\" They each have their flaws, which makes them seem very human and realistic. As the story goes on, each point in each characters\\' personality is explained in detail, even if it seems unimportant initially.\\n\\nEach character in this series serves a purpose. The main characters, the main supporting characters, the regular supporting characters- each and every one of them is important. There is a lot of death in this show, but every single death we see is important to the story and the character development. And while some deaths may seem insignificant, they really aren\\'t. The entire emotional journey of this series stems from the characters, and SNK has pretty powerful ones.\\n\\nEnjoyment: 10\\nI\\'m not a fan of blood and gore. Really, I\\'m not. There have been several shows, live-action or animated, that I have had to drop because of their content. When a show like SNK, which has copious amounts of both blood and gore, can become one of my favourites, you know that it is amazing.\\n\\nEvery single episode of SNK had me captivated. Even the filler ones. Each and every episode was an emotional journey from start to finish. Waiting for the episodes to air every week was torture, because I so desperately wanted to see everything happen (even if I had already read the manga.) I loved every single episode, even the OVAs that have been released. Each release had me on edge, with both the show and the manga. Nothing was dull; everything was riveting.\\n\\nOverall: 9\\nThere is a reason why this show doesn\\'t score perfect. It has its flaws, as everything does. But there is also a reason why it scores so high.\\n\\nShingeki no Kyojin was one of the most popular, if not the MOST popular anime of 2013. There is a reason for this. There is a reason why so many people watch, read, and enjoy this series, even if they\\'re not into anime or manga. There is a reason why there are copious amounts of fan works for this series. There is a reason why so much merchandise has been released. There is a reason why so many people cosplay characters from this series.\\n\\nLike it or hate it, you really can\\'t deny how popular it is. I personally love everything about it. Keep in mind that this is only my opinion; other people will tell you different things. But to me, Shingeki no Kyojin is stunning.',\n",
       " \"Let's get straight to it! Shingeki no Kyojin is an incredibly gripping, action packed show, and it is certainly capable of converting non-anime watchers. When you begin to understand the plight of humanity versus the titans, you'll quickly begin to realize that this is a show of epic proportions - essentially it is an inter species war: and violence comes hand in hand with this theme, so squeamish viewers might want to look elsewhere. The show is incredibly engaging, and intense because the combat animations are executed perfectly, giving a really personal front row seat throughout. Not only this but peril is constantly a reinforced aspectof the anime, and what's scarier is the accurate scale of death that isn't afraid to engulf those that the viewer has become connected to.\\n\\nI'm liking this logical order, because with death brings me to the next area i'd like to explain: Drama! Oh boy you'll be astounded by the dramatic, emotional and often angry outbursts of the characters. I personally would rank Shingeki no Kyojin highly in all of its presentation methods.\\n\\nBut that's not all, because in addition to being well presented, violent and dramatic, the show still then has the drive to steer you into corners via breakthroughs in the story. Another beautiful aspect of the show is that although the context would say that humanity had been surviving for over a century, the titans are still a great mystery to the present characters, therefore putting you (the viewer) on the front line for discovering more!\\n\\nDespite how i'm in awe with so many parts of the anime, the story if i'm honest is a bit too linear, as in i don't think enough goes on behind the scenes of titan combat. The plot summary introductions are also a pain due to their repetitiveness, it really is easy to pick up the story line behind the show, yet to an extent where it almost feels like it's been dumbed down.\\n\\nNevertheless, i agree with the masses, this popular anime lives up to its reputation, and you really must see for yourself!\",\n",
       " 'This anime made my mouth open wide for longer than 5 seconds more than a handful times. This is the type of world where more people get killed than the entirety of the A Song of Ice and Fire series. It exists in a timeless universe – not in the past, present or future of our world, but in a pocket universe where Titans existed long before the existence of machines. In this world, machines were not invented to improve humanity’s lifestyle, but for the continuous existence of humanity itself. There’s lots of shouting (especially from Eren), lots of action, lots of character development, and lotsof tears. My friends weren’t kidding. I felt like my ear drums would break from all the intense shouting. I think my mind is forever scarred, what with how everyone got crushed like ants all the time. And my heart has become immune to all other fictional deaths, what with all the deaths I’ve experienced just from this show alone.\\n\\nIt teaches you a lot about what it takes to be a soldier, a survivor. Constantly, people have to be reminded to “FIGHT!” Some lines are repeated all over the anime that it kind of becomes engraved into your head and heart once you’re done with it.\\n\\nIt’s the kind of anime that sticks with you, the kind that leaves you with phantom faces with phantom voices following you around, making you feel as if you’re still living in that universe, even after you’ve told yourself that you’re done with it.\\n\\nThe concept of the villain, and of the world itself, is scary and genius. First off, the villain – the Titan – is basically a stupid giant human cannibal.\\n\\nUnlike other villains, it doesn’t want revenge. It doesn’t want world domination. It doesn’t want power. It doesn’t need to eat. It has lived a hundred years without eating humans. But it is all it ever eats. It doesn’t eat animals. It wants only one thing – and this is just a theory, but it’s one that I can side with, and one that I love the most – to annihilate the existence of humanity.\\n\\nSecond, the fact that it looks human. It is, in every aspect, a human being, except for the fact that it doesn’t have two things; sexual organs, and a conscience. Countless times, characters had their feet rooted to the ground, unable to fight, and I think it’s because the image of a gigantic human biting off a human’s neck is just too fascinatingly cruel that they feel they cannot look away.\\n\\nThe world itself is scarier than the world of the Hunger Games. And I think what makes it scary is the fact that humanity has never won against the Titans, ever. For the past who-knows-how-many-years, Titans have been eating humans.\\n\\nThe humans in this world pretend that they have a system.\\n\\no matter what plan the humans think of, no matter how determined every single one of their skilled soldiers are, they will still be crushed in less than a second without remorse, without even a body to prove that you have existed. This is their anarchy, their ‘chaos’.\\n\\nEvery single man, woman and child in this world lived with losing a loved one as a social norm. It’s a dark fact I’d like everyone to consider. Everyone is already dead, in everyone else’s eyes. That’s what’s sad about this whole thing – even the humans think of other humans as just tiny insects with no importance. But it’s also beautiful, because sometimes, sometimes a character sees through that corrupted notion and calls everyone else out on it, making us realize it along the way too.\\n\\nSo you have a dark world, and an even darker society. Combine that with real-life everyday problems like corruption in the system, hierarchy in social status, differences in privileges and human rights and what do you get? Awesome badass characters who naiively try to fight against it.\\n\\nThe differences in character personality is great, too. There are a few who are extremely righteous, but most of them just really don’t care. They feign an act of indifference, but all for different reasons. But the fact that they had grieved over the death of a loved one united them.\\n\\nAnd I think that’s brilliant. These clashes of personality, and this unity for one tragedy, has bonded them together, and changed them greatly. You get to see how much they have grown in a span of 5-7 years. That’s something I don’t usually see in anime.\\n\\nYou also get to witness the amazing 3D Maneuver Gear.\\n\\nThis made the whole world look kind of sci-fi, but also, kind of not. The 3D Maneuver Gears are as close as we can get to a ‘high tech’ fictional gadget in this world. Every other man made thing you see in the anime is pretty mundane. But the function of it makes the people actually fly. It’s a pretty brilliant concept, and I like how something as complicated as that is a seemingly-ordinary thing for them. Plus, it makes the animation really cool to watch. You gotta respect the amount of effort (and physics, I bet) put just to make sure each maneuver looks even just a little legit.\\n\\nThe music is amazing, too. There were some points where I gaped like a fish because “wHaT just happened omg” and the music dramatically intensified my feelings. So kudos to that! The animation was splendid, hands down. Especially, like I said, with the whole 3D Maneuver thing.',\n",
       " \"There’s a current trend that favors dark and edgy stories such as Game of Thrones, The Walking Dead, and so on. Anime, being no different, saw the much anticipated release of Attack on Titan which is based on the manga of the same name. Given the astronomical amount of hype behind the series it certainly had a lot to live up to. That said, the hype was understandable as Attack on Titan seemed to have everything going for it, being produced by Production I.G., having top notch production values, and a promising premise. Attack on Titan follows the story of Eren and the Survey Corpsas they fight for survival in a world where monstrous beings known as titans terrorize humanity.\\n\\nI was very intrigued by the premise of Attack on Titan. It’s definitely something that stands out and is at least somewhat unique in a sea of all too similar anime. That’s sadly where my praise ends for the series. Unfortunately the execution does not live up to the premise and it's not long before the show turns into glorified torture porn.\\n\\nThe majority of the characters are bland and pretty cookie cutter. This is a huge problem in a series where death and survival are the main aspects, and a character’s death has no impact unless the viewer is attached to them. Without spoiling too much there are one or more important characters that are introduced and die within the span of a single episode. The scenes are supposed to be impactful, yet these characters are barely shown in the one episode they are in creating little emotional payoff. \\n\\nEren has one emotion- anger, and only one way of expressing himself- yelling. Combined with his naive and arrogant attitude and inability to back much of it up, Eren can be a very annoying character. He never really learns from his mistakes nor do other characters react appropriately to it to any meaningful degree. Something that also shatters the illusion of suspense in the series is Eren's ability to shounen his way out of death avarious other situations because writing is hard to do. \\n\\nMikasa is Eren’s sister and plays the part of the cool heroine of few words. She succeeds at everything she does but her biggest accomplishment is being cute despite her manly abs. One could argue her weird and unhealthy obsession with her brother Eren is a flaw, but like most things out of Japan I just assume it's the creator's fetish. I guess it's okay though since she does look good in those tight pants.\\n\\nThe rest of the main cast consists of various other trainees and the Survey Corps. They aren’t really memorable and I couldn’t name more than a handful of them even if my life depended on it. There’s Armin, he’s not so good at fighting but he’s smart or so I'm told. There’s Levi, he’s kind of like Eren's mentor and a male version of Mikasa except for the part about wanting to bang Eren. Well, unless the shipping community has anything to say about it.  \\n\\nThere are a few characters that I felt were somewhat more interesting. Sasha probably has the best characterization out of all the characters, or maybe I just like her potatoes. There is also Hange who has an obsession with studying the titans who also adds much needed personality to series. I think they provide the right amount of levity for the series. The other humor in the show doesn't work as well. It's a bit silly and contrived and interferes with the otherwise grim atmosphere and just makes things feel tonally inconsistent. Most stories do benefit from some type of levity and contrast, but it should be appropriate to tone and not take the viewer out of the story. A good example would be Paranoia Agent, there is an episode dedicated to three people trying to commit suicide that is quite humorous but stays in tune with the show's dark tone while also making for interesting social commentary on Japan's high suicide rate in real life, playing into the overarching themes of the series. It is natural and fits the show with its dry humor, in comparison Attack on Titan literally pulls you out of an serious scene for a cheap laugh, like Armin and Reiner gawking at a pretty blonde girl while they are running for their lives. \\n \\nThere are some other problems, such as pacing issues where the series just grinds to a screeching halt and drags on for a fair bit. A lot of other parts of the story dip into shounen levels of silliness and predictability. I’m still not entirely sure how the transformation aspect of the show works either, besides something about biting your thumb while you have some kind of goal in mind or something very ill thought out. I suppose these are things that aren’t meant to be looked into too deeply. The dialogue is also bad with the characters having to explain every little thing they do or have an internal monologue every five seconds for exposition's sake.\\n\\nThe production values of this show are good. The art and animation are nice and fluid, with the art style itself being very distinctive. The characters have an unusually thick border that outlines that's kind of unique. Character design is pretty good for what the show is trying to do, being more grounded and what not. The technology is pretty neat looking as well, from the 3D maneuver gear to the box cutter swords. The music doesn't thrill me as much as most but has some noteworthy pieces. It’s all fittingly high energy and I don’t have a problem with it. \\n\\nBy now it’s no secret that both the anime and manga versions of Attack on Titan are sweeping successes. Nearly everyone remotely interested in media has watched or has heard of it, including people that weren’t particularly big on anime to begin with. While its success with the mainstream market is commendable I can’t help but feel disappointed with the actual content. I can see Attack on Titan riding the hype wave with the support of the casual market for as long as it can. It doesn’t help that the creator is prostituting the series with several spinoffs, a live action movie, and even going as far as to change the original ending to pander to fans. It’s a shame really, I had high hopes for Attack on Titan but a few big missteps crushed those. Regrettably Attack on Titan will be a story of what could have been instead of what was.\",\n",
       " 'It\\'s nice to have an anime this popular that isn\\'t just tsundere school rom-com no\\' 10746 for a change. But does that alone make said anime great? No, not really. This is a spoiler free review. *Story* *Insert synopsis here* Aside from the monsters being replaced with Titans and the interesting weaponry the people have, we\\'ve definitely seen similar stories in anime before, whether it\\'s Claymore, Blue Gender and maybe even Highschool of the Dead. Leaving that aside though, it doesn\\'t do a very good job with its narrative. The story relies on coincidences, has forced exposition, uneventful pacing and it also has unexplored themes that are tossed away assoon as they\\'re raised.\\n\\nThe setting in general is poorly explored. For example, they make it clear that there\\'s a slave trade going on within these walls, but that issue is never raised again. Apparently they also have religious sects that worship these walls as deities or something, but that\\'s never explored either, aside from killing them off in an ironic and disrespectful manner (hah! that\\'ll teach those religious people for having faith and hope!).  There are even social classes among citizens, and of course, the higher the class, the more evil you are (that\\'s how it works in cliché land), but even that is just there to show us what good people the main characters are by comparison.. They also present corruption within the military and competition amongst its different branches. Granted, the latter is explored a little, but the former is hardly touched and is just there to shock you. So despite how rich the setting seems at first, at the end of the day all you will care for is the fight against the titans since the rest just remains background decoration.\\n\\nIt\\'s a common thing to say that the first episode is Amazing, but I wasn\\'t impressed. To me, the first episode is also the first mistake it made. It seemed deliberately rushed in an attempt to make the audience gasp at the sudden deaths of characters we know nothing about (pure shock effect). \\n\\nThis is the first mistake because the pacing does slow down significantly later on and I think the first episode was the only one worthy of getting fleshed out more, instead of diving in to the massacre straight away. The rest of the episodes don\\'t even exploit most of their slow pacing very well. It has a habit of slowing down deliberately in order to end most episodes on a cliffhanger. Sure, it might raise the tension, but it also serves to make the series less eventful inside its already limited number of episodes (which means less of a story).\\n\\nAnd maybe I\\'m just nitpicking here, but the exposition insults me. It assumes I\\'m a retard who can\\'t put 2 and 2 together and the characters have to go out of their way to explain things about their world that they should already know just by being born there. This show could\\'ve had no dialogue whatsoever and I still could\\'ve picked up on a great deal of what\\'s going on. So the script just comes off as amaturish.\\n\\nAnd like I said, the story also relies on occurrences that are not very likely, but because it involves the main characters, anything is possible. It\\'s nothing that bad or distracting, but I\\'m still gonna go on a limb here and say; that\\'s not good storytelling.\\n\\nLastly, it just ends in the middle of nowhere and leaves you with nothing but another cliffhanger (surprise, surprise).\\n\\nTo be fair though,  the setting is still pretty creative (as unexplored as it is) and it does do a decent job in foreshadowing some interesting plot twists and gradually revealing mysteries, mainly about the Titans. But that\\'s pretty much it and even that is incomplete for now.\\n\\n*Characters*\\n\\nThese are tired shonen characters who are completely out of place.\\nYou have a Mary Sue who\\'s super strong for no good reason, the smart one and mr angry pants.\\n\\nGranted, Eren, the angry one has good reasons to be angry, it\\'s completely understandable. Unfortunately, that\\'s pretty much all he is and it\\'s probably not the best idea to have him as a main character since it gets old really fast.\\n\\nYou also have Mikasa who\\'s an absolute perfect being for some reason (I gave up on questioning it). We can\\'t make her flawed of course since that\\'d mean she\\'ll have room for character depth, we can\\'t have that. And there\\'s simply nothing to remember her for besides her relationship with Eren, being perfect and her sexy lips. So yeah, a lame character with no development and the most ludicrous backstory I\\'ve seen in a while, which also happens to be Eren\\'s backstory. Which explains why she\\'s his pet.\\nNice..\\n\\nThe third character is Armin, the weak but smart one. I guess he\\'s ok, since he does seem to grow more than the other two.. Aside from that he\\'s forgettable as well since this show\\'s characterization in general is very shonenish and obnoxious in an otherwise dark setting. \"The power of friendship!\" (ok, they don\\'t actually say that, but they come pretty close).\\n\\nBy the way, these 3 characters are each supposed to complete each other with their traits, which is a nice idea, but that fact is stated directly to the viewer, much like everything else in this series (so much for subtlety).\\n\\nThere\\'s also another notable character named Jean, who\\'s kinda like the Vegeta or the rival in a shonen series. And much like Vegeta, he\\'s the only one who goes through actual growth and he even reacts to the events in a way that resembles a human being. Too bad he wasn\\'t the main character, he suits the grim setting much better than the others.\\n\\nThe secondary characters are defined mainly by their quirks or their looks and there are others who are just evil for the sake of being hated by the audience and aren\\'t shown more than once. Many secondary characters aren\\'t fleshed out and the vast majority of deaths in this series are of nameless characters or ones you don\\'t remember. It\\'s understandable considering the circumstances, but that just makes the main cast appear more plot armored than they already are. \\n\\nOn the other hand, the characterization of common people during the intense moments is pretty decent. Probably a little over the top at times, but I still think it was handled rather well with how they panic and such.\\n\\nOverall the characters could\\'ve been worse, I mean at least they have character consistency, they are given some focus and I should probably applaud them for not being overly sexualized, which is a very rare thing in anime these days. But I have no clue what people see in them since most of them are pretty simple and feel ridiculously out of place.\\n\\n*Art &amp; Sound*\\n\\nI\\'ll cover this part more briefly.\\n\\nThe character designs are kind of unique, I guess. I actually like the thick outlines the artwork has, you really don\\'t see those much anymore.  The surroundings look beautiful, both the forests and the towns. Everything just seems gigantic. The animation itself (while not always consistent) is great and the battles with the 3d camera movement is one of the most amazing things I\\'ve ever seen. Though I wasn\\'t too thrilled about most of the Titan designs, and some are significantly cooler than others.\\n\\nThe opening song is arguably one of the best openings in recent years, it\\'s just masterful (too bad opening 2 happened midway). Same goes for the soundtrack in general which is beautifully intense and makes everything seem more epic. The voice acting is nothing special and maybe even over the top, but I realize that the script probably told them to scream a lot, which is not always easy to pull off so give them some slack.\\n\\n\\n*Enjoyment*\\n\\nI enjoyed some of it, but from a point on I mainly just watched it apathetically. I do concede that it\\'s not a boring watch, that\\'s for sure.\\n\\n*Overall* 6/10\\n\\nI\\'ve been mostly negative in this review, but to be fair it was still a fine show, or at least passable in some respects and the production values are great. But I doubt it will stand the test of time',\n",
       " \"The hype of 2013 leading to an ending that closed off lots of action and questions throughout its run. With an anime that has a lot of hype, comes a lot of conflict between haters and people who genuine enjoy the anime. Shingeki no Kyojin is an anime that made peaks in sales and getting fans world wide, but is it really worth watching? The concept of humanity being at the brink of extinction, this is one emphasizes it's fight for survival and the ups and downs of their fight for victory. With the first episode starting off with a great clincher to get youexcited for the rest of series, you get a little view of how each character is and their view point towards the situation. \\n\\nDue to the story of humans being driven to extinction, you often get an anime that can be a hit or a miss depending on how they unravel it throughout the series. Humans are declining with titans appearing onto earth and they eventually make a wall tall enough to the point where even the tallest titan can't break through. \\n\\nWith the show being a fight for survival, it does an excellent job actually dragging out the battle to its actual length. With anime these days battle scenes are usually only an episode with the exception of it being mostly dialog. Attack on Titan has arcs of each fight against the titans or progress in the story. You're given arcs that focus on a battle to take back a city, an expedition outside the walls, and even a battle taking place inside their safest town. \\n\\nThroughout the anime you get stories of some characters past and they're definitely something that makes each character enjoyable and much more interesting to watch as the series progresses forward. The characters are mainly focuses on Eren, Mikasa and Armin. They're what drives the story and is the foundation for all the events that happen.\\n\\nYou have the main character Eren, a boy who does before he thinks. This often gets him into a lot of fights and is what drives his friends to do more than they expect they can do. With his mother being eaten in front of him, you get a lot of realism towards his feelings to the situation and an actual reason for his hate rather than the generic hero title.\\n\\nSecond you have Mikasa, a girl who is brave and does anything to protect Eren. They're not related, but they're brother and step-sister, but act just like siblings. They bicker and often get into fights due to different feelings  and agreements. She's usually level-headed and very mature, but you'll see when something happens to Eren, she breaks down and becomes very agitated. \\n\\nLastly you have Armin, hes the brains of the group and emotional support for both of them. While lacking in physical strength he excels in strategy and decision making. While not being the main focus of the anime, he's probably the character with the most development. At the start hes weak and afraid, but towards the end he becomes mentally strong and definitely a changed person due to the events that occur to him and his friends.\\n\\nWith anime being military themed, you're given characters who are joined in with them due to squads and become their friends. You have characters who disagree with a lot of what they do, and some that are just like them and get along well. The side characters are also important for what happens and really drive the story with their back stories and talent that they bring to the group.\\n\\nKnown for having excellent art, I have nothing to say that can disagree with that. The art through the entire anime stays at top quality and even has detail in every aspect of the show. With all the scenery being changed constantly through the battles, you see buildings that were once standing being ruined and detail in everything. You can see the emotion on all of the characters faces as they witness their comrades being eaten alive. \\n\\nThe scenery seems to be staged in what seems like Europe, you see a lot of forests and old-style buildings. With all the scene changes you can see detail in everything such as trees, buildings and even the clothes that the characters wear. It makes it feel like the Middle Ages or so, with the wool and texture the clothes has.\\n\\nThanks to the theme of extiction, you get 2 wonderful openings to hype you for the anime. With the first half being set around emphasizing their survival, you get an opening that has lots of action and despair to give the feeling of struggle the characters are going through. The second half is more towards the counter attack that mankind has and their subtle victories and their path towards winning against the titans. The opening gives that feeling of excitement and shows their steps to becoming closer to surviving and prospering once again. With battles happening constantly and emotion going across the board with characters dying, or even victory, you get excellent background music to support those feelings even more. \\n\\nOverall this anime is something that lives up to its hype and does a good job having a really serious tone, but also giving off some comedy to balance it out. The story is something that has been done often, but this is one that emphasizes humanities survival. The art is top quality and is the best of the 2013 season to make every battle scene beautiful and movements very clean. The characters were all really well developed and really makes the viewer sad when they die, even though they've only just been introduced a few episodes ago. Anyone who enjoys an action or looking for a great anime to pass time, this is definitely worth checking out.\",\n",
       " \"Shingeki no Kyojin is an amazingly written story with a very dark premise and a lot of action. This is definitely not a series for the faint of heart, especially those with fears of man-eating giants that don't even have the decency to kill you before they eat you (sometimes). The story keeps you guessing as it progresses, there's a new reveal that completely destroys what you thought you knew and makes you wonder just how far the rabbit hole goes. The characters are very relatable and you really do want to see them succeed. What makes this series unique however is the protagonists veryrarely ever win a battle. Every mission the cast engage in usually ends in a blood bath, but it's not without purpose. The gruesome deaths we witness just cements how high the stakes are in this story, and the determination of the protagonists to push forward is very inspiring.\\nAnother unique thing about the cast is they are rather three-dimensional in comparison to a lot of anime and manga I've seen. Where I expect some characters to be completely flat jerkasses or emotionless bastards, there's always something that really makes you like them. The series also makes a point of establishing that no matter what you see on the outside, the characters certainly feel and act human deep down. This makes it really heart breaking when you see characters you like die in the line of duty, and only makes you want to see the good guys succeed all the more, which serves to make their victories so much sweeter.\\ntl;dr, This series is a must-read/watch. If you have a weak stomach or a phobia for cannibalistic slasher smiles, give it a miss. Otherwise, give it your full attention.\",\n",
       " 'If you’re an anime or manga patron, you’ve more than likely heard of, if you haven’t already read or seen, a series entitled Shingeki no Kyojin (Attack on Titan). Based on the popular manga, Shingeki no Kyojin had been made into an anime in 2013, that had literally taken the entire world by storm. It\\'s even been airing on American Television alongside other popular shows such as One Piece and Naruto. It’s popularity is getting to the point where it’s damn near impossible to say the word “anime” without someone bringing up Shingeki no Kyojin. But is Shingeki no Kyojin worth the hype? Plot: One-hundredyears prior to the start of the series, mankind was plagued by their predators, The Titans, gigantic humanoid creatures whose only purpose in existence is to devour humans, despite having no apparent need to eat in order to survive. Humanity was driven to the brink of extinction. The few surviving humans built a society behind 50-meter walls that kept the Titans out. The walls were named Maria, the outermost wall, Rose, the middle, and Sina, the interior. There, humanity enjoyed a century of peace... Until... Our main characters, teenage boy Eren Yeager and his foster sister Mikasa Ackerman witness something horrific... The city\\'s \"divine\" walls are destroyed by a colossal titan that appears out of thin air. As the smaller titans flood the city, the two kids watch in horror as their mother along with thousands of other humans are eaten alive. Eren vows to murder every single titan and take revenge for all of mankind. And so, mankind finds their secret weapon in defeating the Titans... \\n\\nFirst thing you may be wondering, is this anime as epic as everyone says it is, and is it filled with amazing action scenes? Well eh, I guess you could say that it\\'s a tiny bit, not too much, but just a teeny bit ... IT\\'S DEFINITELY EPIC. This anime\\'s introduction of the 3D maneuver gear was certainly an creative pleasant to the say the least, surprise. The way the characters jump/literally fly from rooftop to rooftop, swinging their dual swords at Titans, screaming their lungs at every second leaves the viewers mouths opened, and their eyes glued onto the screen. May I add that the soundtrack in this anime is arguably the best set of music in an anime ever. It\\'s epic music certainly adds to the suspense of every single episode in Shingeki no Kyojin. The only thing I\\'d say took away from the EPICness in Shingeki, was that there was awfully too many dialogue scenes... Although some were pretty nerve-wrecking, others seemed to be useless and pointless.\\n\\nSecondly... is this plot depressing? Yup. Are there multiple scenes that have brought me to tears? Yup. Have I witnessed characters I love meet their end in horribly gruesome ways? Yup. This is not an anime for the faint-hearted. Shingeki no Kyojin will ruthlessly rip your heart out, throw it into a grinder, then turn it into processed dog food time after time after time ... after time again. This anime is also quite gory, so if you can\\'t stand that, I\\'d... still recommend you to give Shingeki no Kyojin a try. \\n\\nAs for me, what I had wondered the most were, is this plot deep (theme)? efficiently written? And enjoyable to watch? Is there an explanation for everything that happens or is it one of those anime that something happens for no reason or leaves me going What happened to the _____ or how did he/she even know _____.\\nThe storyline itself has no contradictions, is full to the brim with plot twists that are almost impossible to predict. And most importantly, it is VERY enjoyable to watch.\\n\\n(Skip if you don\\'t care about historical information + deep themes) Well I will say that the plot has a deep theme. The circle of life and escaping every-day routine and achieving freedom (humans trapped within walls, never seeing the ocean, mountains, volcanoes, forests, plains, and never having an adventure until...) concept is included in the plot. What was also quite intriguing that you probably didn\\'t know was in Shingeki no Kyojin was the use of Norse Allusions. Narrative tales for centuries have, for centuries, been borrowing and re-constructing myths from previous generations in order to create new tales to amuse and inspire. Mythology has been incorporated into many stories to provide emphasis on major themes and create a more complex universe for the reader to experience. “Shingeki no Kyojin” written by Hajime Isayama draws extensive inspiration Nordic myth such as Snorri’s “Gylfaginning” and “Prose Edda,” creating integral elements and parallels within the story by incorporating fundamental Norse ideologies into the fictional universe’s framework. It is these elements of inter-textuality that create a context in which hermetic moments can be experienced, while expressing creativity through the literary tradition of interpretation through connotation. As for the circle of life, humans for once are on the side of the preys. Why is it wrong for titans to eat us, while it\\'s okay for us to (raise and) kill animals in order to eat them? In this world, the strong are the predators, and the weak are the preys. The strong steal all and win all, the weak get stolen from and lose all. That\\'s just how this rotten world (in reality) works. The anime delves into the \"strength\" of humans vs the titans. Escaping everyday routine has been a theme in many famous stories, such as \"The Dubliners\" (read it, very famous). How can a person live when doing the same thing over... and over... and over everyday. How would you feel if you were confined within a small amount of space and never allowed to go outside of that tiny space because you would get eaten mercilessly by a predator out there?\\n\\nThe art and sound in the anime is absolutely spectacular. The soundtrack of Shingeki no Kyojin, composed by Hiruko Sawano is (insert the greatest positive word you can think of). The openings were absolutely incredible as well, and I\\'m sure that everyone, whether or not you\\'ve seen the anime has heard of and fairly enjoyed/absolutely loved the opening, \"Guren Yumiya\". I believe it\\'s the most famous anime song ever. The art is fairly nicely drawn up, and the drawn up 3D maneuver gear certainly was well made. I must say in terms of visuals, the titans were drawn up to perfection! Their faces are disgustingly disfigured and what is up their skin/teeth! They look creepy as fuck, which is great! As for the characters, each person was fairly well drawn up... Although I wouldn\\'t say great! and the horses/skies/plains (nature) was absolutely beautiful and realistically drawn. I must mention that the freedom of wing capes were quite desirable, very cool capes/art.\\n\\nEren is anything but a traditional protagonist. While a typical hero is driven by a great sense of morality, honor, pride, or a desire to make the world a better place for everyone’s sake and not just their own, Eren takes every stereotype and crushes it. Having lost his mother to Titian, monsters that he already despised to begin with, Eren’s motivation to join the military and eradicate the Titans are based purely on his bloodthirsty need for revenge, not his desire to improve the world. While it is true that he has expressed that he wants to see the world outside the walls, he didn’t really show initiative (his crazy hatred) until his mother died (although he did plan on joining the recon corps).Perhaps my favorite trait of Eren is that, even though he’s the main protagonist, he is pretty weak as a fighter. That is a quality that makes Eren very real. He’s not an overpowered main character; he’s human. He has powers, but his powers are pretty much the only reason he’s still alive. He’s not some kind of god, and he’s far from invincible. He’s, at the core, just a very angry boy that has lost his mother and wants to avenge her, and he does so with an unbreakable spirit. \\n\\nAs for Mikasa Ackerman, she is a quiet and withdrawn girl and maintains a near constant stoic expression, except when Eren is in danger. Mikasa\\'s attachment to Eren may or not not go beyond feelings of siblings (well, she is adopted). Mikasa is one of those characters that people will love because first off she\\'s beautiful, secondly she\\'s funny and somewhat kind and mean at the same time, and to top it off, and last not but least she\\'s the concrete definition of badass (kicks some Titan ass).\\n\\nLast but not least our 3rd main character Armin Arlert, a cowardly smart boy who possesses a sharp mind and a natural intuition for strategy which has proven useful on many occasions. Armin Arlert is a character that some will hate for his cowardice and \"no fightingness\" but others will like because he actually uses his brain, and you have to feel bad for him for being so very human (fear). \\n\\nWhy did I present dragging info on the characters? Because, their charactistics all add so much to the anime. All the other characters in Shingeki no Kyojin are quite likeable, it\\'s just a shame that a lot of them will die out one by one before your eyes. And of course, I will have to mention Levi because he\\'s obviously the most popular character in Shingeki no Kyojin. Why? Well because first of all, he\\'s smart, secondly he\\'s always composed, thirdly he kicks everyones ass, both humans and titans, fourthly he wants to protect people and is in a way a \"jesus\" figure to mankind, and lastly and most importantly, his fetish for always cleaning makes him a hilarious character.  \\n\\nEven though the whole concept of naked giants devouring humans sounds a little weird at first, the main idea behind it (that is, humans not being on top of the food chain anymore) is pretty well done and the plot grows into an epic adventure that you would regret not watching. Overall the anime is very enjoyable and although some people may call it overrated (it can\\'t be everyone\\'s favorite anime...) I will tell you that you\\'d regret not watching it for sure. Epic is written all over the anime.\\n\\nConclusion: I guess it\\'s a bit overrated considering it could become the most popular anime of all time, but it\\'s certainly not as bad as a lot of haters claim it is. I guess the hate can\\'t be helped though since with popularity and greatness comes hate. But, people can have different perspectives on things, that\\'s what makes humans so great right? That concludes my review, thanks for reading!~',\n",
       " \"It pains me in a way to not give Attack on Titan anything but a 10. I completely understand why this show got so popular so fast. I also understand why everybody is impatiently waiting for season 2. I want to say that it is really as flawless as people say it is. But I can't. While I would genuinely recommend this show, I am still a critic. I still have to acknowledge that this show has problems. As good as this show is, and it is very, very good, I cannot with a good conscience say that it does not have glaring flaws. The biggest isthe simple fact that this show has too much talk. I know that dialogue is crucial to telling a story and developing character, but there is a time and a place for it. There were several occasions where they have a really good story coming up in what should be the very next episode, but the show digs its heels into the ground and spends an entire episode talking about what was coming. It just seems like whenever this show can build up momentum, it feels the need to deploy the drag chute. This show is not nearly fast-paced enough. But this problem also appears within the action. There are so many five minute long conversations, or inner monologues, or flashback sessions smack in the middle of an action scene. The pacing of this show seriously needs work.\\nThankfully, the good aspects of this show trump the bad ones hundredfold. The action is incredible, the art is distinctive, and the voice acting is some of the best that I have ever seen. Is it perfect? Absolutely not. But it is by all means worth watching.\",\n",
       " 'This will be my first ever review on this website, and I figured it best to start with the one series most fresh in my mind. Attack on Titan was one of the most rewarding anime experiences I\\'ve ever had. Unique premise, serious characters and a vivid soundtrack and art style make the first season of this show one to remember. I will keep this review spoiler free, as to not ruin the experience for anyone else. Sometimes animes will fall into the trap of taking themselves too seriously. The main difference about AOT is that it deserves the afforementioned comment.Humanity is on the brink of extinction, being overrun by several meter tall human-like \"titans\" that terrorize and eat humans for just the pleasure of it.  Humankind has succumbed to building three giant walls to protect themselves against the giants, and all was safe and sound....until the first wall was breached by an abnormally gigantic Titan, allowing the smaller ones to get in and annihilate the city.  Eventually the invasion stopped, but the damage had already been done... The number of casualties was astronomical.  The story continues by following Eren Yeager, Mikasa Ackerman and Armin Arlert as they join the military in hopes of avenging the titan\\'s invasion and The death of Eren\\'s mother.  Throughout the series, their efforts are pivotal in regaining a stronghold in the apocalyptic world.\\n\\nOne thing I love and hate about this series is the character development.  It\\'s just so damn good.  At the same token, it occasionally feels so gut punching when a new character\\'s past is explained, and then they are soon after another casualty in the struggle to survive.  The amount of emotions that are invoked while one watches AOT are tremendous.  I often found myself speaking out loud during a characters close brush with death or laughing during one of Sasha\\'s hungry outbursts.  The story in itself is also unique.  I had been hearing wayyyy too many of the same plots floating around recently, so it was a breath of fresh air to experience AOT firsthand... At the recommendation of so many friends.  \\n\\nThe art style depicted in this series is also quite incredible.  Influences by Claymore and Casshern Sins are apparent, drawing from past experience of AOTs writer, Yasuko Kobayashi.  I love how dark and gritty the character models can be, and how vivid the backgrounds are drawn.  The music is also epic and fanfareish.  The 2 openings also represent the growth of the story and are both extremely catchy.\\n\\nIn a nutshell, AOT is an anime not to be missed by any fan, especially if you love action and greatly developed characters.  I can\\'t wait until the second season rolls our way soon.',\n",
       " 'What would happen if humanity was no longer on the top of the food chain? How would we adapt, and how would our perception of the world change? Tetsurō Araki came to answer these questions with the release of his latest series. It is a tale of tragedy and revenge; of uplifting hope and crushing sadness. A love letter to the struggle of humanity and its destructive nature. This is Attack On Titan. Setting: The exact location and time place of AOT is unknown, but based off of the clothing, architectural style and character names it is safe to say that theseries is located around Germany and takes place during the 17th century.  Humanity has locked itself away behind three impossibly tall walls named Maria, Rose and Sina.  After the outer most wall, Maria is assaulted and damaged titans flood in, starting our tale of woe.\\n\\nStory:\\nThe story of AOT is quite simple, but not in a bad way.  Yasuko Kobayashi (the anime writer) didn\\'t over complicate the plot with half baked symbolism or conspiracy pandering.  AOT knows exactly where it wants to go and doesn\\'t waste any time getting there.  Don\\'t get me wrong I\\'m not saying the series is dull, far from it actually; I just find it refreshing to watch a show that doesn\\'t spend the first half trying to convince about me how cool and artsy it is.  I knew exactly what I was getting, and AOT never changed that.  In addition to the narrative, the actual setting is wonderfully crafted.  While removed from reality AOT never strays to far from the believable.  Everything fits from a historical point of view; the powerful religious presence, the centralized political structure, the proper use of period weaponry.  The only problem with the story its pacing.  While fine for most the show it does tend to drag between episodes 10-15.  The show presents our characters with a simple task that takes them far too long to complete.          \\n\\nOn a side note I found a lot of similarities between AOT and the average mecha story line.  While AOT is leaps and bounds over most generic mechas I couldn\\'t help, but make some connections.  Angry new-comer discovers hidden robot (titan power), uses robot to avenge loved one, fights others with similar robots, gets butt whooped, gets stronger, defeats opponent, rinse and repeat.  I just thought it was an interesting notion.\\n\\nArt:\\nI\\'ll start off this section by saying that, for the most part, AOT was animated by a brand new studio with no other anime under its belt.  Studio Wit is a surrogate of the well know studio Production I.G.; so its member clearly have experience, but until AOT they had never worked directly on a project as a singular group.  So with this in mind it is literally astonishing how much quality this show has.  Seriously, if Attack On Titan were a fruit it would be dripping with the succulent juices of grandeur.  Most shows allocate their budgets to the most \"important\" parts of each episode, i.e. the action scenes.  In turn this causes most of the scenes involving dialogue and plot development to come off as unimportant and lack luster; when in reality these scene are just as, if not more, important than the ones involving action.  However, the animation for AOT never falters; each scene is given the same amount of care as the others.  In addition, this show has an air of excitement about it.  I could tell AOT was more than just another job to Studio Wit; they truly care about this series.\\n\\nNot only is the animation beautiful, the art style itself is brilliant.  The varying thicknesses of black borders around each character and object helps to add an increased field of depth during scenes of rapid movement.  This creates a sense of urgency whenever the characters use their 3DM/ODM gear, only maximizing the excitement the show puts off.  The art of AOT is perfect, literally.\\n\\nSound:\\nThe OST for Attack On Titan should be used as model to teach young composers about the necessary elements that make up a great soundtrack.  While not perfect, the OST hits every note it needs to, and then continues on to become even better than required.  Even though all the tracks are great in their own right; a few of them managed to reach the \"anime peak of greatness status\". Those would include the two openings of the series.  Which are easily up there with \"Cowboy Bebop\" and \"Baccano!\" (btw second opening is best....let the fighting ensue).  Sound design on the other hand sits right at the average mark.  Most of the sounds are over used, and were never that great to start.  So, after a while it can leave a bad taste in your mouth.  It works for what it is, but isn\\'t anything to write home about.\\n\\nAs the astute reader you are, I\\'m sure you have figured out that I will always watch the English dub if available.  So how is the Attack On Titan dub?  The best way to describe it would be unique.  I say that, because some of the voice actors Funimation picked require a certain taste.  For example, Bryce Papenbrook choose voice Eren in a very forceful manner.  It reminds me how most people sound when they smash their toe; jaw clinched with a slight growl in their voice.  Personally, I rather enjoyed the English dub, but I understand that I am in the minority of this one.  I would recommend to watch the first four episodes in dub, and decide where to go from there.\\n\\nCharacters:\\nIn the character department I would compare AOT to the critically acclaimed video game \"The Last Of Us\".  I understand that not everyone is a gamer as I am, but just bare with me here.  The characters in both of these are as unoriginal as they come.  However, they weave such a unique story and have such interesting development, that in turn, they become fresh and a great enjoyment to watch.  Some of the development is a bit rushed at times, but it always comes from a natural progression and doesn\\'t feel forced in the slightest.  As any anime junkie would know, that is an accomplishment on its own; especially in this sea of generic rom-coms and forced love triangles.  My main complaint is the lack of development for side characters.  Some get their deserved screen time, but others only receive some kind of goofy quirk as to be memorable without actually accomplishing anything.  We have potato girl (Sasha), bald dude (Connie) and freckles kid (Marco).  I want to know their stories and what kind of people they are beyond their stereotypical traits.\\n\\nPersonal Enjoyment/Overall:\\nAll flaws aside, Attack On Titan is one of the most entertaining shows I ever had the pleasure of watching; I can\\'t wait of season 2 to be released.  The action is exciting, the story is tense and the animation is beautiful.  I give it a rating of Must Watch on my scale of recommendation.\\n\\nMasterpiece-Best\\nMust Watch\\nWatch\\nTry The First Couple Episodes\\nSkip It\\nRun For Your Life-Worst \\n\\nAs usual I recommend you buy a copy, and help support our local dubbing companies and the anime industry as a whole.  However, just taking the time to watch it is of greater importance.\\nAs a final statement I recommend that you take my numerical scores with a grain of salt; as numerical scores are easily skewed and each person has their own understanding of the 1-10 scale.',\n",
       " 'If there was ever an anime experience that would leave you needing therapy, marathon-watching Shingeki no Kyojin is it. Perhaps this is the best way to watch this series; by the end, you\\'d be so emotionally exhausted and mangled, you\\'ll know what total despair is like. Not since Berserk have I seen an anime capable of utterly destroying... hope. Yet in spite of its soul-crushing hopelessness, Shingeki no Kyojin is entirely about hope. Without it, mankind would have nothing. In this world, giants roam the land. These \"titans\" (as it\\'s been anglicised) prey on human beings. They are brutal, violent and unstoppable. Their arrival is asmysterious as their motives. They do not eat to live. They do not eat anything else. They consume human beings and vomit them out. Humans have become worse than livestock on the food chain. At least sheep or cows are eaten for a reason. There is no discernible purpose for why the titans eat humans. They just do, and living with this fear and confusion behind the giant walls of the last known stronghold is the dwindled population of all of humanity. They\\'ve been able to keep the titans out for over a hundred years. Life in a cage, but life nonetheless.\\n\\nShingeki no Kyojin begins with the protagonist Eren Jaeger questioning whether this kind of life is worth it. Freedom does not mean breathing boxed in, awaiting death. That\\'s not life and he vows to use whatever power he has to fight the titans. With him is Mikasa, a girl adopted by his family, and his friend Armin. While Eren is strong-willed and rash, Mikasa is calculated and fierce and Armin is thoughtful and soft-hearted; the trio play off one another\\'s strengths and weaknesses in order to survive. And this anime becomes a war for survival.\\n\\nEren makes for a dependable protagonist. He carries the series well, despite having some \"shounen hero\" tendencies but perhaps his enthusiasm is necessary in a world where people drop their swords and flee in the face of danger or who opt to police within the safe walls of the rich inner cities. However, Mikasa is probably the show\\'s great hero. Powerful, naturally gifted and determined, she carries Eren whenever he falls. As he is her only family, she is terribly protective of him. She lives entirely for him, and this may seem to be the only detriment to her character, but her loyalty to him is understandable when you learn of their past. Armin will be nobody\\'s favourite off the bat. Wimpy, small and unable to fight, he has developed his intellect instead. The other characters are well-crafted and have distinct personalities (though they are just as many \"Who\\'s that again?\" ones as well). Some of the stand-outs are Levi, a very short, extremely experienced and talented captain, Sasha, a girl who seems to gladly choose getting punched in the face by her superiors if it means she can get a potato, Annie, who like Mikasa is very strong and capable, and Jean, a spoiled and cowardly soldier who eventually becomes someone whose growth you can possibly be proud of. It\\'s easy to like them... but maybe it\\'s not entirely wise.\\n\\nOne of Shingeki no Kyojin\\'s characteristics is that nothing and nobody is safe. It is not afraid of itself. It does not shy away from brutalising its audience or characters because honestly, this is a horrible place and time to be alive. It constantly reminds you of human mortality and fragility. Some people might tell you \"don\\'t get attached to anyone\". Sound advice, but you won\\'t take it. The characters in this series are constructed so well that you will root for them as they pick up their swords and then cry out in disbelieving grief as you see them crushed like a mosquito. Blood and then silence. It\\'s not entirely right to say \"nobody is safe\" as plot-immortality applies to certain characters and that is quite evident. Although the anime is going to make you doubt yourself.\\n\\nGone are the anime physics where someone can go flying into a wall and can get up without a scratch. If someone flies into a wall in this anime, that\\'s it. Game over, man. Game over. This is no anime for children; it is a complete bloodbath. It is not afraid to show you crushed limbs, torn-away faces, stinking, steaming bones, people\\'s necks being snapped like chickens. It doesn\\'t shy away from letting you hear screams of people facing their last moment on earth.\\n\\nBut it\\'s not the violence alone that will sock you hard ones to the stomach -- it\\'s the story itself. The concepts behind what is presented and also actual events will have you reeling. The second arc of this anime more or less will have you screaming \"NO, IT CAN\\'T BE\". Because you simply don\\'t want to believe what you\\'re seeing or who it involves. The entire series will have you holding your head wondering what is going on. The characters themselves don\\'t really know, and you share that confusion with them. Shingeki no Kyojin\\'s story is by far one of the most creative and well-crafted in modern anime history. It has the right tone, focus and content. It develops surprisingly at every turn. This is an anime you cannot necessarily lay out a trajectory for in terms of what is going to happen. You take every episode like it is tomorrow -- you ultimately cannot know what can or will happen.\\n\\nVisually, it boasts some finely animated fight scenes, especially when the soldiers use their gear to go \"flying\" through the city. This gear is pretty inventive and can be likened to Spider-Man\\'s web-slinging. The soldiers train to be agile and precise using this gear as it catapults them through the air. The best users of this know how to manoeuvre throughout a city block, across a titan\\'s back or across the sky as though it were their first nature. The animation makes sure to keep you on your toes during action scenes, angling shots to keep momentum or knowing just how close to do a close-up for the best effect. The dark lines and general colourlessness of the art style keeps with the tone of the overall series. However, you can see where budgetary shortcuts were had, and while nothing to deter from the series, it is not quite perfect. Music-wise, the sound builds on the horror and the dramatic tension, and while some tracks are certainly recognisable as you watch on, they aren\\'t entirely memorable.\\n\\nShingeki no Kyojin is all about experiencing it. You can have time later to think about what\\'s happening or to theorise, but there is no time for that in the midst of watching. There are only held breaths, churning stomachs, wide eyes and feelings of absolute horror. There are times when humanity seems to be getting somewhere, where you think, okay, there\\'s a chance now. Hope. It exists somewhere, as small as it might be, hidden in the depths of crushing losses and corpses and city rubble. It\\'s there, and that\\'s what Eren and his friends will give their lives to find.',\n",
       " \"Attack on Titan is one of the manga turned to anime on recent period. It is an Action anime with focus on tragedy and very dark tone, yet maintaining some Shonen-esque messages such as trust and overcoming fears.

There is also much lore in the world to keep creative fans making fanworks and adaptions of the world of Attack on Titan. The thrill element is very high and makes you eager to see what's next. Keep in mindthis anime covers only a portion of the manga and stops at the end of an arc.

       " 'During that adrenaline rush stage of viewing fast, heavy-hitting content, we tend to lose all train of thought for the pixelated images flooding our screen. We are blindsided by the idea of what could happen next. Our brain racing to process new information as the stakes of any given set-piece is further compounded. When boiled down to its essentials, this rapid succession of quick build up and an immediate payoff is the cornerstone for many successful action titles. That \"rush,\" that moment, is the pleasures we seek out in them; the very thing that makes the action genre so appealing, to begin with. It\\'s forthat reason that they remain significant breadwinners across many storytelling mediums. Once we\\'re locked in and find ourselves immersed in the experience, everything else becomes secondary. Who has time to question the practicality of James Bond dispatching henchmen on top a speeding bullet train when we could just sit back and enjoy the spectacle? No one does, that\\'s who! We\\'re too busy living in the moment-to-moment rush to be bothered with any other details. So understandably, this can cause a false sense of judgment when trying to gauge the subject matter\\'s level of quality control. It\\'s easy to buy into the absurdity of any given situation when you\\'re caught up in the middle of it. Thematically, you may just be consuming something that\\'s 90% hot hair and 10% gray matter, but God be damned if that isn\\'t the best 10% mass of gray matter you\\'ve ever consumed! \\n\\nBut what happens when we do bother to give ourselves a moment to question it? When all those problematic aspects that we once shoved to the wayside has now been given time to be mulled over? All of a sudden, an immersive experience can become questionable to what was there all along. As we settle down and pull ourselves out of the situation, that excitement once offered by that clump of gray mass has now been slowly revealed for what it truly was all along. We pull back slowly to see the bigger picture, to see the 90% that we ignored; and to our surprises, there it is, the puckered out rear-end of the elephant in the room. Rationality kicks in and the spell that was once hanging over our heads have now been broken. For better or for worse, our blind appraisal has now dialed back to something more rational. The enjoyment that the content offered us may still remain intact, but our assessment of it have changed accordingly. This discernment comes as a result of separating individual enjoyment from that of impartial analysis—or as we regular folks like to call it—\"using common sense.\" We shift from living in the moment to retroactively assimilating the moment. Basically, we as viewers begin to establish our own form of quality-control standards, in more words or less; an act that\\'s too often mistaken as \"hating on something\" when in actuality, it\\'s quite the opposite. It\\'s the act of fully appreciating and digesting the content, for both its good and bad attributes, instead of pretending those attributes don\\'t coexist in the same body of work.   \\n\\nIgnorance may be bliss, but a proper understanding of the content you consume is true satisfaction.\\n\\nToday, we\\'ll attempt to do just that with Shingeki no Kyojin (Attack on Titan), as we snap out our trances, wipe the drool off our faces, and take a step back to view the elephant, or in this case, the clumsy naked giant in the room. And by doing so, we\\'ll aim to comprehend what\\'s become one of the most popular anime titles of all time.\\n\\nWhether you adore or loathe it, Attack on Titan\\'s prominence in the 2010s has made it an ambassador for anime-related content, both in and out of the anime community. And really, it\\'s not hard to see why. It\\'s a show that presented itself as a typical shounen product, but when viewed, comes gift-wrapped in the aesthetic sensibilities of a hardcore, grindhouse seinen feature. The equivalent of which is like parents taking their 10-year old kid to watch 2010\\'s Kick-Ass or Super under the presumption that \"it\\'s just another Marvel family-friendly superhero film,\" only to be greeted with the grim reality that it\\'s anything but. Their newly found realization of this fact coming in the form of bloody entrails being sprayed across the movie screen like celebratory confetti; a consolation prize offered up by the director for getting their assumptions wrong. \\n\\nKeeping that in mind, Attack on Titan\\'s marketing strategy was nothing short of a stroke of genius. In its 1st episode—where the falsehood of stability within a medieval town was instantly flipped on its head—an act that\\'s commenced by a stampede of carnivorous giants tearing citizens apart in the most gruesome fashion possible; the anime community collectively \"lost their shit.\" Seemingly overnight, viewing the show became something like a cultural event. As the selling point given to the uninitiated went something along the lines of \"just wait for the twist bro!\" An organic marketing tactic driven by word of mouth was born, the likes of which eventually led to it being in the top 5 most viewed anime titles, on all, if not most anime-database websites by the time the final episode aired. And now, after a few years have passed to see the effects of it in retrospect, it turns out we were witnessing the birth of a new gateway title in the making, as the show became an outsider window into the anime medium and how it falls into the current pop culture landscape at large. All of a sudden, there was a renewed interest for the Japanese import, made all the more obvious when you consider the growing number of companies that are trying to tap into the potentially lucrative market that might present itself to those willing to unearth it. A cultural bubble that\\'s been steadily flowing beneath the business world\\'s feet since the late 80s but with a modern-day face finally being attached, making exhuming it for profit easier than ever. This was no longer \"our thing\" fellow members of the anime community, this was now on its way to becoming a marketable sub-culture once again, thanks in large part to titles like AoT bringing back visibility to the medium, with its tentpole pitched high for all to see. \\n\\nThis slight removal of fan ownership may have led to the first noticeable wave of backlash for the show. The delicate bruised egos of long-time anime fans that don\\'t want \"their thing\" being associated with the loud, brutish thrashing of AoT\\'s typical portrayal. And honestly, it might stand to be the most superficial reason to dislike any piece of media as well. Anime as a medium doesn\\'t get to decide what face it will wear in the public\\'s eye, in the same way, no honest-to-God movie-buff like the face of their past-time being represented by any bloated Hollywood remake of a beloved classic. \\n\\nPopular media, whether that be for music, movies, TV shows or books, are usually represented by the loudest, most accessible examples of their respective medium. Their credibility in these cases is usually secondary to their marketability. So whether you like or dislike the show, just make sure you\\'re not doing so under the pretext of its popularity, because at that point, whatever you have to say will just fall on deaf ears, as this discernment of media is a very rudimentary fact that should be understood by most. With that being said, in an effort to get ahead of the inevitable shit show that accompanies the discussion of any popular anime, let me make my stance on the matter very clear: I LOVE Attack on Titan like a fat boy loves cake. As of the time of this writing, it\\'s on my \"top 100\" favorite anime titles, while far more critically acclaimed works don\\'t even make the final cut. It may not be seen as a substantive viewing experience, but let\\'s face it, we all need our comfort food, and in the case of AoT, it\\'s the show that serves that role for me—it\\'s my McDonalds. \\n\\nI see no reason to bastardize the title for its inherent mainstream appeal. That\\'s just how it is. Any criticism or appraisal I will offer towards it from here on out will be based on what it had to offer and NOT the role projected onto it by outside forces. A true critical evaluation of anything, (favorites included), comes with the acknowledgment of both its strengths and weaknesses, not from pretending a work is lacking in either attribute. Now with that long-winded precursor out of the way, let\\'s get on with the review. \\n\\nThe first and perhaps most prominent feature of AoT was its audiovisual output. It may not seem like it today, with the advent of consistently grander looking animated productions, but at the time of AoT\\'s release, the show was seen as a high watermark for televised animated works. Alongside titles like 2011\\'s Fate/Zero, AoT\\'s visual presentation output took on, what was seen at that time, as the kind of attention to detail that was only afforded to animated movies. Before face-palming terms like \"sakuga\" was widely popularized for describing well-animated sequences for anime series, it was usually narrowed down to just a handful of moments throughout a show\\'s run-time. With the rise of the aforementioned titles, that thought process changed, as well-animated sequences were dispersed throughout the entire runtime, at what seemed to be random intervals, as opposed to before where such efforts were reserved on the basis of selling some penultimate climactic act. Now, seemingly out of nowhere, moments that truly didn\\'t need any extra flair was also getting the same attention-to-detail that would usually be reserved for the first and last episode of any other show. Whether you care to admit it or not, AoT\\'s massive success played its part in paving the way for more flair in directing and presentation in anime shows to follow. But where titles like Fate/Zero only found popularity in the anime community\\'s upper echelons, AoT went on to find even greater success, becoming a household name for even those unfamiliar with the anime culture altogether. \\n\\nThe art and animation were simply boundary-pushing. For the first time in a long time, fluidity wasn\\'t treated as a secondary concern. Layered textures and shading weren\\'t placed on limited supply. Choreography wasn\\'t immediately reduced to speed-lines and the infamous \"cut to black\" shots to insinuate movement. Backgrounds weren\\'t just scene-placeholders to avoid figuring out the topography of the land in order to give locations a sense of existence. Wonky character models weren\\'t just accepted as a byproduct of \"because of the budget.\" AoT proved that there was a better standard worth aiming for. And no, I\\'m not saying these techniques or shortcomings weren\\'t found in AoT, they certainly were, but the degree to which the show relied on these techniques to avoid having to extensively animate, direct, or compose scenes, were significantly less, while at the same time, having a noticeable increase in favorable choices usually thought of as rare exceptions. \\n\\nThe bombastic orchestral musical selection, cleanly rendered 3D animation, well-choreographed action scenes, great use of cinematography, anatomically precise character movement, directing tricks usually reserved for live-action films; all of this and more made it an immediate hit with viewers. \\n\\nIt was grand, dare I say it, even \"epic.\" A sense of scale that felt absent in too many shows at the time. Where most action-orientated anime settled for locations that didn\\'t amount to anything but battlefield backdrops, AoT tapped into a storytelling fundamental that the shounen genre all but abandoned: worldbuilding. This may not seem all that significant for a seasoned viewer that bothers to forage through the entries of yesteryear, but for the less-experienced viewer who\\'ve only accustomed themselves to the drab landscape offered up by a limited selection of underbaked locations usually presented by this genre; effectively, what AoT did was stimulate an interest that many viewers didn\\'t realize they were yearning for. An interest that makes the biggest difference between memorable or forgettable stories. This creative decision was perhaps the biggest reason owed towards the show\\'s continued success beyond its audiovisual marketing.\\n\\nBut before we could dive into how cool those Spiderman-like web-slinging city-dive shots were or what it meant for the action scenes, we must first examine the massive undertaking that the creators dedicated towards AoT\\'s worldbuilding that made all of it possible. \\n\\nIt\\'s no coincidence that the show effectively opens up by introducing us to the walled-off city and the architectural structures of the buildings inside. Or better yet, the scale of these structures when pitted against the monstrous threat that inhabits this world. All of this was done to help start the process of setting the stage. Something the anime will continuously do throughout its run. You see, proper worldbuilding doesn\\'t just stop with establishing shots, it\\'s something that\\'s supposed to expand alongside the story to help accommodate the content placed in it. And in the case of AoT, that means a whole lot of inventive action, intriguing locations, and tactile environments that feel every bit as convincing to anything found in the real world. \\n\\nFrom the title cards inserted at the halfway point to the medieval-inspired European houses, there\\'s not a moment where the show isn\\'t making the viewer privy to new world details, visual landmarks, and macroeconomic world functions. It cultivated a lived-in world for its inhabitants by reinforcing the means of living, the area layout of its civilians, even things that may be perceived as trivial, like the functionality of the weapons that the military uses. You see, in order for things to feel important, you must first give the viewer a sense of existence in the world, to be able to grasp what\\'s at stake for those within it. So later on, when this once considered \"useless\" knowledge festers in the back of the viewer\\'s mind — seeing the limitations of citizen mobility, the seemingly endless maze of alleyways, and the sense of hopelessness experienced by humanity when cornered by the evil forces out to get them — all of a sudden, the viewer is now standing there with them and not simply on the outside looking in. \\n\\nMany action movies like 2006\\'s Casino Royale or 2008\\'s Taken don\\'t have to worry about most of this because its world and locations are already accepted as is; this is the true advantage of live-action. This is why James Bond and his antics have very little hurdles to cross to make the audience accept what\\'s going on because the world they\\'re placed in is our own world. It\\'s \"real.\" AoT, and similarly any animated feature, isn\\'t alotted that immediate acceptance, something that\\'s often taken for granted. If the world isn\\'t thought out, it\\'s hard to get enveloped in it. So when you\\'re running your fingers across the rough surface of a moss-covered stone, creeping through the back streets occupied by the dilapidated housing of the common people; their homes built up by lumber that\\'s slightly weathered by decay; contrasted by the sturdy, clutter-free appearance of the religious facility, with its towering structure shooting up over the houses dwarfed below. Or simply lying under a tree, as the grass and blue wildflowers surrounding you are rustled by the breeze, the endless stretch of Wall Maria looming in the background, registering no comment from the citizens, as they accept it just as much as you accept the Pyramids or Eiffel Tower as real-life landmarks; you\\'re getting a firsthand experience of all of this worldbuilding detail at play. You may not be aware of it, but somewhere in your subconscious, these registered efforts are sinking in. \\n\\nRegardless of what tonal issues the show may have towards the interaction of its world —  and trust me, there are some serious issues — the actual worldbuilding itself is pretty solid.\\n\\nBut enough talk about the important things in the background that makes this all work, let\\'s discuss the fun shit that everyone could comprehend; those awesome ass Spiderman-like, web-slinging city-dive shots! Tetsurou Araki, the madman behind this stroke of directorial genius, is no stranger to over-heightened, summer blockbuster-style action. Before AoT, he gave us the most unnecessarily intense, borderline comical potato chip eating scene in Death Note; the physics-defying Matrix boobs bullet-time effects of High School of the Dead; and who could forget, the booty-shorts wearing, boat-hopping leapfrog shoot-out scene from episode 3 of Black Lagoon. When it comes to directing the hell out of an action scene, regardless of how ridiculous the final outcome may be, very few come close to Araki. He\\'s basically the self-aware version of Michael Bay/Zach Synder for anime. \\n\\nBut there\\'s a lot more that goes into making these action scenes work. For one, Araki seemed to have a good grasp on capturing field-of-depth by allowing the foreground and background enough space to properly breathe. Without that discernment, the show could have easily become a muddled mess of incomprehensible motion (think most shaky-cam scenes for action movies). Where it could have turned into a nauseating rollercoaster ride of unnecessary directing techniques, Araki was able to demonstrate restraint when the scene called for it. Which may seem like an odd thing to say with a show that quite literally has people flying across cities and giant naked people trying to eat them. \\n\\nAnother aspect that helped give the action scenes staying power was the sheer amount of diversity given to not only the battle locations but also the titans themselves. From the claustrophobic feeling given off by the town environment to the woodland dominated by towering trees, every battlefield is given careful consideration for the fighting forces of humanity and the titans they come against. \\n\\nBut what good is all of this appraisal of the show\\'s action scenes without addressing the second biggest highlight: the music. \"Heavy-hitting\" is possibly the best way to quickly describe what the music selection here has to offer. Like Araki, who\\'s reputable track record has brought him fame and appraisal within the anime industry, so too is the case for the man behind the music of AoT, Hiroyuki Sawano. Sawano\\'s musical style can best be described as a mixture of orchestral and electronic. By blending the traditional with that of contemporary music, he\\'s able to give a feeling of timeless familiarity, while simultaneously retrofitting it for a modern audience. With booming brass instruments starting off the charge, primal drums flowing in the undercurrent like a steady heartbeat, the crooning of an incoming choir ascending from the center, and string sections that cascade into the mix with a signature snare; this soundtrack elevates the anime like a shot of pure adrenaline! Riling up the viewer for the events to come. \\n\\nThere\\'s a wonderful symbiotic relationship shared between the audio and visual department of AoT; the kind of dance between elements that\\'s rarely ever this unified. Given Sawano\\'s work on Mobile Suit Gundam Unicorn, Guilty Crown and several other projects before getting involved with AoT, the vetting process was far behind him. What we got, as a result, was someone comfortable with his craft. A kind of swagger only obtainable by true experience.\\n\\nWith the directing of Araki at the helm, Sawano\\'s musical prowess propelling it even further, and the efforts of every other crew member involved, the end result was a type of synchronicity that felt every bit as planned as it did coincidental gatherings of the right people for the job. Sawano\\'s sense of auditory dramatics melded perfectly with Araki\\'s pension for high-octane content, both of which lend itself perfectly to Hajime\\'s writing style that focuses on melodrama and theatrics. What we have on display here was a perfect storm of individual thinkers all working towards the same core sentiments. And while that flare for the dramatic may have worked in the favor of most of what was presented, in some aspects, the outcome was a bit... juvenile. \\n\\nWhich brings me to a presentation decision that may have served as the first point of contention for most viewers of the show: the hammy, over-the-top voice-acting. \\n\\nThe screenplay for this anime seemed to have been composed entirely of capital letters and exclamation marks. It\\'s the kind of absurd overacting that someone like Nicolas Cage might employ on one of his many B-movie escapades. But here, it\\'s played without the slightest hint of sarcasm. And while I found this to be an amusing attribute, and honestly another reason why I enjoyed AoT, given my soft spot for schlock/B-grade content. For most not acclimated into that realm of entertainment, scoffing at these performances may be an involuntary reaction. And for those that do find this annoying, I completely understand. \\n\\nThe general approach taken went something along the lines of this:\\n\\n-Any other anime: \"Let\\'s come up with a plan to get out of this situation.\"\\n         V.S\\n-Attack on Titan: \"OMFG BRO, LIKE WTF, WE NEED TO GET OUT OF HERE!!! LET\\'S THINK OF SOMETHING WHILE SCREAMING AT THE TOP OF OUR LUNGS, EVEN IF WE\\'RE SURROUNDED BY TITANS AND TRYING NOT TO DRAW ATTENTION TO OURSELVES AT THE MOMENT!!!! OK!?!??!\"\\n\\nI wish I was being hyperbolic here, but this is what AoT does on constant repeat. The concept of \"inside voices\" was completely lost in this universe. So while I may laugh hysterically at the sheer madness of the voice actors seemingly being prompted to \"unleash their inner crackhead,\" I\\'m in no way condoning this as some positive aspect. \\n\\nAnd since we\\'re addressing the issues of AoT at this point, I guess it\\'s time we address the clumsy naked giants in the room: the story and characters.\\n\\nFor every appraisal I\\'ve lobbied at AoT for its worldbuilding, the same number of issues can be found with the story that takes place in it. In the process of picking up the ball dropped by many other shounens, AoT accidentally tossed the story down a flight of stairs, where it seemingly suffered a concussion on its long way down. AoT\\'s story was plagued with several issues, one of which may perhaps be one of the worst kinds of narrative conceits: the mystery box. And what I mean by that is that you\\'re watching 25 episodes of \"stuff\" happen, but nowhere is there a conclusion, or better yet, a sense of purpose or finality to any of it. Cohesiveness is missing, instead, what we have is a series of \"and then\" plotting choices, as is usually the symptom of anything relying on the mystery box appeal to sell its feature. \\n\\nIf you\\'re reading this, you\\'ve either seen AoT or heard enough about it to understand the general idea, so I won\\'t waste my time regurgitating information you could simply find in a synopsis. What we will discuss, however, are the ways these narrative decisions ended up hurting the show. And if that means exposing the number of calories in my unhealthy comfort food as a result, so be it. \\n\\nAoT is erratic. Having nothing to truly say or no insurmountable goal it\\'s trying to get to means that it could, and did, become one hell of a journey. When your story becomes akin to an unpredictable roller coaster ride of happenings, all to reach an elusive mystery that\\'s ill-defined, yet naked to all those paying attention to it; the sheer level of sensationalized theatrics that the creators could tap into is bound only by their ability to imagine it. This, as a result, ensured that every episode of AoT was marked off with a huge cliffhanger. It basically became voluntary visual entropy. Like the genius behind its organic viral marketing, this scatterbrained approach to \"just go with it\" storytelling, under the guise of knowing what exactly you\\'re doing, ended up creating some truly spectacular firework displays. It worked in the past for live-action TV shows like Lost, is currently the reason that One Piece can span onward for eons, and will be the reason that AoT will carry that baton into the future.\\n\\nSuccess in the eyes of the business world breathes this dilemma: make a true-to-self statement or appease others for personal benefit. You could try to have it both, but that\\'s a goal rarely obtainable; compromise is almost inevitable. If this wasn\\'t apparent enough, AoT\\'s creator, Hajime Isayama, has also gone on record many times admitting to several changes he\\'s made to his original idea for the material, all of which correlate with the reaction given by outside forces. This wasn\\'t done out of an artistic effort to give the \"true\" experience he envisioned, but simply because the studio heads and newfound fanbase surrounding the project started yelling \"we need more!\"\\n It\\'s this same kind of push for more, regardless of what it means to the original vision, that was expressed out loud from the likes of Kazuhiko Torishima of Dragon Ball fame, where he openly stated in an interview that \"-it should’ve been wrapped up with the Frieza Saga.” but cited the commonly expressed truth that when something becomes so big and popular, at some point, your vision becomes much more than simply \"your thing.\" Eventually, everyone takes selfish ownership. In the public domain, self-entitlement is an ugly beast that\\'s yet to be tamed. Hundreds of episodes later, and clearly \"ending it at Frieza saga\" wasn\\'t the case. \\n\"George Lucas is selfish because he won\\'t give the public distribution rights for the original Star Wars screening. Marvel \"sold out\" because they gave up their movie rights to The Mouse.\" — there\\'s really no winning this argument either way. The power of the dollar trumps all. The power of demanding fans trumps all. And sometimes, that also includes artistic integrity. AoT became another statistic. \\n\\nBut now we\\'re starting to enter a morbid place, so let\\'s get back to that fun shit! Time to address one of AoT\\'s most talked about features: the shock and awe of its excessive violence. \\n\\nThe violence is the feature that links the \"characters\" to the story. I use the term \"characters\" loosely, as its mostly just a wide range of stock-piled cannon fodder; where only being characterized enough to only get a cast mention would be the equivalent of a death sentence. And I\\'m not talking about any beautiful send-off, as the music slowly swells into a crescendo, I\\'m talking some really heinous shit! You don\\'t just \"die\" in Attack on Titan, you are torn limb from limb! You become the center attraction of abject horror! By the time one of these \"characters\" leave this earth, their arm is stuck somewhere ontop a rooftop, while their torso is halfway down the throat of a naked giant with down-syndrome eyes, munching down without a care in the world. AoT is high caliber schlock. Schlock that transcends to the upper echelons of Tarantino blood-splatter. Schlock that rides the coattails of exploitative media. Cannibal Holocaust would be proud.\\n\\nIt\\'s honestly one of my favorite aspects of the show, but let\\'s just be clear, being a favorite aspect doesn\\'t mean it\\'s a good one. This is my McDonalds after all, let\\'s not forget that. You see, the problem with reducing your \"characters\" into a Russian Roulette spin of \"what person can we brutally kill next?\" is that it divides them into two exacerbated sides: \\n\\n1.) plot armored to gross extremes \\n2.) expendable to gross extremes. \\n\\nWhen main characters are shown surviving death-flag incidents against all odds, despite what the universe shows you about said chances for other characters involved, it renders their upward mobility to success charitable. Even contrived at times. The screenwriter\\'s pen begins to leave creases into the product. There\\'s a clear line made, as clear as their heavy marker-like character outlines. And once you notice who\\'s in the safe zone, it\\'s hard to unsee it. It becomes a blemish for those taking the show seriously. Me, not so much, I knew my McDonalds wasn\\'t nutritional from the moment I purchased it. But for the ones who bought the snake oil, expecting more, that absence of care would be frustrating, to say the least. \\n\\nAnd on the opposite side of the creased-outline, we have the fodder. People who are made solely for their eventual deaths. It\\'s like watching people lined up before a gun firing squad. You start remembering them for how they died rather than who they were. They become a part of the blood splattered decoration, their remains paint the walls, the rest, a pile of bodily fluid, covered in stomach acid, left out in the sun to bake, (Did I mention that the deaths were gruesome?) In all seriousness though, AoT\\'s characters are not good in the slightest. They\\'re there to facilitate either cool fight scenes or cool death scenes; there\\'s really no in-between. \\n\\nAnd when death becomes a party trick and character success a hand-out, the tension, the stakes, everything, suddenly means so little. \\n\\nI love AoT, but at no point can I take it seriously, because it\\'s a show that\\'s shown me time and time again that it doesn\\'t even care about itself enough beyond spectacle. For AoT, integrity is a secondhand concept to theatrics. It\\'s schlock entertainment with an A-Grade budget, an as such, some of the best in the medium. But that\\'s where the appraisal begins and ends. Because when the momentary high is over, when I recline back in my couch, settle in, swallow the last bite of that comfort food, my stomach immediately growls and I find myself on the porcelain throne, purging that \"good-time\" out with projectile accuracy, while simultaneously dispensing a can of Febreeze, creating an artificial cloud to cover my nostrils. \\n\\nAnd you know what\\'s the fucked up part? I\\'m sure I\\'ll still be coming back to have second helpings. There\\'s more to life than veggies, we all need our comfort food, whether we choose to openly admit it, or shamefully hide behind terms like \"guilty pleasure.\" So go ahead, bite into your BigMac and do it without shame, because I\\'ll be the last person to ever cast judgment.',\n",
       " 'How does one review an entity such as Attack on Titan? It has gathered a massive following had has taken the anime community by storm. Anyone who calls themselves an anime fan has undoubtedly heard of the show and even those who aren\\'t anime fans probably have seen some kind of merchandise floating around wore by someone... someone like me who has a Attack on Titan backpack. But just because something is popular doesn\\'t make it good. PLOT: So humans are now no longer at the top of the food chain and were nearly wiped out 100 years ago of 1000ish years ago (they neverreally explained what time period it it) so humanity is forced to lived behind massive walls to protect themselves from the Titans, these massive naked human looking monsters that eat humans. We start of to see a young trio of children going about their daily life and thinking about what all kids think of, what life is like outside the walls. More frolicking about happens and sudden a massive titan appears and breaks down the wall. Dozens of Titans invaded kill people and we get treated to one of the most emotionally gripping scenes I\\'ve every seen in a show. \\n\\nSo now our main protagonist Eren and his buddies Armin and Mikasa enlist in the army and go on their journey to kill all titans. This sounds bland but the story is going at a lightning pace that things change very fast and you can expect a twist and turn all throughout the show that it will keep you on your seats begging for more, or for my case, marathoning 10 episodes in a row. The story breaks the mold of generic revenge story and adds things like conspiracy and thriller aspects that propels the experience. However there are some points in the show were you can so glaringly seen them going all like \"This person is TOTALLY normal wink wink\" and the foreshadowing alarms go off, but that never distracted from the overall presentation of the story. Also there is lots of action and fighting stuff which I\\'ll get too later...\\n\\nCHARACTERS: \\nOur main hero/protagonist is Eren Yeager, a young solider who enlist because he watched his mother get eaten by a titan and wants revenge. He is hot blooded and won\\'t take no for an answer. There\\'s Mikasa who is Eren\\'s stalker/adopted sister/baddass. Then there is Armin who is there to cry, get in the way and make plans for battle situations. Eren is too me at least in the beginning kind of a bland generic character. I\\'ve seen these kind of super angry main leads before and most of them aren\\'t interesting. Eren evolves just enough to keep him from being bland. Mikasa is a character that I think is a bit overrated. Before going into this show I read everywhere how Mikasa is the best character ever created and I just don\\'t see it. OK sure is ridiculously talented in combat. OK she isn\\'t a generic tsundere. What stands out to me is here wanting to protect Eren which makes for a lot of speculation as too what their relationship actually is, but Eren is more or less an ass to Mikasa in those situations even though Eren does care for her just not in the same way she does. I\\'m am really glad that the writers didn\\'t make these two characters love birds as that shtick has been used over and over and over. Armin is the only main character that seems to have a working brain as he doesn\\'t go on titan murdering rampages. He is also practically useless in combat. He comes up with ridiculously complicated battle strategies that seem too always go as planned or at least achieve the objective even after a major fault happens that ends up killing half the squad. Yes this show has the Tomino \"kill em all\" approach to characters. Everyone in this show you like will probably die, that sounds like a spoiler but its not. I had to start telling myself not to like characters because I feared that they would get eaten five minutes later. Having characters that don\\'t have plot armor makes the show fell more action packed that it already is.... and it is. The interaction between the characters is good and a shout-out to Levi.\\n\\nART/ANIMATION:\\nWell... My word who is funding these people the Brooklyn Nets? The budget for this show must be endless as I never recall a time when this show didn\\'t look like pure awesome. The animation for this show is simply outstanding, the actions scenes are breathtaking, and when they used the 3D movement gear my God does it look stunning. The art style is rather unique too with thick black borders around the characters and the Titans (some of them) look very disturbing. The scenery is gorgeous and those action scenes.... just so good.\\n\\nSOUND:\\nTHAT OPENING!!! Yea the first opening for this show is amazing. So is the second one. So is the fight music, and so is the dub and yes I said DUB. DUB! I can already see people moving their mouse to \"Not helpful\" before going onto the next review but the dub for this show was done by Funimation and such is of the up most quality. Bryce Papenbrook is great as Eren because no one can scream like him, Trina Nishimura fits Mikasa almost freakishly well and Josh Grelle does a great job making Armin sound like a wimp because that\\'s exactly what he is. Oh and Matthew Mercer is just silky smooth as Levi. Great job Funimation for getting a good cast.\\n\\nENDING (NO SPOILERS)\\nThe ending is paramount. This story is incomplete but there is a second season coming sometime soon so that makes this section pointless, if it were too end right now it wound be terrible but it doesn\\'t so yea.\\n\\nOVERALL:\\nAttack on Titan has been the only show that has made me impatient enough to go out and read ahead in the manga. This first season was extremely well done and the series as a whole has tremendous potential to be something very special indeed. I give this a strong recommendation too anyone that likes a good story driven high action series. Attack on Titan is a great watch.',\n",
       " \"Oh boy, Attack on Titan. Up front, the more time passes between me, having watched the show and now thinking about it, the more average it becomes. I came to the conclusion, that the show severely lacks memorable moments. Many may call BS on me for that, but really think about it. Excluding what happens in Episode eight...I think, there was almost nothing for me to remember fondly. I'll say, that upon first completing the show, I quite liked it and would have even called it good, but that is just not the case anymore. Most of the things like character-motivation, their development and thepacing just seem quite off. The characters like Eren, Mikasa and Armin are completely one dimensional and void of almost any interesting aspect. \\nNow I know. It is shounen, what do I even expect? But the straw of thinking too deep into it doesn't work this time, because even when you scratch the surface of these characters, they still seem to be completely uninteresting. There is no concept worth exploring here, no  good idea hooking you to the adventure and what is there, is boring after a few episodes. \\n\\nI try to at least be as objective as possible with these reviews (try to, not succeeding, shut up), but in this case I can't not mention the constant annoyance the main character and his constant angsting about the things that happened in the first episode, is. Jesus Christ, his whole existence revolves around angst. Realistic portrayals of characters do not just use one aspect of them and blatter us over the head with that non-stop. There needs to be at least one high-moment to correlate all of the low moments. If he is in constant angst-mode and always shouting, it becomes meaningless and more of a joke or a running gag, than a conflict or a struggle for the character. And that problem encumbers most characters in this show. Their constant one-note struggles and conflicts ultimately do not mean anything because it is all we ever see of them. Characters, besides the plot are paramount for me, which is why it is almost everything I talk about in this, but it is the main point I want to give you an understanding of, so there you go. \\n\\nAnd so people in this show are not remembered for their characterization or their interesting personalities but rather for very stereotypical aspects and their designs, which is very repetitive by the way. It just looks too bland and uninteresting for my taste. They could have at least incorporated a few different uniforms and colors but no, brown it is. \\nThat could very well be the name of the anime, “brown it is-the anime”, but I digress. \\nWhat looked like something good in the first eight or so episodes came to a grinding hold in the boulder arc, did not really pick up after that and just left me with a great desire of the story continuing like it did in the first eight episodes and not the way it did. The few twists it threw in were nothing too surprising and pretty easy to figure out, if you at least try to pay minimum attention. The last scene at the end failed completely in hooking me for the next season and that pretty much sums it all up.\\n\\nIt's almost addicting to not care about this anime anymore. Hype didn't last for good reasons. Stuff's painfully mediocre with a tendency to annoy me more than entertaining me.\\n\\nOP theme still awesome though.\",\n",
       " \"Attack on Titan or Shingeki no Kyojin has become one of the biggest anime, at least stateside, over the past few years. Unfortunately many shows that are popular often get caught up in the hype of fans and when people view it when hype has begun to cool down it is often that these shows often get a lot of backlash since they are not as good as everyone who watched it years ago says it is. Fortunately I think that Attack on Titan is well made enough that it will not be seen as trash by viewers years from now when if it doeshave some issues.   \\n\\nTo start out with the good the show has top notch production values. The animation stays great throughout which especially shines during the completely awesome and often brutal action sequences that are sprinkled throughout the series. A word must also be said that the show also has a very unique art style with heavy outlines around the characters which helps the show pop out without doing anything too distracting.  \\n\\nDespite the oldtimey setting of the show the music often has a somewhat electronic feel to it and while some might be distracted the music really helps set the epic mood and at times can get you pumped for the next fight.  \\n\\nWhile the story is never too out of the ordinary, the world that Attack on Titan creates is interesting enough that you are guaranteed to stay interested in whats going on.\\n\\nBut everything is not perfect unfortunately. \\n\\nWhile there are a plethora of characters in the show that are often very interesting, most of the cast outside of the main 3 protagonists don't really get enough screen time to get very developed. It also doesn't help that some characters will just randomly die before you get attached. While one of Attack on Titan's claim to fame s the fact that they often murder characters you often don't get enough attachment to some who die in order to make their deaths have as much emotional weight as they probably should. \\n\\nThe show also has slight pacing problems as the show goes at a almost breakneck pace in the first few episodes until it suddenly decides to slow down. Luckily by the half way point enough happens to make this less of a problem. \\n\\nAlso while this show certainly tries to be epic it sometimes goes into hilariously over the top territory but not too often.  \\n\\nEven with these problems the show is still a great watch. It is quite brutal though so if you can't stand violence stay out. Also the storyline isn't complete yet and at this point a sequel is very likely which is good since I along with many are interested to see where the story goes and aren't willing to read the manga to find out. \\n\\nSo while it may not be perfect Attack on Titan it seems that it is just too big to ignore and that is why I am happy that it is of a very high quality.\",\n",
       " \"Shingeki no Kyojin (Attack on Titan) undoubtedly made it as the top anime of 2013. Hajime Isayama’s creation gained fans across the globe with its thrills, surprising twists, and memorable characters. Compared to other apocalyptic anime, Hajime develops undefeatable and menacing creatures: giant man-eating titans --- overgrown human-like creatures that range in size and ability. Story (8) The suspense is incredible and exciting with constant gory scenes of titans brutalizing humans to the fullest degree, whether it is crushing skulls with their massive thumbs or tearing apart the human body. Combat action involves stunning choreography as armed soldiers spin or fly in mid-air with their 3Dmaneuver gear before striking lethal blows to titans. Certain circumstances cannot be predicted accurately as SnK shows no hesitation in killing off supporting characters. The majority of the episodes end in surprising and unexpected twists as soldiers fight to save humanity by risking their lives to accomplish one goal: destroy all of the titans. The pacing is steady, allowing viewers to understand the plot and characters with extreme detail. However, the primary objective is too complex to complete in 25 episodes. A cliffhanger ceases the opportunity for more exploration of the titans and other characters.\\n\\nTip: In the middle of each episode is a helpful “Info We Can Share So Far” section. It lasts for less than 20 seconds, so it’s advised to pause and read the info. Most of them are hidden data that are not quoted by characters in the series, including history of the titans and info about the communities. \\n\\nCharacter (8)\\n\\nThe majority of the characters, including the MCs, have motives behind their actions, and they develop and strengthen after experiencing tragic events. For example, Mikasa’s sole purpose of protecting Eren throughout the series has more to do than just her personal feelings for him. Eren is the main protagonist and has a strong passion to destroy every single titan. He was intolerably whiny and irresponsible in the beginning but slightly matured halfway through the series due to interactions with experienced squad members. He gains common sense and looks at situations from different angles. However, he does not fully develop as his old ways sometimes reappear.\\n\\nMikasa and Armin may appear clingy to Eren at times, but the trio spend much time apart with other characters, primarily during the second half. Mikasa is the strong female heroine who is a master in combat action. She’s fearless and presents a major attraction with her swift moves of killing multiple titans in one blow. Armin showed great improvement in his character. He starts out as a coward but becomes willing to strategize despite his fear. He is also quite the genius and contributes to resolving various mysteries of the titans. Along with Armin, there are many characters who present or develop great charismatic skills. \\n\\nThe large number of squad members have personalities ranging from indifferent to determined, and they all distinguish with their levels of combat ability and leadership. Some of their attitudes can be hilarious, depending on one’s sense of humor. The anime goes into the past of some of the important characters and highlight relationships between them. It helps the viewer understand the characters and develop a love/hate relationship with them. The only downside is the inability to explore other important characters before the finale.\\n\\nAnimation (8)\\n\\nProduction I.G. and Wit Studio did a fantastic job with the animation. The thick outlines displays details within the background and character design. The artwork emphasizes excellent visual effects of combat action and characters maneuvering between buildings, trees, and other landscapes. All of the settings from the cityscape to the forest are remarkable. Character designs are distinct, and the unisex military uniforms reveal great details, thanks to the outlines. Characters’ fear and other emotions are generally shown with black lines drawn on their faces, contributing to the horrifying theme of SnK. The black lines symbolize distress, anger, frustration, etc. Bloody scenes of titans crushing and eating human bodies fulfill in making those primary creatures look terrifying. Titans are drawn as ugly and naked overgrown human beings. Some are shown to be skinless, and the vast majority are the opposite. \\n\\nThere are a few problems with the art. There's no distinction in gender between the titans. It was not an issue in the beginning, but it later becomes something important to note in the series. Another poor part about the animation are the stills. There are some scenes that are at a standstill with the characters talking like an idle page in a storybook. Other times, there would be fixed scenes with only one or two objects striking attention with movement.\\n\\nSound (9)\\n\\nThe voice actors adjusted to the characters’ personality, making their emotions and identities suitable for the fearful and serious atmosphere. The stomps and groans of titans presents practicality to the anime’s theme, considering the type of monsters Hajime decided to create. The music from the theme songs to the background is memorable. Background music includes warrior-like songs and sometimes fast-paced or choral music during fights. The entire soundtrack adds a grand quality to the series. \\n\\nEnjoyment (9) / Overall (8)\\n\\nSnK is one of my favorite action anime, even after re-watching it a few times. In addition to the cliffhanger, I found Eren to be really annoying. There was a scene where Eren hurt Mikasa physically, and I hated him for intentionally harming a lady. SnK’s focus on other characters and increased suspense made it much better. The characters' behavior were humorous at times, and there was always something to look forward to after each episode. As a result, I experienced laughter and shock throughout the series. Due to its popularity, I’m looking forward to a 2nd season and reading the manga in the meantime.\\n\\nOverall, SnK has entertaining combat action, surprising events, and remarkable visuals. It provides details throughout the series to keep the viewer current on events, and it gives quite a bit of attention to the characters. Apart from its incomplete ending, I highly recommend any fan of action anime to become familiar with the SnK franchise.\",\n",
       " 'Shingeki no Kyojin, the anime that has brought forth a new wave of anime fans and stormed the anime world when it debuted in spring of 2013. An anime that was quickly subbed and added to Netflix after it\\'s airing, that has gained the attention of thousands of people who normally do not watch anime. It has sold extremely well in Japan and the manga has profited well in the States as well. This must mean the series is something revolutionary and a game changer for all anime after it correct? After all it can\\'t all be hype, there has to be some serious substancebehind all of this right?\\n\\nMost fans will tell you off the bat that it is not like other series, that it is heavily violent, shocking, and sometimes horrifying. That it is a world full of interesting characters and sudden death at every turn. And all of that is true...for the first five episodes. After an introductory which I would say is worthy of the praise it gets, the series seems to fall apart extremely quickly and after it\\'s smash beginning has so substance left to support itself afterwards. \\n\\nI\\'ll spare a summary of the story as it\\'s almost hard not to know what the story is about by this point. I\\'ll give you my thoughts on it in one word: Horrendous. To call the story mediocre would be too much praise. Out of the three main characters only one stands out as anything special, that being the character of Armin Arlert. However as interesting as he is compared to his two other mains, he is given significantly less time on screen to showcase this than the other two. The characters of Eren and Mikasa are without a doubt two of the worst characters ever conceived in any work of fiction. I would attempt to discuss their personalities but there is little to nothing to discuss. A standard cardboard box has more depth to it than those two, and would probably make a better lead character as well.\\n\\nIgnoring the horrific set of main characters, the supporting cast is dotted with traces of what could be interesting characters, but there is never enough time given to them to let that shine through. They glimmer with hope that Isayama\\'s writing could be something other than pathetic and are one of the only things keeping SnK afloat in an ocean of fecal matter. \\n\\nThe story itself must have been written by a fourth grader at best. The \"plot twists\" (even calling them that is a stretch) and sudden character death are all presented in such a shallow way it is often hard to care about any character that dies or any new plot development (hint: there are none, the manga is good at one thing and that is providing hundreds of questions and not a single answer). The entire pacing of the series itself is some of the worst I have had the displeasure of experiencing in years. The plot itself goes from moving at a sluggish pace and solving nothing, to a break neck speed where a character is introduced one chapter only to be killed off in the next one. \\n\\nThe art and animation jump between not bad and hard to even look at. The character designs suffer an often same-face syndrome worse than Araki\\'s recent style and excluding background shots, the art is subpar at most and there is much more to be expected from a studio like IG Production. Their is a constant reuse of animations and scenes to such an extent that anyone would has this displeasure of watching more than one episode in a day would find incredibly bothersome. Reusing an animation once or twice is forgivable and almost expected, but to the extent they are reused in SnK there is absolutely no excuse.\\n\\nThe sound design is the only thing I can find hard to complain about, in a series where everything is so awful it is hard to even say something comforting about one of it\\'s only good points. Which is an absolute shame as I can say the OST is probably the only thing to ever get from the anime at all.\\n\\nMy final verdict on SnK will be a series of questions to ask yourself before watching it. Do you enjoy awful characters that have no depth and lack the personality of even a desk chair? Do you enjoy wallowing in absolute shit? Do you have any other reason to watch this other than to laugh at how utterly irredeemable it is? There is not a single good thing to say about the series other than that the first few episodes are \"not bad\", apart from that it would hurt to attempt to say anything good about this series.\\n\\nIf you still believe you should watch this show, may God have mercy on your soul, for you are going to need it.',\n",
       " 'There\\'s only one possible number to represent Shingeki no Kyojin, and that number is a certain one-digit number between 1 and 10 and is a multiple of 3. You guessed it. Six. Or nine, flipped the other way. I know you anime whores and die-hard SnK fans are probably sitting in your chairs ready to light torches and grab your pitchforks and form a mob right outside my front door because \"six\" is a pretty low-end score, at least on my ranking scale let alone for a hyped-up series like SnK, but come to think of it, did you come here to confirm your opinions about SnKbeing 2013\\'s greatest anime show, or did you come here to whine in American-accented Japanese at the next guy that gives SnK a low score because you hate it when people disagree with you?\\n\\nI have to admit that SnK, through my eyes, was a decent show at best, decent being the number \"six\". And before you and wonder \"wut skoar did dis n00b giv sao?!?!?!\", let me tell you beforehand, I rated it 8, in my own unbiased opinion. I wasn\\'t excited at all to watch SAO, and I was pretty darn excited to hear rave reviews about this new show that brings Jack and the Beanstalk down to Earth, multiplies the number of giants involved, and gives the humans no beanstalk to escape to safer grounds. It sounds interesting, but was it a good show?\\n\\nSix. I\\'ll stop saying that now.\\n\\nStory: A fantastic tale about 10-meter-tall zombies eating out every woman and child like certified pedophiles in the world\\'s largest buffet platter with three different types of meals: Outer Wall for peasant\\'s dishes, Inner Wall for middle-class, and the ultimate dessert: the King and his loyal subjects for those fattening delicacies. I believe the first episode gave this story the right amount of pressure to set the rest of the series of events in motion when [literally] the world\\'s largest pop star, Michael Jackson, resurrects as a Titan and has a change of heart to chase after married women instead of children, but a couple of years later, this leaves us absolutely.... nowhere.\\n\\nSee, I\\'m fine with that, at least it shows humans are struggling to keep themselves off the main course by avoiding intervention with their larger selves, but what accelerated like a rocket from the beginning has become a race to reach the end as slowly and safely as possible. My grandmother doesn\\'t drive slow enough to keep the same pacing as SnK\\'s storyline, and what should be 24 minutes of giant ass-kicking is in reality 15 minutes of build-up, 5 minutes of something ACTUALLY happening, 1 minute to introduce the cliffhanger, 1 minute for the opening sequence, 1 minute for the ending sequence, and another minute for desperate neckbeards to unzip their pants and fantasize about Mikasa Ackerman being their \"waifu\". That Mikasa Minute usually occurs in-between the build-up scenes, so on the plus side, it gives weeaboos everywhere a chance to wipe their monitors (or leave it there so they can claim to their friends that they also ejaculated on Eren\\'s face).\\n\\nArt: I can see why every male anime nerd wants to stick something onto their screens every time the females show up. Shingeki no Kyojin has some of the best aesthetics of an animated series that I\\'ve ever seen/heard, from the show\\'s sheer amount of gory content to the snapping of bones (which I still feel). On that alone, I\\'ve felt something.\\n\\nCharacter: A good number of the characters make very little sense to me. Armin van Buuren RIAA Multi-Platinum Arlert makes spot-on predictions because he\\'s probably reading ahead in his own manga series. Eren Jaegermeister wants to kill all of the Titans and save everyone, but his indecisiveness causes more people to die, not that it matters that dozens die in his care. Captain Levi Denim claims to dislike pointless deaths, but every time he sacrifices a soldier, he never completes his operation, and when he executes the operation, more people end up dying anyways. That\\'s like telling people you\\'re a green politician, yet the car you drive is an environmentally-friendly Hummer H2.\\n\\nWe also get characters with very little introduction and very little development, who only seem to fill in the role of creating more pointless deaths. Titans are scary, indeed they are, but are soldiers really THAT expendable? One does not simply self-impregnate, clone, or genetically-engineer new soldiers to fight. Sooner or later, there will be less soldiers to feed to the Titans, but then again, the author could always create new ones out of black matter to keep drawing his fanbase in.\\n\\nEnjoyment: Despite what I have to say about SnK, I found it to be an enjoyable watch. It delivers softcore male pornography on a large scale, and sometimes it adds an extra X to the already triple-X rating and exposes what\\'s UNDER the skin for those hardcore biology nerds (I know, it\\'s too intense just thinking about human anatomy).\\n\\nWhen the action sequences come around, they deliver. There\\'s something special about the 3D Maneuver Gear that allows for more dynamic camera angles, giving you that same high-speed sensation the characters should also be experiencing. However, if I could pinpoint my absolute favorite moment of this show, I wouldn\\'t highlight anything involving 3DMG. Instead, I would opt for Episode 8, the underground scene when members of the 104th Training Corps attempt to retake their base. Why THAT scene, you may ask? Because it\\'s more fun discharging your guns in the Titans\\' faces, and it\\'s better doing it in a group.\\n\\nOverall: Yes, I enjoyed watching. Yes, the aesthetics were phenomenal and it did draw me in from the beginning when Michael Jackson went on tour to Wall Maria and ate one of his fans. I thought the action was superb and it was a thrill to watch. But does it make it a great show? In my eyes, not really. Slow pacing, meaningless death, and heavy amounts of build-up define SnK. I know there are people out there who will complain, disagree, and ultimately flame on my profile for disliking SnK, but then again, take this into consideration: I gave this series a 9 from the beginning, and I ultimately decided to drop it to 6. Am I being biased? I don\\'t think so.\\n\\nBut if you hate my opinion, or if you\\'re hoping to defend the glory of SnK by trying to convert another non-believer to your SnK Fan Club or whatever the hell you\\'d like to call it, then do me a favor and don\\'t try to shove your opinion down my throat. I\\'ve had it happen already, and it\\'ll only tell me how much of a steaming pile of shit you are.',\n",
       " \"To begin, I mostly stumbled across AoT because of its high rating and under that premise assumed that it has to be somewhat decent, which it is. On the whole though, it didn't strike me as spectacular as some people made it out to be for reasons I shall explain below. Story/Pace: 3/10 To be honest, the first couple of episodes had a wonderful fast pace as the main protagonists advanced, more about their strange world and titan relationship was revealed e.t.c. However, like most animes who give it their full right away, it ran out of ammunition very soon and a good 1/3 of all episodesas of ep 12 (I didn't check, so I may be off) were recaps and comparatively generic giant-vs-human action. So while the story was initially very gripping, I spent the last few episodes grinding my teeth, while hoping for something other than human group A being slaughtered by giant group B to happen and was sorely disappointed. If I only had taken into account the first dozen episodes, this would be an 8-9, but given this endless drawing out, the anime really does not deserve that.\\n\\nCharacters: 4/10\\nThe characters of this anime had their boons/banes, but by tendency, need improvement. Our protagonists are a bit very stereotypical, but made interesting mostly because they keep dying/almost-dying. Generally, all characters are very dramatic and are constantly on the verge of/at a nervous breakdown. Although this would typically annoy me, the anime does deserve credit for making the most convincing war environment I have ever seen (making it much more preferable to those creepy ones where people just casually brush off that their friends just got butchered). \\nThis unique aspect does however trip and fall horribly among the sidecharacters, who both spawn and die like flies. They show up and some of them die 3 episodes later which is very realistic, but perhaps a tad too realistic. I seriously struggled keeping track of all of them and at some point simply gave up on doing so. There are a few more important side characters who will likely survive, but on the whole I find that they all lack depth. One sees too little of them and when one does, they are either killing titans or mourning their friends, which makes it hard to learn new things about them and understand them.\\n\\nArt: 8/10\\nI must agree, that a good part of the artwork in this anime is phenomenally well done. The colours have a nice glow to them and the various phyiscal features are appropriate. In that aspect, the anime deserves substantial credit. I did however, notice a number of moments where the animated component was missing and the characters were shouting at the top of their lungs while statically standing there. Other scenes on the other hand move incredibly smoothly, so it seems a bit lazily done at times. Still on the whole, very good.\\n\\nSound: 7/10\\nThe music of the anime was decent and created an epic feel for the combat scenes. This has however, been done thousands of times and it didn't really stand out among the other animes that practice this. The voice-acting is harder to judge as I am not fluently Japanese, but seemed appropriate. On the whole the sound is good, but nothing special.\\n\\nEnjoyment: 4/10\\nI did enjoy the beginning of this anime, but it then quickly became disappointing due to aforementioned reasons. Towards the end I just felt like skipping ahead to where something interesting was revealed, but the anime ends with ultimately telling little more than what can be garnered from the first few episodes. I did also enjoy the titan fighting, but can say that the 1st titan fight was substantially more impressive than the 30th and as that was the content of all of the episodes, I bored quickly.\\n\\nOverall: 5.2/10\\nOn the whole I feel a bit bitter about the plot's speed, but for those who enjoy  action with high-definition picturesque imagery and epic music, I would recommend it. If you care more about a deep plot with lots of mysteries, don't bother.\",\n",
       " \"Attack on Titan and I have a history, one filled with love and hate, a re-watch, and the manga. Of course, it seems the entire anime/manga community (and some outside of it) have an opinion on this show. It’s widely popular and has been so for quite a while now. So, just how does this show about giant monsters that eat people take us all by storm? Let’s find out. Rather, I’ll do my best to tell you why I love it (now). Sometime to note is that I really didn’t like the AOT franchise when I first watched the anime. I wanted to likeit, but found the whole thing over hyped and too dramatic. However, after I read the manga and re-watched the show, I know have Survey Corps Cosplay and have become a die-hard fan.\\n\\nI am up to date on the manga. Detangling my feelings of the anime and manga won’t be easy, but I’ll do my best.\\n\\nThis review is spoiler free!\\n\\n[spoiler=Characters]Characters in the AOT franchise are 10/10, but, when strictly concerning the anime, they stagger to an 8/10. On the surface, the characters come across fairly stereotypical. Eren, the shounen lead, is obsessed with getting stronger and revenge and possess a (seemingly) random power. Dig a little deeper and Eren reverses some shounen lead tropes. I can’t go into details without spoiling major things for those who aren’t caught up with the manga, but trust me: Eren isn’t a typically shounen lead. \\n\\nBack to the anime. \\n\\nA usual some of the most important lines and little moments that deepen characters aren’t in the anime. AOT characters’ growth is subtle, and the high-paced anime may even include those finer moments but they’re hard to catch amidst all the titan killing action. But, if you compare a character from his/her first episode to his/her last, you’ll see how the story has really shaped and changed the character.\\n\\nHere are some pluses. The characters are also relatively mature (as the show goes along. Warning: some start as VERY immature had have a lot of room to grow). Also, the characters beside the shounen lead get to have relationships (that actually change and grow) with each other. Again, it’s subtle. Bat an eyelash and you might miss it. \\n\\nThe characters make realistic choices. They react and behave like people who live in a desperate and relatively hopeless society. Some of their choices may surprise the viewer and unveil and new layer to a character. They’re not always the decision the viewers may want or like, but it makes the characters interesting and the story less predictable. Many of the secondary characters have unique and distinct personalities as well (this is largely due to the fact that later in the manga their importance increases significantly). Something to appreciate is the fact characters offer different opinions on the situation without the show spoon-feeding the viewer into thinking one view is better than another. Rather, the viewer must decide for his/herself what he/she believes. The show does not give a “right” or “wrong” answer. \\n\\nHowever, a lot of characters get tossed at the viewer simultaneously—and about half of them die. Without knowing who lives to become an important character later in the series and who becomes titan chow, it can be a little overwhelming. This is partly why the first time I watched the anime I didn’t enjoy it. People just kept dying so I stopped caring about any of them. This problem also makes it hard to notice the quiet growth between characters and their relationships. Now, after reading the manga and watching it again, I love them all (I even like the bad guys, or, at least, I find them complex and interesting). \\n\\nAnother minus: the characters are overdramatic at times (for me). While I feel the desperation and understand their hopelessness, I still roll my eyes once in a while. Before the story has pulled you and before you believe and feel how sad they are, it can be distracting. I’ve met a couple of people who’ve even found it humorous at times (I never went that far, but it did (and in three scenes still does) annoy me). The show really plays it up too. It will show random scenes of grieving families that didn’t appear before and don’t show up after just to prove how dramatic and dark it can be. The world is dark enough that these moments subtract from the show instead of add to it. [/spoiler]\\nScore: 8/10\\n\\n+subtle development\\n+believable relationships \\n+varying personalities \\n+flawed \\n+more than a stereotype \\n+believable reactions/personality  \\n-judgmental protagonist\\n-over dramatic \\n-too many characters introduced at once\\n\\n[spoiler=Story] When I first watched the anime, I wasn’t invested in the plot (this is largely due to the fact I wasn’t invested in the characters). After I read the manga, I flung myself headlong into the story and now read the chapters as soon as I can get my grubby fingers on them. After re-watching the anime, I can say the author has had a plan for series from the start. I missed hundreds of little clues while watching it the first time. Answers to huge questions are right in front of your face (I honestly feel stupid for missing them). Some twists are impossible to see coming and only after you’ve caught up to the manga can you fully appreciate how well crafted the plot is. \\n\\nSome things were still extremely predictable in the anime. I’m hardly ever surprised by big “shocking” moments in anything (anime/manga/books/whatever) and saw a lot of things coming. Others have told me that the anime surprised them, and the show does deliberately play on your expectations of a shounen. There are a few moments where it sets the viewer up to believe he/she knows where the story is going only to whack him/her in the face with a quick turn. That was highly enjoyable. \\n\\nOne thing to keep is mind is the sheer ridiculous appearance of the enemy. Frankly, the titans are some of the stupidest looking villains in a story to date. While terrifying, it’s humiliating to watch humanity get wrecked by funny looking naked giants (a fact even the characters address). Humanity is often compared to cattle as well, which leads me to think the viewer is supposed to find it frustrating and embarrassing to be defeated by such monsters. \\n\\nAs for the plot itself, there is nothing particularly unique about it. The world feels well explained and detailed. And, better yet, it’s surprising easy to relate too. If you feel powerless, like nothing you do matters and all you want to do is matter, somehow; if you feel like there are problems you just can’t face but you wish you were brave enough to stand up against—then this story will touch you, heart and soul. \\n\\nStripe the story down to its bones and it’s about people struggling to defeat enemies larger than themselves, to face despair and learn how to keep moving. I’m serious here. The characters’ goal is not survival but for their deaths to have significance. In this sense, AOT goes beyond an anime. It reveals the heart of a desperate people and how to never give up. \\n\\nThese characters have simple dreams and desires batted against insurmountable enemies and stark fear. Such raw simplicity rests in most human hearts, and I believe a lot of people connect with that and turn this story into something bigger. I certainly didn’t the first time I watched it, but I do now. Now, when I see the Wings of Freedom, I see a symbol of hope and determination. I see people who are willing to sacrifice themselves despite their fear and doubt because it’s the right thing to do. I see someone I can aspire to be because theses characters are afraid and angry and flawed just like me. I see heroes I can believe in.\\n\\nA lot of the sentiments I’m referring to occur after the Survey Corps appear. I believe the story improves immensely after its entrance. I find the Survey Corps the real heart and protagonist—if you will—of the series. Don’t misunderstand: the individual characters are fantastic, as is the first half of the show. But the Corps is who and what I connect with. \\n\\n A step away from the sentimental and existential-ness of this review, the plot is put together extremely well. It moves fast without sacrificing character development. And you can tell the author has an endgame. He knows where he wants this story to go and is slowly taking the viewer there, revealing one little fact at a time, usually one that only opens more questions (the manga has answered some and created more, but things are starting to congeal and it’s fantastic!)

I think this would appeal to many westerners... it's brutal, it makes you think, makes you feel and most of all it immerses you. I've rewatched it through 3 times (once on my own, once with my friends and once with an ex) just for those 3 episodes at the end! Pretty big deal for me considering I usually have to wait at least 2 years to properly enjoy rewatching a show, andI've watched it 4 times within that same space of time.\\n\\nFinished this for my first time between the end of 2013 or start of 2014... can't remember when but I've been as eagerly awaiting the sequel (which is out in 2016 :\",\n",
       " '**SPOILER FREE REVIEW** \"Sind sie das Essen? Nein, wir sind der Jäger!\" This German phrase, which roughly translates to \"Are you the prey? No, we are the hunters!\" Is a term that people who have watched this anime are all too familiar with by now. Attack on Titan (a.k.a. Shingeki no Kyojin) is to 2013 what Sword Art Online was to 2012; a show so hyped that you can\\'t call yourself an anime fan if you haven\\'t at least heard of it. While I haven\\'t finished watching SAO, I am well aware that the majority of people feel it was ruined by the hype. Does AoT fallinto this same category, well, honestly, no. I don\\'t think it does.\\n\\nStory: 8/10\\nIn an alternate universe, humanity has been nearly wiped out after the appearance of a new species of beast whose sole existence seems to be eradicating humans; the titans. Titans are massive, mysterious creatures whose origins, method of reproduction, and true motivations remain completely unknown to humanity. The humans have retreated into 3 circular walls that are large and strong enough to keep the Titans out, but for how long? \\nAoT gets major props from me for creating the darkest, most convincing, most tragic war environment I\\'ve ever seen in a TV show. The sheer amount of suffering, physical trauma, psychological trauma, and portrayal of devastation is so horrible and disturbing that it is beautiful. If you like watching happy-go-lucky, feel-good anime, this show is NOT for you. Rule number one of watching AoT is to NEVER expect something good to happen. Doe it seem like something good is about to happen? Well, something bad is probably about to happen. \\nAoT really manages to create an atmosphere where the viewer is viciously cheering for humanity to prevail, and that is no easy task. And of course, that just makes it all the more devastating when that character you were finally starting to like gets eaten. The storyline is extremely engrossing and interesting, but due to the fact that the story is incomplete (hopefully season 2 will be announced soon), I can\\'t give it 10/10 or 9/10 in good taste, but AoT is very much a plot driven anime.\\n\\nArt: 9/10\\nVery detailed and stylized. Style is something that is very hard to explain, but it fits the atmosphere perfectly. I loved the art.\\n\\nSound: 10/10\\nEPIC soundtrack. \"Epic\" is an overused word, but all you have to do is listen to the opening to know that this show is just EPIC! The voice acting is stellar as well.\\n\\nCharacters: 7/10\\nSeeing that this is an anime that is not finished, it makes sense that a lot of the character development is also unfinished, but the main characters are all intriguing. \\nEren, the protagonist, is headstrong and reckless, but also very compassionate. He has a fascinating and tragic backstory (that the show still hasn\\'t completely told), and his internal struggle between either sacrificing his humanity for the good of his race or maintaining his humanity and saving every individual he can is very engrossing and one of the show\\'s strong points. Eren is clearly a round character and I like him quite a bit.\\nMikasa is Eren\\'s childhood friend, and to say Mikasa is protective of Eren is an understatement. She has no family left, so Eren is the only thing that keeps her going any more. She is by far the best fighter out of all the recruits and is a total badass when fighting. You can\\'t not love Mikasa...\\nArmin, also Eren\\'s childhood friend,  is a frail boy who isn\\'t much of a fighter, but possess great strategic intellect. He has proven to be one of the show\\'s more dynamic characters as he breaks out of his shell as the anime goes on and realizes that he isn\\'t as useless as he thinks he is.\\nLevi is a BAMF. That\\'s all you need to know.\\nThere are also tons of intriguing side-characters, but I wouldn\\'t get too attached to them if I were you. NOBODY in this show is unkillable, except probably Mikasa.  Don\\'t be surprised when a seemly major character gets eaten in the blink of an eye. AoT really keeps you on the edge of your seat in that regard. If the show was complete and the character\\'s development was finished, characters would have likely gotten a 9/10 or 10/10.\\n\\nOverall: 8/10\\nSo far, AoT is the rare case of an anime living up to the hype. With an epic plot, complex characters, badass art style, and an epic soundtrack, AoT has the potential to be something really special, but lets wait for the end of the second season (which will totally be announced soon) and it\\'s ending to draw any conclusions.',\n",
       " \"So, SnK. Undoubtedly the most popular show not just of spring and summer 2013, but of 2013 as a whole. You can't go on an anime related site and not see it, and it's very likely to pop up in discussion. Hyped to high hell by almost every anime fan out there. But does it deserve all the attention it gets? Story: 4/10 The premise was great, and had me quite interested at the start. The idea of humanity fighting for their life against an unfathomable opponent who popped out of nowhere is quite interesting. But did the anime deliver? I'm afraid I'd have to say Iwas slightly disappointed. To start with, it damn interesting. Titans attack, mass panic, humans forced to retreat, great; Interesting. What wasn't so interesting were the episodes which followed.\\nWhile the scenes with titans in them were intriguing, and at best enticing, everything in between seemed like filler. At one point I even recall the cast spending 3 entire episodes discussing moving a boulder, how to move a boulder, and the main character angsting over turning into a titan in order to move a boulder. I'm even partially expecting the OVA to be about the boulder.\\n\\nArt: 3/10\\nI mean, come on. Am I really supposed to rate it higher than that? The animation and art in this show was incredibly lazy. The show was chock full of still shots, some of which lasted for over 5 seconds, and panning over motionless scenes, without the characters moving a muscle. A lot of powerpoint-tier animation in there as well. The character designs weren't terrible, but they definitely weren't marvelous either. I also am of the believe that the show's artists were having a contest to see who could make the most ridiculous looking titan, which, in all honestly, could be more entertaining than the plot progression of the show at times.\\n\\nSound: 6/10\\nNo complaints here. I do feel like a few sound effects, like the titan-transformation, were repeated, however.\\n\\nCharacter: 4/10\\nNo one really stood out for me. The only character development I can note is if they were about to die, and in most cases they did, so they're dead anyway. Minus points for having a main character who's entire personality was REVENGE and I'M GONNA KILL THEM ALL, and a female lead who's motivation consisted of protecting the main character. Bonus points for Jean.\\n\\nEnjoyment: 6/10\\nIt's not all bad, I actually enjoyed the show a little, although it did annoy me at times when literally nothing was happening. But, I won't deny I found the show overall entertaining, but most definitely not on the level a lot people seem to. I'm honestly baffled by how this show became so popular as I can only fathom it as slightly above average at best.\\n\\nWell, that's all. Overall, I'd say that The Eotena Onslaught is a decent show, but don't go and watch it expecting a masterpiece.\",\n",
       " 'The fact that so many bloggers still name Shingeki no Kyogin “the greatest or most significant or most influential\" anime series of 2013 only tells you how anime still is from becoming a serious art. Anime critics have long recognized that the greatest anime series of all times are Neon Genesis Evangelion and CardCaptor Sakura, who were not the most famous or richest or best sellers of their times, let alone of all times. Other critics rank the highly controversial Aku no Hana over classic anime who were highly popular in courts around Japan. Teenage bloggers are still blinded by commercial success: Shingeki no Kyojinsold more than anyone else (not true, by the way), therefore they must have been the greatest. True anime critics grow up watching a lot of anime of the past. Shingeki no Kyojin fans are often totally ignorant of the anime of the past, they barely know the best sellers. No wonder they will think that Shingeki no Kyojin did anything worth of being saved.\\n\\nIn a sense Shingeki no Kyojin are emblematic of the status of modern anime criticism as a whole: too much attention to commercial phenomena and too little attention to the merits of real anime. If somebody composes the most divine anime seires but Crunchyroll refuses to hype it up and stream it around the world, a lot of bloggers will ignore it. If every teenager on MAL hype up an anime series which is as stereotyped as one can be but launches it worldwide, your average critic will waste rivers of ink on said series. This is the sad status of modern anime criticism.\\n\\nShingeki no Kyjin sells not because it\\'s the greatest anime series of the decade but simply because it is easy to sell to the masses: it has no difficult content, it has no technical innovations, it has no creative depth. It\\'s just a bunch of gritty 3-minute action scenes which teenagers like to overhype and rave about how \"epic\" it was. If somebody had not invented \"Shingeki no Hype\" in 2013, you would not have wasted five minutes of your time to read a page about such a trivial anime which is mediocre at best.',\n",
       " 'Popular anime very rarely receive balanced reviews, which is a shame, because they often set themselves up for a balanced judgement. You either get people worshipping the ground that it would walk on if it hypothetically grew legs and start walking, or people throwing so much crap at it that it becomes in serious need of a shower. Shingeki no Kyojin is no different in this regard, but almost uniquely among recent mainstream titles it\\'s actually deserving of much of the praise it gets. Don\\'t get me wrong, you can still expect a balanced review here. This certainly isn\\'t the life-changing and complex masterpiece thatmany people will promise you, but neither is it as shallow and bland as a lot of shounen anime prove to be.\\n\\nWhen examining the story, it\\'s best to get the flaws out of the way first. Shingeki no Kyojin is predictable. Very predictable. In fact, the final 2 arcs hinge upon an important mystery element, and if you haven\\'t worked out the big twist almost immediately, then you must have already kissed your braincells goodbye. It certainly does have surprising elements, but when the progression of the plot becomes dependant upon a major story twist it starts to become a little obvious how things will turn out. A second key issue that the series suffers from is a lack of engagement around the mid-point. I\\'m talking about the \"Battle for Trost\" arc, when I simply found that I no longer felt emotionally invested in the story, nor did I particularly care about the conflicts of the characters. One suspects that this is a side effect of the conversion from manga to anime (though I can\\'t be sure, as I have not read the manga). Shingeki no Kyojin tends to place a lot of dramatic flare on events but the action and development that take place in this arc were perhaps not entirely suited to the impactive stylistic elements that we witness, and it all starts to feel a tad inane.\\n\\nNow, it\\'s important to note my use of the phrase \"impactive stylistic elements,\" because when I say that Shingeki no Kyojin has dramatic impact, I mean it. It might not be the most amazingly well-written anime in history, but it certainly ranks among the most absorbing as well as the most intense. It builds a rich and complex world with an interesting society and carefully crafted history. We see the structure of the military, the social class system and the lives and attitudes of various demographics clearly laid out before us even when they are not necessarily integral to the plot. It makes it believable, and that makes it absorbing, and this in turn can make it both gripping and powerful. When the action hits it\\'s a cathartic experience, riddled with brutal violence alongside the typical OTT flash of the shounen genre. It looks good and it hits hard. When it slows down to prioritise drama, it generally feels personal and relevant (with the finest example being the finale of the \"Expedition\" arc). The characters do feel a little static unfortunately, but there\\'s some nice development thrown in that hinges upon decent character conflicts and interesting backstories. At times however, it becomes apparent that several characters are forgotten throughout the course of the story, though it is entirely possible that a continuation will expand upon these unfortunate victims of limited season length.\\n\\nHighly stylised while still showcasing normal anime conventions, the art and animation are entirely deserving of all the praise they get. The animation has weight and the aesthetic is effective and unusual. At times, and most often when the show slows down, inconsistent character models become noticeable, but not to any concerning degree. And if we\\'re talking sounds, then it\\'s damned close to perfect. Fantastic musical score and great voice acting. Whatever you think of the story, you\\'d be wrong to call Shingeki no Kyojin anything other than a technical masterpiece.\\n\\nNot much else to say, so I\\'ll leave you with this closing statement: watch it. Even if, like me, you tend to adopt the attitude that because many people lack critical judgement it means that most mainstream anime aren\\'t as good as popular opinion might imply, at least be open-minded enough to appreciate the possibility that, just this once, the majority may be right.',\n",
       " 'The first season of attack on Titan was one of the most interesting animes i have watched. A great story with still so much to be discovered. I found that the story represents a racial war. You see the titans almost have no reason to kill as many humans as they do. It represents what Caucasians did to the african Americans back in the slavery years. With a great story, exceptional graphics the only place i saw Attack on Titan go wrong was the characters. Now im not being to critical, we can all imagine that we would be just as traumatized and upset asEren, Armin and the others are due to the fact that there are giant Titans eating all your friends and family. But its just not your typical anime characters. There is so much crying and a lot of the show is characters weeping about how terrible there life is, its just not the anime i am used to. Maybe, in a way thats what makes it better than most anime, the fact that characters show so much emotion. Instead of having a fearless character like Goku or Inuyasha you have characters who are scared and admit their fear.\\n\\nAttack on Titan is a wonderful story and I myself can not wait for Season 2. I give the first season a solid 9/10.',\n",
       " \"This review is spoiler free. The name''attack on titan'' might not seem that interesting. At first I thought, giant brainless creatures that eat humans? so what? But then it turned out definitely unregrettable. The story is hardcore (I believe one word is enough) and so is the soundtrack. Never have I ever seen a soundtrack that suits the story and the fight scenes that well, it litterly sends chills down your spine, which is why I rated it 10 (and I never give 10). As for the art and the charcters, I can honestly say the design is more realistic than anything else. I remember the firstepisode left me shaken because of the single thought that this could happen for real. However I hated the fact that so many characters died before we got to know them well. It didn't keep me from enjoying it anyway, though you would rethink the definition of enjoyement after watching this anime. Shingeki No Kyojin is definitely not something for the soft hearted or those who easily get attached to fictional characters (which is nothing to be ashamed of).\\n\\nJust to say, you might wanna watch this anime before you die.\",\n",
       " 'One thing I would like to say before anything else, don\\'t believe the hype. Starting off with the story. I find this right here to be half and half. As far as the background and history shown, and the world that was created I think it\\'s really good. I liked the idea of humanity living behind walls, drove to near extinction, finding the overall story of the world to be pretty original in anime. However, on the other side, as far as the actual, episode to episode, overall story of the season... I find it to be very lackluster. The show forces shock value down yourthroat, showing mass death almost every episode, to the point where it seems like the makers don\\'t know how to tell the story without throwing genocide or murders in every other episode. Aside from the forced shock value; there is barely anything worthwhile that happens in the story for the first season. Not to mention most of the season is composed of two 8+ episode arcs, which are very drawn out. I could go into much deeper reasons, but don\\'t want to spoil anything.\\n\\nThe art style and sound are both pretty decent. I find the art style pretty unique, although when it comes to the sound, aside from the first opening of the series I find the remaining themes pretty generic. The first opening does pump you up and in my opinion blinds people into thinking the show is going to be \"super epic\".\\n\\nNow for the characters... I am not kidding when I say that the main characters in this series are complete crap. Eren is definitely the most boring main character, compared to a lot of others; I hated Sword Art Online but I thought even Kirito was more interesting than Eren. All Eren does is shout and preach, like he\\'s the center of everything but has barely anything to back that up. And aside from his titan-related trait there\\'s nothing else to him. I find Mikasa an empty character who only lives for Eren, who makes it seem like she can\\'t even think for herself without him there. The only thing she has going for her is bad ass action scenes with her, which delude people into not looking past that and seeing a shallow character. And then there\\'s Armin, who is a complete pussy and useless for the first 7-8 before he slowly starts becoming useful; most of the time he\\'s shown he\\'s either whining or showing how incompetent he is. He does get better down the road, and out of the three characters his is probably the best.\\n\\nAttack on Titan is apparently hailed as \"The Best anime of 2013\" and some going as far as saying \"The Best Anime Ever!\" When in reality, no. A lot of its\\' fans make it seem like that you have to fall head over heels for it, and act like if you think it\\'s bad then you don\\'t know what good anime is.\\n\\nNot saying this isn\\'t a bad show, but I find it majorly flawed, and wish that more people would sit down and really think about this show before they praise it like they do. In my honest, serious opinion, I really am concerned about people who claim it to be the best anime of 2013.',\n",
       " \"The best way I can think of describing my experience with this show is that I found it profoundly uninteresting. So much so that I find myself in a position of being genuinely unable to understand why it is so well regarded. Which is unusual for me - I can usually understand the appeal of something even if I don't care for it myself. Perhaps the biggest issue that I find with it is that the cast consists largely of shallow stock characters. For me this is what really kills the anime, I think. I just couldn't find it in myself to care about anything thathappened because of them. This wouldn't necessarily completely sink an anime on its own, though it would have to have some pretty significant strengths in other areas to make up for it, and Attack on Titan doesn't seem to have any. The story of a young man being given responsibility over the fate of mankind due to a plot contrivance giving him sole access to or rare talent in some kind of great power is a very common one in anime, and within the first season this show does very little to mix it up at all. The tone is pretty consistently bleak, with levity being rare and unfortunately rather poorly implemented when it does appear, but for an anime that's so lacking in depth or original thought this just serves to make it even more boring. \\n\\nIts being so depthless and unoriginal is exactly why I find it difficult to understand why people are so interested in it. What about this show makes it apparently so much better than the mountain of other anime that have used the exact some concept and used it, to my mind, just as well? I suppose it could be the fight scenes, which are fine, though not particularly noteworthy if you ask me. Or perhaps the consistency of tone, which is honestly rare in anime and consequently kind of refreshing even if it doesn't really help the show much. But then I guess that the reason I'm writing this is because I don't know why this show is popular, so I certainly don't have any confidence in either of those guesses. If you enjoyed this show, don't hesitate to tell me what you thought was good about it. I'm honestly interested to know. For now though, I'm scoring it a five out of ten - I'm completely apathetic toward it. Because it does nothing at all unusual it can neither be said to be at all good or really at all bad. It's just mediocre, which when you get down to it is really the worst thing to be. I certainly don't intend to watch any future episodes of this anime.\",\n",
       " \"I've watched a lot of other anime and this still stands as my number 1 top favorite anime. Story is well written and intense. Art is a little dull but it is still great. And the music is beyond outstanding. I love how the opening themes deliver a great message about humanity. And the soundtrack playing during the episodes just add to the intensity. There was at least some character development in it. But I enjoyed every second of it and no matter how many times I rewatch this I still enjoy it. I also do recommend thatyou read the manga.  The anime leaves a few things out that are only in the manga.  And will answer a lot of your questions about the anime.\",\n",
       " 'Shingeki no Kyojin is an anime adaptation of the manga which won Kodansha Manga Award on the shounen category in 2011 and the utmost representative flag why kids nowadays will always prefer awesome action scenes instead good characters in a good story (we vidya now lads). I try to at least be as objective as possible with these reviews, but in this case I can\\'t not mention the constant annoyance the main character and his constant angsting about the things that happened in the first episode. Jesus Christ, his whole existence revolves around angst. Realistic portrayals of characters do not just use one aspectof them and blatter us over the head with that non-stop. There needs to be at least one high-moment to correlate all of the low moments. If he is in constant angst-mode and always shouting, it becomes meaningless and more of a joke or a running gag.\\n\\nNow I know. It is shounen. What do I even expect? But the straw of thinking too deep into it doesn\\'t work this time, because even when you scratch the surface of these characters, they still seem to be completely uninteresting. There is no concept worth exploring here, no good idea hooking you to the adventure and what is there, is boring after a few episodes. \\nMost of the things like character-motivation, their development and the pacing just seem quite off. The characters like Eren, Mikasa and Armin are completely one dimensional and void of almost any interesting aspect. \\n\\nUp front, the more time passes between me, having watched the show and now thinking about it, the more average it becomes. I came to the conclusion, that the show severely lacks memorable moments. Many may call BS on me for that, but really think about it. Excluding what happens in Episode eight...I think, there was almost nothing for me to remember fondly. I\\'ll say, that upon first completing the show, I quite liked it and would have even called it good, but that is just not the case anymore. \\n\\nAlso as enjoyment it\\'s quite nice, but \"Enjoyment\" rating shouldn\\'t be one of the aspects when making an impartial review and this is pretty much why 99% of MAL reviews are bad. There\\'s plenty good stuff you could watch instead getting into this. After 1st season It gets insufferable -opinion even among the fans- so if you like action scenes just watch an american movie already.',\n",
       " 'Please read the Review first before marking it as “Helpful” or “Not Helpful” One thing I´ve been noticing in the past few years is that new anime releases are lacking on originality and a serious plot, so when Shingeki no Kyojin or if you prefer Attack on Titan first came out I had all sorts of mixed feelings towards it, but this feeling of relief was always present on me. Attack on Titan is one of those anime that even non regular anime viewers praise, but does Titan lives up to all its Hype surrounding it or it just stays as Attack on Hypu? Setting/Plot:7.5\\nI will try to not drag out for too much in this part even though Attack on Titan has a very big premise, when humanity is no longer at the top of the food chain because of what they refer as Titans who resemble giant people varying from 4m class to a big ass 60m class have putted humans at border of extinction. Now humans only option is to live cornered in this 3 gigantic walls Maria, Rose and Sina. This situation creates a lot of limitations for humans such as their resources and their live space. On a first look the plot doesn´t look that amazing or original, but it doesn´t just stop there as the majority of people think, no, the world of Attack on Titan is much bigger than that delivering complex themes such as new religions, monarchic government, new social ideals, etc.  \\n\\nSo the anime follows Eren a kid that has always been curious of the outside world, he has always had this motivation to join the Scouting Legion, accompanying him there´s Mikasa and his friend Armin. When suddenly a Colossal Titan appears with what they call the Armor Titan breach over the walls that have protected them for their whole lives, letting minor titans enter the wall and start chaos, the outcome of this event had Eren seeing her mother get eaten by a Titan which starts Eren journey to obliterate the Titans!\\n\\nArt/Animation: 8.5\\nI personally was a bit concerned with this at first; Attack on Titan was produced by Studio Wit. As a new studio it’s usual that they start with less ambitious projects and I was preoccupied if they could handle a promising show like Titan; they went totally beyond my expectations! \\nDon´t get me wrong, it had decent animation, but when it needed to exceed their potential they did, that´s why SnK has God given action scenes! \\nAs it for the artstyle I can say it has a different aspect looking a bit more cartoonish than most of the anime, I´m not saying this is good or bad it just depends on your taste. Also this combined with a world filled with medieval atmosphere does work pretty well. The animation is one of the remarkable things about Titan, with this you can notice their high production value played a great part on the anime because if just help to deliver the viewers a more realistic environment to what´s happening. \\n\\n\\nSoundtrack: 9\\nYou know that a soundtrack is good not just when it helps building up the atmosphere but when it becomes memorable, that is what attack on titan OST´s delivered to me. The OST does not reach the “eargasm” levels for me but it surely is one of the greats.  I also have to give them props for the voice casting, it just was right on spot with honorable mentions to Kamiya Hiroshi casting for Rivaille and Inoue Marina casting for Armin both with remarkable performances, being honest the whole cast has done an amazing performance!\\n\\nCharacters: 7\\nNow I come to the weakest part of the anime, I will just limit myself to talk about the main cast not because other characters are not important or I dislike them, is because anybody aside from the main cast of characters can die, even the coolest character if he´s not from the main cast he´s probably just there for the meat fest. This is really sad because there´s much more cooler characters the anime can focus on that don´t get that much screen time =(\\n\\nEren Yeager: Eren is our lead protagonist in the series, starting out being a character with a great determination that also felt very cliché with this “I´ll swear vengeance “thing. Although he has a great determination he sometimes turns out to be useless at times, even though he has this special something inside him……. \\n\\nMikasa Ackerman: Probably the best out of the three leads, Mikasa, is presented to us as a strong character not just physically but also emotionally. She also has this abnormal attachment towards the main lead Eren. She also takes part on some of the best scenes of the anime, just portraying how epic she can be.\\n\\nArmin Arlert: Last but not least we have Armin, which for me is the one who gains more development throughout the anime being from a total pussy to a mastermind who leads important operations for humanity.\\n\\nEnjoyment:9\\nAttack on Titan surely shows some remarkable work in a lot of its categories, but still is not perfect as people claim it to be it does enough to keep you eager to know what will happen next! Attack on Titan does not lifts up to all its Hype but this doesn´t mean that it fails to do a remarkable and enjoyable anime!\\nOverall: 8.5',\n",
       " \"To tease the madness and the grief To curse the walls, to cure the need To curse the damned who damn the need The need to know what lies beyond, beyond the walls [1] Shingeki no Kyojin is the 12th best and 18th most popular anime ever. This might sound sarcastic, but hear me out. The idea is simple, yet the best ever because no one has done it before. Titans want to eat humans. Humans don't want to be eaten. Insert shit tons of action and blood and other cool shit ??? == anime of the century. The story itself is about this guy Eren who wants tobeat some titans ass. 5 episodes later he beats some titans ass. 10 episodes later everything is titans ass, and I don't know what the fuck, but it's pretty good. There is also this 9/10 chick Mikasa who is pretty, then cute, then sexy, then slutty, then hot. So the series definitely has character development.\\n\\nThe adaption relies on production values and yelling. We have action scenes, fight scenes, titan ass action scenes, titan ass fight scenes and action titan ass fight scenes. Blood, gore and flying body parts. Hot chicks, cool badass characters, insane and out of a mind coolfucks who are ON OUR SIDE. Ridiculously evil villains who just won't learn before main character kicks their ass! This is what I call quality entertainment. \\n\\nThe voice acting is bloody impressive. Eren yells louder than any other  shonen protagonist. He has ideologies and people need to hear it. I personally love these scenes. It's not that the loudest voice is always right, but when someone cares to shout it out loud that loud, you just gotta admit that the man has a point. \\n\\nThe music is fucking A. Even Mozar would say so. Whoever created the first Opening song is genius for writing a song which goes perfectly with anything and everything. This could be the OP of every anime and tv series ever made and people would say; Oh, boy, that is very fitting song. \\n\\nShingeki no Kyojin creates what all people who work in the entertainment business aim at: entertainment. Not just any entertainment, but some serious titans-ass-getting-beaten-while-blood-flies entertainment, and that's why it is the 12th best anime ever. \\n\\n\\nSauces \\n[1] Rishloo, Eidolon, 04 Pandora\",\n",

       " 'Shingeki no Kyojin or Attack on Titan is perhaps one of the most overrated shows I have seen. Don\\'t get me wrong, it is well worth your time, it just has been overblown by fans whose previous anime experience is most likely limited to Naruto and Bleach. Naturally this is all my own opinion, and feel free to completely disregard it. Let me get one thing straight though, this show is an excellent gateway for people trying to get into anime. If you know someone who wants to get started then this is perfect. Right so the story and setting are as follows. In aworld that resembles medieval Europe with little sprinkles of Steam Punk throughout, humanity has been forced to seclude itself in regions surrounded by heavily fortified and immense walls up to 50 meters high. Why you ask? To protect themselves from the Titans, giant docile humanoids that simply eat all humans they encounter and no one knows why. These Titans range in classes of  sizes with some being only 5 meters tall to the special types like the Colossal Titan who himself reaches up to 60 meters. \\nSo one average day where no trouble could possibly arrive from, the Colossal Titan and his friends the \"Armored Titan\" and the rest of the titan gang destroy the wall guarding our main protagonist Eren Jaeger\\'s (pronounced \"Yaeger\") city and basically makes him have a bit of a difficult day to say the least. From here on he and his two friends Armin and Mikasa vow to destroy all Titans while they still live by join the military.\\n\\nWhile the story and setting are indeed very intriguing and keep the viewer guessing, they suffer from some pacing issues where something that seems to be important gets disregarded and other events drag on for a bit too long in my opinion. I watched the show as it aired and the animation studio behind it \"Studio Wit\" did a great job and ended each episode with a cliffhanger making the week between each episode a tense and one that could not go any faster. However, there were some times where these cliffhangers felt rather cheap as the next episode would quickly wrap up the issue within the first  minute or so. \\nI have to give props to the manga writer Hamjime Isayama for creating such a fresh setting that really pulls away from traditional fantasy. The 3D maneuver  gear which the military use to fight titans are awesome gadgets that provide some of the best scenes in the show. Also the constant oppressive feeling that Attack on Titan delivers really succeeds in making you anxious about the future for this show. Hope always seems to cave in on itself. \\n\\nMy main issue with Shingeki no Kyojin is its characters. Going on the internet one will see that many fans of the show compare it to \"Game of Thrones\" for the show\\'s ruthlessness regarding character deaths. This is true and in my opinion is meant to commended, however for that to be effective, one needs to care about the people dying. In all honesty I couldn\\'t give a damn about the characters in this show, none are in any way interesting or go outside the common stereotypes found in anime.\\n In the 25 or so episodes of the show, the characters and their motives don\\'t change since the first 2. Even the three main characters can be summed in one sentence by the end of the show. Eren is pissed off and hates Titans cause they killed someone precious to him. Mikasa is obviously in love with Eren and wants to protect him. Finally Armin is a guy too scared to fight first hand but has excellent strategic plans. \\nThe other side characters are barely worth a mention, even Levi who all the fans seem to fantasize over for being \"badass\" is just a sadistic douche. Admittedly he does demonstrate some serious ass whooping skill in the show, and that I have to give credit for.\\nWithout naming anyone, a person dies fairly early on in the show and every other character kept going on about how they miss them and they shouldn\\'t have died. Truth be told, I didn\\'t even know who the hell they were till much later in the anime. \\nI sincerely hope season 2 of Attack on Titan develops these characters more.\\n\\nOkay so enough hating on AoT for now, lets talk about the positives. Well for one, the art and animation. Studio Wit are a brand new studio whose first production is this show. I can only say that they must be comprised of artistic gods! The animation here is seriously the best I have ever seen in any anime. Many people complained about still shots being used during episode downtime particularly early in the show but Wit make up for it by delivering some of the most spectacular action scenes I have witnessed. There is something truly jaw dropping about seeing people zip around cityscapes in their 3D Maneuver Gear. I cannot compliment the animation and art in this anime enough.\\n\\nThe music is also excellent. Composer Hiroyuki Sawano (also composed the soundtrack fro Kill la Kill) does an incredible job of emphasizing the setting with sombre and slow melodies accompanied by a some beautiful german singing to elevate the darker scenes in the show. Some pumping electronic sounds mixed with grand and epic choirs also get the hairs on your back standing for the more action heavy scenes. \\n\\nAll in all Shingeki no Kyojin is well worth your watch. While I don\\'t think the characters will find their own space in your heart (not with Eren\\'s constant whining), I do believe you will have a great time with this show, especially is you are a lover of action. I myself am incredibly excited for season 2 and severely hope that they fix up some issues with the plot and characters then. \\nIf you are going to watch, avoid the manga spoilers like the plague! \\n\\nThank you for your time.',\n",
       " \"Well I've read the manga a while ago, but never did I think it would get an anime adaptation this awesome. Story 10/10: Although it does have a few cliches seen in many shonen, it is otherwise completely original, suspenseful and will have you on the edge of your seat every episode. Assuming the anime follows the manga faithfully, you are all in for many incredible twists!!!! Look forward for it, I can't wait. Characters 9/10: Although only 2 episodes have been released, the character development is incredible. The 3 main characters should and most likely will be fleshed out wonderfully in the anime (if going bythe manga), their back-stories are quite good/surprising/original.\\n\\nAnimation 9/10: What more is there to say?\\n\\nOverall: This anime will most likely be the best of the season, it certainly had the best first episode of any anime I've watched, and there's no doubt production values will be on the high side. Here's hoping for another season after the first 25 episodes! Enjoy watching, it won't disappoint.\\nless\",\n",
       " \"I remember hearing about an anime called Attack on Titan (Shingeki no Kyojin) and it's huge popularity when it's first season originally aired. Naturally, I looked into it, watching a trailer and reading a description, etc, and found myself unimpressed (even turned off) by what I saw. Something about those giants with their ridiculous grins and overall appearance did absolutely nothing for me. Now, two years later, and a sudden passion to catch up on my exponentially-growing backlog of anime, I finally decided to give this series an honest try. After all, it must have gained all this popularity for a reason, right?From the very first episode, I was blown away.  Aside from the giants (or titans, as they are called), I found the artwork and animations fantastic, with the CG interwoven beautifully.  There was an instant, heartfelt connection to the main characters.  And the music was exceptional.  \\n\\nI had to have more, and more I did have, finishing the first season in only three days.  Overall, I couldn't have been much more pleased with Shingeki no Kyojin, and regret not having given it a chance sooner.  Out of 25 episodes, I found only one or two of only moderate value, while all the rest kept me on the edge of my seat with a mix excitement, shock, fear, grief, anticipation and awe.\\n\\nIt didn't take long at all to get used to the odd appearance of the titans, and even came to my own understanding of their purpose for it.  Outside of that, my only real complaints are story-related, in the sense that I just have so many unanswered questions (especially not having read the manga).  But the series isn't over after all, and I'm sure that the majority of my questions will get answered in the next season.\\n\\nShingeki no Kyojin is almost non-stop action sequences and gut-wrenching emotional rollercoasters. Any anime that can thoroughly pull me into its world and make me so emotionally invested in its characters is a success in my book.\\n\\nI may have misjudged this anime initially, but next time, when season two airs, I'm going to be one of the first in line to see it!\",\n",
       " 'When I look at the rankings of this anime, I am quite surprised. I was almost certain based on the praising reviews that was going to be a great anime revival show. I thought wrong. Highlights: START: extremely strong start, such a powerful first episode that immediately drew me into the show. PRODUCTION: very well done, no question about it. If there is something good to say about Attack on Titan/Shingeki no Kyojin it is certainly the animation, music and sound. Crisp and perfect. The animation has entirely no flaws, and the background settings are gorgeously animated. The music was another great aspect of the show, setting thecorrect tone at all times.\\n\\nLowlights:\\n\\nCHARACTERS: super cliche, especially the main three characters: Eren, Mikasa, and Armin. The reason that they are cliche is because all they do the entire show is talk about how much they want to eliminate the Titans, not how they would do it, but merely that they were going to with no possible ideas of how. Another thing that bothered me throughout the entire show was instead of cooperating and working out tactics of eliminating Titans, all I could notice about the conversations were that it seemed just like a “who can wear out their voice enough until they can’t talk trash about the enemy any longer” contest.\\nFOCUS: based on the ending of the series, I came to the conclusion that the first 15 or so episodes were a pointless plot. There was a new goal to accomplish after the first 15 or so episodes, and that was what remained entirely in the show.\\nPACING: slower than a three-toed-sloth. I could not watch full episodes at times because it got so repetitive and boring.\\nMORALS: the show has no message, unless you count “when you get invaded by giant stupid naked people, fight back.” The show pretty much seemed very anti-peace, even at the end.\\n\\nSo if you want to see a highly produced show, go for Attack on Titan/Shingeki no Kyojin. However, if you are destined to watch an anime with greatly developed characters and a pointful plot, I wouldn’t recommend this one.',\n",
       " \"Just like a lot of people I suppose, I watched SNK to see what's the big deal about, as it wasn't in my list that season. It starts out with the shock factor. I thought, even though this isn't my kind of thing, I could maybe watch it for the suspense. But then it got into long cycles of boring and in my opinion, poorly executed character development scenes. As far as the story is concerned, I wouldn't say it's the most complex or sophisticated one, but they played the suspense/shock card very well, and it is something that can obviously attract a lot ofpeople.\\n\\nThis anime has very well crafted action scenes. However, because of that, most of the other scenes are poorly animated, to the extent where it looks like a student's flash animation project at times. Even putting that aside, I think the style of the animation as a whole is not particularly creative.\\n\\nIt is obvious why SNK is so popular, but it doesn't do it for me. I would say it's too much style over substance, and not meaning the animation style.\",\n",
       " 'Attack on titan Story- The story follows humanity’s struggle of survival as it hides behind the safety of 50 metre high walls that has protected them from anthropoid beings known as titans for over 100 years. These titans are mysterious in origin and are massive in size. Their only goal is to kill humanity for seemingly no reason. After 100 years of peace, a breach in the outer of the 3 walls caused by a mysterious, previously unseen 60 metre tall titan pushes humanity to a desperate situation. We thus follow the story of 3 teenagers, Eren, Armin and Mikasa and how they fit into thischaos. The first few episodes provide the viewer with an entirely new experience that will shock and change all you will naturally expect from an anime. \\n\\nThe first 7 episodes were pretty much the longest Holy shit!!! moments from what I have currently seen from an intro. But after this initial promise, the actual story unravels.\\n\\n Once everything settles down, the pace slows right down, the standard array of stereotypical characters are all introduced in 5 minutes and the story no longer develops. Humanity must kill the titans! Yup. That’s pretty much it. The very nature of the enemy limits the story to just that, the titans can’t talk, they have no morals. So all this anime can ever be is how Eren kills the titans. This is so unbelievably one dimensional it’s a joke. With only one end goal, there can only be a series of extremely predictable single battles against the titans. And all of these suffer some serious pace issues. In the middle of a fight, the anime would stop to hear everyone’s opinions. Or it would decide to watch countless flashbacks of traumatic family events. With the clear attraction of attack on titan being on the action, why bother showing this after we are all so pumped up?\\n\\n I have also read the supposed ending of the attack on titan anime series. My armpit has more creativity than that. Message me if you want the details. 4\\n\\nArt- this section is the most controversial in my books. Whilst the artwork is undoubtedly superb, i.e. the fight scenes and the environments, the underlying language of the artwork is flawed. Attack on titan is, as far as anime can be, very gory. People’s heads and limbs are flying everywhere. But fighting these grotesque beings are a group of 3 teenagers (of which Armin is apparently a boy) who all look like they’ve just worked out how to use a toilet. It’s like watching ash ketchum go ‘fuck you charizard!’ and watch him proceed to break his neck. It’s confusing. The design of the titans are, maybe intentionally, grotesque. But I am sure that there are better design potentials here. I’m pretty sure I saw Nicholas cage as one of the titans. 6\\n\\nSound- the soundtrack is amazing. Suitably epic and upbeat. But there is no other dimensional quality to the soundtrack. Even when the main character’s mum dies, an epic fight song is playing. The anime needs to learn, even in an action led story, more than action can exist. The beauty of friendships are poorly conveyed through the music for example.  The voice acting is the most over the top voice acting I have ever witnessed. It’s not, ‘can you pass me the water’, its ‘ (with lines and explosions encircling the character) I have failed you mother!!! I need the water to save my friends and to kill the titans!!!!!! Calm your tits already. Blimey. 7\\n\\nCharacters- defiantly not the strong point of attack on titan. The main character literally just wants to kill all titans to avenge his mother. A far more powerful character, Mikasa, starts of wanting to protect Eren, yet by the end, she wants to protect Eren even more! Wait, what? The only development we see is of Armin, who starts from a complete wussy to what you expect from a main character. All other characters just fulfil the stereotypical archetype that the writers have fallen for. It was so disappointing to see this after seeing such a unique beginning. 4\\n\\nEnjoyment- suffice to say, I did not enjoy attack on titan. I spent most of the time being frustrated by how slow it was all moving and how childish everything was. I was pulled in by the overwhelming popularity and amazing action scenes. What I was met with was a very childish attempt at making gore cool. Providing a lame excuse for teenagers to create a lot of carnage is not a good story. As awesome as the fight scenes were, they cannot make up for how immature it all is. 4\\n\\nOverall- I’m really sorry for all the attack on titan fans reading this. But I am 18 and I have outgrown this senseless, immature and shallow genre. Whether I recommend watching it, I would actually say yes. The first 7 episodes are actually amazing. But the initial rebelling against the norm was quickly ignored and it drifted back to an average anime. 5',\n",
       " 'Neon Attack Genesis on Evangelion Titan, or “Our Lawyers Made Us Change The Name of This Show So We Wouldn’t Get Sued” A deconstruction. Preface: You see, a guy named William Shakesman once said, “brevity is the soul of wit”, so I’m not going to waste anybody’s time with a garbage two sentence “OMG THIS IS THE BEST ANIMU EVAR I HEART EREN SO MUCH 10/10 EVERYTHING” review. Nope, you fanboys want the truth? You can’t handle the truth. But I’m gonna lay it out here for you anyway. I’m going to break this thing down into three parts. The “tropes lifted from every zombie media Setting”, the “clichéCharacters”, and the “Circuitous, Shonen Storytelling”. \\n-----\\n\\nThe Trope Filled, Every Zombie Media Setting\\n\\nA while back, monstrous humanoid giants hell-bent on destroying humans struck. All but a few thousand humans were wiped out, waging a futile war against an enemy they neither understood, nor knew how to fight. Present day, there\\'s one human settlement left, protected by three 50m high concentric walls, the largest among them 300 miles across, making it about the size of Germany. \\nOkay so, a little more info on these human killing giants, right? Because that was pretty vague. They have 3 qualities. \\n\\n1)They kill and eat humans. They do not need to eat humans for sustenance, they just do it because the plot demands it of them\\n\\n2)Nobody knows where they came from, or why, and it doesn’t matter. I’m sure there will be some BS pseudo-scientific explanation for their existence later, because these type of shows ALWAYS take one of three paths: \\n\\n-----\\n1.Scientists did this! Biological weapon/genetic mutation experiments, who cares? It’s all vaguely scientific and intellectual sounding, so that’ll fool the teen demographic\\n2.A Wild Virus Appeared! Some mutated microbe that’s unaffected by any drug affects all but some small number of populace who, by plot convenience, don’t contract the illness\\n3.Who the hell cares! Zombies are here and we have to shoot, maim, kill, and destroy them to survive! \\n-----\\n\\n4)They are notoriously hard to kill… you can hack and slash on them all day long and they’ll still swat you like flies. *whispers* wait, I’m getting some breaking news. You can KILL them by attacking the neck/head area, just like some other TV shows and movies involving the undead… hmmmmm\\n\\nTitans are just zombies. Face the facts. This is a zombie show. It premiered during the height of zombie craze, and through shrewd marketing and an impeccable sense of timing, a hit was born. Did it have to be substantive? Heck no, all it had to do was prey on these little fragile children’s emotions and “OH MY FEEEELZ” by killing off a few characters that we still know nothing about, nor formed any attachment to, along with throwing in a Gary Stu blank slate of a main character onto which these angsty teens can project themselves. \\n-----\\n\\nThe Stupid Setting Part II\\n\\nOh wait, did I say Germany? It’s plainly obvious that AOT is ripping off any and everything late medieval German Gothic and Renaissance styled architecture. Oh, and if the names and races of the characters didn’t give it away, I don’t know what would. Eren Jäger? Braun? Bertolt? Kirstein? Zoe Hänge? Also, it’s quite amazing how these characters all speak fluent Japanese, given that they’re all, except our token Asian character, Mikasa, German. Now wouldn’t that be an innovative anime- one with Deutsch spoken and subtitled in Japanese? \\n\\nNow that I’ve started listing names, it’s time to get to the \\n-----\\n\\nCliché Characters Section! \\n\\nWe\\'ve got the not-so-subtly named main character Eren I\\'m-Going-Kill-Titans-Don\\'t-Tell-Me-What-To-Do-You\\'re-Not-My-Dad Jäger, who\\'s hell-bent on the destruction of the oppressive titans who show up to wreck his life... talk about teen angst, sheesh. Eren’s sole means of expressing himself in this show is “GRRRRUUUAAAAHHHH I hate titans I’m going to kill them all!!! (in order to keep X tragedy from happening again, because remember kids, NO shonen protagonist is complete without family tragedy!)” \\nWait, where have we heard this before? What’s that? Every shonen series ever? \\nLet’s take a small cut from the block of trope that makes up the shonen genre, shall we?\\n\\nRin Okumura: “I’M GOING TO KILL EVERY DEMON, AND SATAN TO SAVE MY BROTHER!”\\nKazuto Kirigaya: “I’M GOING TO KILL ALL THE BADDIES TO SAVE MY FRIENDS!”\\nEd/Al Elric: “WE’RE GOING TO KILL ALL THE HOMUNCULI AND SAVE EVERYONE!”\\nShiro Emiya: “I’m not going to kill anyone, but I will SAVE EVERYONE!”\\nKen Kaneki agrees with Shiro, and they meet up with Shinji Ikari to hide. \\n-----\\n\\nMikasa My-Plot-Armor-Is-Stronk-But-My-Sword-Arm-Is-Stronger Ackermann is our leading lady. She personifies the Silent Strong type. She only says two lines in the whole show: “Eren you idiot, I always have to save you because you’re the main character and you can’t die!”\\nAnd “Why did I sign up for this job, again?”\\n-----\\n\\nRounding out our trio, we have He-Man\\'s midget brother, Armin I-Use-My-Mind-Not-My-Muscles Arlert. He’s also hiding out with Shinji and Ken.\\n\\nWhen someone dies in this show, it’s like watching someone kick a little puppy. They show you some little scene about the character and their life before, and how they’re never going to go home to hug mom and their fish are going to starve now because they’re not going to be around to feed them. We never get any attachment to characters who die because they’re never given enough screentime to be relevant, or anyone we should care about. Of course, nobody that matters to the plot dies, either. \\n-----\\n\\n\\nJust when you thought this was about to get into some “Circuitous, Shonen Storytelling!”, HERE COMES THE “Circuitous, Shonen Storytelling!”\\n\\nAttack on Titan isn’t a 700 episode series like Detective Conan or One Piece… yet. With this pace though, and the ever intangible, nebulous goal (straight ripping off the fantastic David Fincher movie, “Se7en”) of “WHAT’S IN THE BASEMENT, MANNNN?” Otaku on Titan takes a turn for the molasses. \\nWhen it isn\\'t taking a 3 episode sabbatical of dialogue (in typical shonen fashion), the show does move pretty quickly… to boredom. If you’re not getting angsty teens shouting at each other over why they have to kill stuff, or that they don’t want to do it anymore, or crying over their lives; it’s them killing stuff, then crying about their lives. \\n\\nI didn’t forget to remember to mention that AOT is just a cheap ripoff of Neon Genesis Evangelion, did I?\\nPlot basics: \\n1)Humanity fights an enemy it doesn’t understand, is whittled down to a tiny populace, and is poorly equipped to handle the threat, until one day… A HERO EMERGES!\\n2)Hero has daddy problems. Hero’s female sidekick(s) also have parent problems\\n3)Hero loses loved ones which causes them to have to fight, even if they don’t want to\\n4)Conspiracy!\\n-----\\n\\nHere it is. I committed the ultimate sin and rated the beloved Attack on Titan a 5. \"Why? why would you do this, LawlMartz?\" \"Why would you give Shingeki no Kyojin a paltry 5 and not the 10 it so effortlessly achieved and deserves??\" they ask me. To this, my answer is simple. “Children, Attack on Titan is like any movie made by Marvel/Disney recently- sure, it\\'s fun, it looks nice, and the masses love it, but at the end of the day, you didn’t see anything new and it didn’t leave a lasting impression on you, other than how immensely angsty it was.”\\n\\nAttack on Titan is honestly just too vanilla to really hate. It borrows from countless other shonen before it, and puts all the tropes in one pot, and comes out the anime equivalent of a hot dog… pretty good if you have no expectations or never had one before… but then you want something better afterwards.\\n\\nLet’s just call it Otaku on Titan and call it a day.',\n",
       " 'When I first saw this anime, I was utterly blown away. Not only did it prove to show that there is still hope in the anime scene not disappointing you with redundant, repetitive, milked out fan serviced themes but it does so with a main character that happens to be the least irksome to one\\'s taste. The story talks about the last remnants of humanity cooped up behind amazingly huge walls protecting them from gigantic monsters known as Titans. You are introduced to the main characters: Eren Jaeger, Mikasa Ackerman, and Armin Arlert who are childhood friends that innocently dream of going beyond the walls anddiscovering the real world out there (just like any kid would!) This peaceful setting is disrupted when, out of the blue, a huge 60 foot Titan peeks from behind the 50 feet walls right at the puny humans and goes ahead to kick the gate that is sheltering humanity from the woes of the outside world that the Titans inhabit, wide open. \\n\\nThis is where the story starts to unfold around the mystery surrounding these Titans and why they are adamant on \"eating\" humanity as a whole.\\n\\nAll throughout every episode you will find yourself attached to every single character from here onwards. Some unceremoniously die, some have naive thoughts and goals to what they should do in life,  some want to take the easy way out of their strife, and some just go with the flow because they don\\'t think they are strong-willed to fight back. All in all you will be attached to characters that exhibit real human qualities.\\n\\nSimple concept for a story, isn\\'t it? Nope it ain\\'t.\\n\\nThis isn\\'t your run-of-the-mill monster/horror/doomed humanity anime. People fail to realize that the Attack on Titan setting is exactly the same setting we all live in our real lives. It reminds you that anyone who is bigger, better, and stronger will not only devour you whole, but will also devour your entire dreams, hopes, and future with it.\\n\\nAnd this main character, Eren Jaeger...this kid, you actually root for this wide eyed enthusiastic little bugger - who adamantly with all his heart wants to turn the tide whether it be for better or for worse. He knows that he has to FIGHT in order to go anywhere in life, and he isn\\'t letting these monsters ruin his will to live; his will to take matters into his own hands.\\n\\nIt\\'s very rare to have a character pump you up. It serves to show how willpower alone can do wonders - even if you are only human.\\n\\nThe art is absolutely breathtaking. The colors are so vivid and you honestly can\\'t get enough of the lush background scenes. The action sequences were awesomely superb, especially with the surprisingly fluid 3D Maneuver Gear sequences. As for the characters the first thing you will notice are the EYES. They are so vividly colored and illustrated you can\\'t help but find yourself drawn to them.\\n\\nThe music is simply outstanding. It fits very well with the mood of the story. Starting from the opening sequence to the ending credits. The BGM and SFX were especially very well placed whenever a character is seen flying around using the 3D Maneuver Gear. The ambiance and that feeling of dread that emanates from the music captures you from the very first episode. Honestly, if anyone hates the music I will royally Jaeger your ass!\\n\\nUnlike the manga, the anime didn\\'t do justice or make way for any sort of character development. First timers wouldn\\'t be THAT drawn to the characters from the get-go. But the development is still there, you just need to look closely. Yep, closer....OH there it is!  I do hope that everyone reading this review would give them a fleeting chance if any. If you\\'re still not convinced, then go ahead and read the manga. You will be equally blown away, anyways.\\n\\nI haven\\'t enjoyed an anime like this in a very long while. As I said in the very beginning of the review, animes nowadays have only cliched themes and seem to just bring out a yawn rather than any hint of interest. I\\'ve been so picky that I almost did not watch Attack on Titan (*GASP* the blasphemy!) \\n\\nIt epically portrayed a lot of simple concepts and elements that are most importantly HUMAN. It teaches you how easy it is to have hope inch further and further away from your grip and how easy it is to just give up. Though if no one around you is willing to stand tall and face adversity, it doesn\\'t mean that YOU have to be scared out of your wits too.\\n\\nI urge everyone to watch Attack on Titan...then go ahead and read the manga, because if you\\'ll be as hooked as I am then I\\'m sure you wouldn\\'t even be able to bear waiting for the second season to come around the corner. \\n\\nHappy Jaegering!',\n",
       " \"It took me a while to start watching this for some reason. Finally got into it the other night, and I'm really not sure where all the praise is coming from. By episode 14 I was thoroughly engaged with the story and the characters. Sooo, what happened? I don't know the exact episode, maybe 16 or 17, but this show comes to a grinding halt. The story literally goes no where, the characters become stale and boring, and the main character, who was a thorough badass, actually regresses into an indecisive child. The show also has no ending. I mean I understand if they're planninganother season, but even so, it just ends abruptly with no resolution whatsoever. They throw a subplot in that occupies that last 5 or so episodes, and it goes absolutely nowhere. It was quite frustrating, as it all seemed very irrelevant.  \\n\\nIt was a good show, but not great. It didn't deliver in the end, as the story never really progresses once Eren joins the Survey Corp, and the characters never really go anywhere (and actually regress). There is only one really great scene in the second half of the show (church getting stomped on), and while it does deal with interesting themes, it's not enough to give it more than a 7.\",\n",
       " 'PROLOGUE Attack on Titan (AOT hereon) was the most overhyped title of its year, pretty much like Madoka Magica and Sword Art Online (SAO) were in the years right before it. And just like those, it did not live up to its hype, as pretty much no show ever does. It was a high seller that was talked about for some time, and eventually ended up being a big disappointment. And yes, I have read the manga so I know what I am talking about regarding later plot twists. Just like it happens with all overhyped mediocrities, the thing that made it so famous is the premise.A setting where mankind is almost wiped out by giant monstrosities and gets cornered behind huge walls, only for a giant to break down their fortifications and let the monsters into civilian areas. Terror and death spread as people die defenceless by the thousands and the rest retreat to other fortified lands where they work almost as slaves because of overpopulation and lack of food. From this description you are presented with a most interesting action / survival / horror, very graphical and doesn’t hold back in depicting gore, as the giants chew and swallow people. You are really intrigued to find out how people can survive against these monsters.\\n\\nSounds amazing enough for anyone to jump into the show, but surely not because it is original. It is actually quite basic and overdone; there have been several similar stories over the years, from Blue Gender to Claymore. Heck, the very same studio made Owari no Seraph and Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress, which have the exact same premise. The truth is, AOT came out at a time when 90% of anime were effortless softporn and moe; so it stood out. If it was made along with Death Note or Code Geass, it would only get a fraction of its hype. Also, the zombie apocalypse fad was still going strong in the west, and people were craving for something similar to The Walking Dead and hopefully not as trashy as Highschool of the Dead. Also, it is not a harem with schools that pretends to be deep and serious by having an apocalyptic story that is there as nothing but a fancy backdrop, like in the cases of Chrome Shelled Regios or Total Eclipse.\\n\\nThe main problems are still present though; so let’s go over them, one by one.\\n\\n1. AOT is a SHONEN, oozing with coolness and not a mature or sensible SEINEN\\n\\nThat translates to lots of eye-rolling moments. It is NOT a mature story despite having mature themes; and if some think otherwise they are simply ignorant. It’s all here, the cheesy dialogue, the 1-dimensional characterization, and the overused shonen shenanigans. The enemy seems undefeatable at first but then some obnoxious emo teenagers get convenient superpowers and defeat them by the dozens. That’s right; everyone has jutsus and hidden evil powers inside them, just like in Naruto. And don’t give me any excuses of the sort “There is no other way such a story could be told.” I have read manga such as Biomeat Nectar, Parasyte, and Dragon Head, where you have a pretty similar situation and they didn’t have any of the crap that happens every 5 minutes in this show. Because those were not shonen.\\n\\n2. Characterization is quite basic and even laughable at points despite the attempts to make the cast mature and serious.\\n\\nTake the protagonist for example. Remember Naruto and how he always screams “I WILL SAVE SASUKE DATEBAYO!” every 5 minutes to the point you want to strangle him? Well this one here is not any better since all he does is yelling “I WILL DEFEAT ALL THE GIANTS DATEBAYO!” It has that irritating always-angry, totally-stupid shonen thing you find pretty much everywhere and no amount of dramatic backdrop manages to make him anything more than that. Also, his backdrop did not form his personality, as he was BORN angry; he did not become angry because of the titans. And just like all typical shonen heroes he has special powers, special family, special friends, is plot armoured, and in general has everything working to his favour despite being nothing but yet another ill-mannered youth. But hey, we gotta pamper our main audience somehow and this effortless stereotype works just fine; so why try harder?\\n\\nOther characters include:\\n- An aloof girl who loves potatoes and talks like a retard; because all shows need a comic relief idiot.\\n- A local aristocrat who exists to show what a selfish asshole he is, letting everyone die just so he can escape with his money and not thinking about it twice; since as we all know adults in shonen are all assholes and only teenagers are the goodhearted folks who do all the work and save the day.\\n- Kidnapers who kill and sell people as prostitutes, just so we can hate them and wish them dead 10 seconds after they are introduced.\\n- Some scaredy cat boy who is always crying and panicking, just to show how cool is everyone else. Worthless and irritating as Reki from Claymore and yet another proof of why this show is not better than Claymore. They pretend he is a mastermind when it comes to planning ahead, but in reality he is the only one who sometimes thinks, while everyone else is an oblivious idiot. So technically he is a normal guy surrounded by retards.\\n- And let’s not forget the protagonist’s “not-blood-related-sister” who seems WAY too interested in him to the point she can’t exist without being a needy pet with constant withdrawal syndrome and half her screen time consists of yelling his name. How else would we have the obligatory brother-sister love thingy going on? Very mature, indeed.\\n\\nYou can literally describe most of them in 10 words as the way they talk and act will border a slapstick comedy half the time. Everything they need to express, they do it by yelling or crying like maniacs, even when the situation hardly calls for them to act as such. Or when they try to be serious for a change, it still comes off as comical. You see a guy in the first episode giving the severed hand of a dead soldier to his crying mother while saying with a serious face “This is all we could salvage. And by the way, your son died for nothing. HERP!” Lol man, what kind of a military leader is this guy? Was that supposed to make me feel sad? I am laughing at it.\\n\\nYou may be fooled to think they have depth, since most of them get flashbacks full of tragic childhood moments and stuff; but let’s be honest, all secondary characters in shows like Naruto and Bleach have those too and they are still nothing but cardboards to the story and eventually one dimensional archetypes instead of real people. AOT is not any different, as each of them is there just to cry in a corner, show us his tragic past and then go to fight the giants until he realizes he is completely worthless before the hax skills of the main characters and simply stops caring afterwards. Literally all secondary characters are nerfed or killed-off a few episodes after they are introduced.\\n\\n3. SHHHHOOOOOCK FACTOOOOORRRR\\n\\nSomething rather un-shonen for the time it came out, was the numerous deaths of secondary characters. Not many convenient survivals and resurrections here; if you are caught by a giant, he is going to rip you to pieces and eat you while you are still alive and screaming. That makes the tension ten-fold compared to an average shonen where everybody survives impossible situations. That still doesn’t save it in the longrun of course, since it is nothing but SHOCK FACTOR to make the audience gasp with blood and violence and not some actually tragic death of important characters you will never forget. You only notice the gore and not the people experiencing it. I will never forget the Nanto fighters in Hokuto no Ken because they were part of the plot and did far more than being emo in a corner before kicking the bucket. These here? Who are they? You will forget them 5 seconds after they are dead. Even the novelty of the high mortality rate lost its edge once shows like Akame GA Kill, Knights of Sidonia, and Fate Zero did the exact same thing soon afterwards. Not even that feels special anymore.\\n\\n4. Plot Armoured (Titan?)\\n\\nAnd despite the high mortality rate, eventually you realize it is something that counts only for secondary characters. They serve only as cannon fodder in this show; they exist just to cry in corners, die miserably, and fool the unexpected to think no one is safe. The major ones on the other hand, get the usual shonen package: Plot armoured with hax powers, like Wolverine’s super fast regeneration and Spiderman’s super fast agility, to forever survive any giant attack. They are oozing with the rule of cool and dwarf everybody else in importance, thus trashing the whole survival / horror aspect. The audience cheers for them, as they wipe out armies of undefeatable (for everybody else) giants, thus there is no tension. It is still all about who is more overpowered and cool, like in any run of the mill shonen. The tragic parts also become meaningless, since it all comes down to the usual magic superpowers and poser fighting, as in the case of, again, any run of the mill action shonen.\\n\\n5. The mystery aspect is quite weak\\n\\nHalf the interest most show in this anime derives from the gore (which is cheap and eventually shallow) and the other half is the mystery of the unworldly enemies (which fades away as soon as it is eventually revealed). At first you are thrilled to find out why the giants are eating people. They don’t need food to sustain themselves. They don’t have a personality or even intelligence which makes them grotesque and terrifying because you cannot understand their motivations. Well, most of your questions won’t be answered in this season, and the eventual explanation in a later arc only serves to make you realize there wasn’t much to it. OH HEY, THEY ARE JUST ZOMBIES, WHO COULD HAVE KNOWN! So even if you are watching this for the thrilling emotions, you are bound to hate it after you realize it wasn’t that good to begin with. It pretends to be far more than a most basic zombie apocalypse scenario. The city is the mall, the titans are the undead, and the steampunk spidermen are the people trying to survive.\\n\\n6. Weak world-building\\n\\nIt is full of interesting ideas as far as the setting goes, from detailed maps of how the human lands are run, to blueprints of how their cannons and steam engines that make them fly work. Later on you get even basic politics and religious fanatism as the people react to the new giant attacks and all of a sudden some kids get hax powers. It makes it far more interesting than some generic RPG world full of fortified cities and wilderness crawling with monsters. It’s not TOO detailed though; most of them are there for show since they don’t matter much in the longrun. You think those rotating cannons, the titanium swords, or the steampunk spidermen do shit against the giants? All you need is a few angsty teens with hax superpowers nobody else can beat if they work hard all their lives. And even if you just stick to the setting itself, it is quite simple despite its secondary details. The whole world is basically either houses where people live in, or wilderness where titans roam around. Many claim that since the story is a slowly-revealed mystery, it is excused when everything is so basic. It still doesn’t change the fact that the human land looks like 3 perfectly drawn homocentric circles and later on it’s just a flipped world map with undeveloped empires. Even a baby can do better than this.\\n\\n7. Slow pacing\\n\\nThe early episodes have extremely fast pacing but then it snails down to almost a halt. The first five minutes go wasted on summaries of things we saw just in the previous episode, and there are even recap episodes for events that don’t need more than a few minutes to describe. In a way this is a positive trait since it invests time in letting the viewer immerse in the mood of the show. Much better to running through the events while leaving everyone and everything unfocused or not looked into. Sadly, the mood is the only thing they focus on. Not much time is used to flesh out the characters or the setting, and in the longrun all secondary cast and the funky steampunk technologies are meaningless.\\n\\n8. Overused tension gimmicks\\n\\nThe script heads for a constant thrill, and because of the slow pacing causes every major event to last more than it needs, and constantly stops with a cliffhanger. Although this can be a nice motivation for the audience to anticipate the next episode, they do it so many times and for events that could practically fit in only one episode. Tension loses its meaning if it happens all the time without proper relaxation points and after awhile you no longer find it exciting or edgy, exactly because it is always like that. You get used to it, it doesn’t look awesome anymore, and because most of whatever happens in it is about caricatures of people you forget as soon as they are dead, it becomes boring.\\n\\n9. Plot Driven\\n\\nAlthough this is not an issue with everyone, it is still a problem. The characters have no control over the events of the show; they are just reacting to them. No matter what happens, they will never choose what to do next; the plot is going to force them into what to do next. It makes sense for that to happen in stories that have to do with death and survival, but it also makes them pass as drones, unable to progress or develop further on their own, despite their hax superpowers. This takes away their significance, which is already very thin since you forget them 5 seconds after they die. This feeling only gets worse in later seasons when you find out amnesia and mind control are in this story as common as spring allergies. What kind of a mature story would turn its characters into sock puppets?\\n\\n10. It looks nice but that is all\\n\\nAs far as the artwork goes, there are big aesthetic differences between the manga and the anime adaptation. The manga feels very crude when it comes to proportions and perspective. It has very rough outlines and feels sketchy at points, with crude anatomy and stiff motions. The anime fixes these issues and even includes a catchy chorus OST to make it even more intriguing. There are still major quality drops throughout the show, since at some parts you get fluent animation and detailed artwork which make it look amazing, while in others you get static images and crude character figures which makes it look lame.\\n\\n11. It is still a fun show to watch just for the excitement, instead of yet another moe school life thingy\\n\\nI do agree though that as a whole AOT manages to build up tension right away. Even if you are aware of its problems, it is still not holding back in violence; the average Narutard is definitely going to like it. It is not a high school club ecchi comedy if you are not into that. As for me? After truly good manga such as Battle Angel Alita and Battle Royale, this was unintentional satire. No veteran reader or viewer is going to give it anything more than a good time waster status, because down to it, it is a silly shonen when it could easily be much better as a mature seinen.\\n\\n12. It didn’t even succeed in maintaining its status as a great anime\\n\\nAs for the hype this show has gotten? A few years down the line, the second season came out and by then there weren’t many interested in it anymore. It didn’t win at a single category during the Crunchyroll awards of 2017, and it got completely overshadowed by My Hero Academia, which was a generic fighting shonen. How is it possible for such a praised masterpiece of depth and thrills to get owned by the very generic shonen everyone was saying it easily tops? It’s because hype is hollow and eventually meaningless. There is always an anime every year that blows everyone’s brains out, only to be completely forgotten by the next year’s mind-blowing series. AOT is no exception to this. Later on the third and final season (which is like 10 parts lol) got more hype, but it was only for the animation. The manga ended terribly and now most people don’t think it’s that good as a whole. It was just a mindless action flick all along.',\n",
       " \"Before I actually write this review I ought to confess that I'm a humongous fan of the series and might be slightly biased.... Story: In the very first episode you get a false sense of being eased into this world nice and slow - getting informed of the characters' situation and a quick introduction, but before you know it a plot twist slaps you across the face so hard you can feel through the season both directly and indirectly. And about the plot - its somewhat simple yet eternally fascinating and intricate - ever evolving, you never know everything and it's certainly unpredictable to a frustratingextend, you never feel safe for the characters.\\nIt's not a cosy story, even though there are somewhat tender moments, this is a violent shounen and one of the very best, action packed and in your face. The plot is amazing.\\n\\nArt:\\nThe art is fantastic. The way the characters fly through the air and slice through their enemies is animated beautifully despite the gory nature of it. Of course these are the scenes that have been prioritised there are the ones that are less important visually where background characters etc, might look slightly funny, but it isn't really important or noticible. The scenes that you take not of and truly remember are remembered for their gorgeous animation.\\n\\nSound:\\nThe soundtrack is amazing and fits the series so darn well. \\nThe German bit of the opening is so appropriate considering there is a rather large chance that the characters might be in Europe (where Germany takes up quite a large chunk, so who knows ?) and it gets you so pumped for the plentiful action scenes. It really sets the mood very well throughout the series, so well that it feels completely natural to hear the orchestra blasting along the soldiers flying through the thick woods.\\nThe japanese voice actors are quite suitable for the characters too, I've enjoyed the soundtrack a lot and listened to it more often than I'd like to admit. \\n\\nCharacter:\\nAll the characters are so different and diverse, from Marco to Erwin, Levi to Hanji and Eren to Bert etc. It is so wonderful to get to know all of them, slowly fall in love with them and watch their loved ones die around them and fear for their lives too. Each character is completely unique and the characters are one of the best strong points of the series.\\nTo begin with I wasn't sure how I felt about them all, but after about one or two episodes with them each I fell head over heels. The character gallery is wide too, including lots of varied and strong women, though unfortunaly there is a lack of POC, an uncomfortable trend in anime. However some people view some of the characters somewhat stereotypical, I think that's only a first impression sorta thing, dig a little deeper and you'll find them all to be truly unique. Their enteractions are also precious.\\n\\nEnoyment:\\nI've rewatched the series four times in the last three months and I plan to continue rewatching it again and again untill the new season comes out in 27 years. I enjoyed every bit of it.\\n\\nOverall:\\nI enjoyed every bit of it. Love it.\\nAll the different components play well together and makes for an excellent show, very recommendable !\",\n",
       " '\"Shingeki no Kyojin\" or \"Attack on Titan\" (AOT) has received praise from both critics and audiences alike. With this in mind, I decided to watch it and was seriously disappointed. Although AOT has incredible artwork and highly developed characters, it fails to deliver a good story. The plot itself is actually interesting and has a lot of potential to be really good, but the anime drags on and on, taking several episodes simply to cover one battle or one plot point. Furthermore, each plot pointdoesn\\'t add much to the story itself, by which I mean it only adds more questions and gives no answers. A story needs to give answers to the questions it asks or that it invokes, otherwise it leaves the audience (or at least it left me) feeling let down. \\n                      Also, despite the fact that the characters are highly developed, I personally found it hard to care that much about them since most of them end up dying rather quickly, making all that development pretty much pointless. This also made me feel rather uninspired whenever a character gave some inspirational speech or rallying cry because even when they do that, they end up getting slaughtered.\\n                      Lastly, the excessive amount of emotional scenes took away a lot of their intended effect. I found myself thinking \"yes, yes, we get it, can we move on now?\" whenever these drawn out emotional scenes appeared simply because there were too many of them and they really desensitized me to the very real emotions that were present.\\nWith those things in mind, I will admit that the artwork of AOT is incredible, using a unique style and taking full advantage of certain elements present within AOT\\'s unique world to create some very powerful scenes. Also, although the characters feel a little disposable to me, The characters are still very well developed and relatable. \\nSo it ultimately comes down to what your looking for in an anime. If your looking for a good, full story, i would recommend you pass. But if your more into artwork and character, then you definitely need to watch it.',\n",
       " 'Attack on titan is a normal action shonen. This show is a reflection on how the standards of violence these days have gone up.So much Death and Gore scenes fill the screen. Shows like Naruto and One piece have considerably less. That is where the popularity of this show lies,the animation for the titans,the \\'viral misleading\" op.and the death and gore. Characters are rather simple.No development.Eren our preaching screaming hero.Mikasa our Mary sue who loves Eren and Armin where pointing out the obvious makes him smart.Everybody else exists to just die to add to the death scenes.\\n\\nThe training arc was a disappointment,instead of showing me how they will approach the titans in practice(that scene where they did only occurred in theory),shows me a faulty gear arc.\\n\\nThat first  op is very very, misleading,most of the Titan killers wouldn\\'t even dare\\nto approach them,Some would even stand still and monologue for no reason, Some would even SHOOT themselves out of fear.\\n\\nExcept for the one and only from the training arc, Mikasa, who lives only for Eren, can kill Titans\\nThis show is no special symbol for Female empowerment. \\n\\nIn others words these people don\\'t value their own lives and training,their deaths are meaningless.\\n\\nOur main character becomes a Titan to save the day.Armin was always smart,so his first tactic did  not show anything new to him,overshadowed even.Humanity vs titans?\\n\\nDon\\'t get me started on the Salute to save Eren,that certainly was \"forced in\". There was no thinking process involved and no link to their bald boss  dude shown before.\\n\\nThen Titanman goes into moral contemplation mode,needlessly for one episode and plugs the hole.\\n\\nLearning that the titans are inactive at night was drilled into me due to their dragged out episodes.\\n\\nAnd yet for their next expedition they travel in the DAY to find a female titan and not even go to the obviously advantageous basement as originally planned ...\\n\\nSome would say would it be difficult to see at night.But who in their right mind would rather face an ENTIRE ARMY OF GIANTS.Even if the shows pulls the exceptions out of the blue, it would be rare and they would have strength in numbers.\\n\\nAt least somebody other than Mikasa could kill the titans,Levi and some in the elite squad. \\n\\nOf course they lost to Evil Titanwoman.\\n\\nComing back to the city only to beat her in the end.With some new burning power by the main lead.Took them long enough to figure out it was Annie,thanks to Captain Obvious Armin. \\n\\nThis show has way more questions that answers which is a bad thing.The the story destroy itself over time?\\n\\nThis is just cool to look at and just for the action.This is neither a masterpiece nor a savior,its typical.All this show did is swap the romantic comedy genre tag for the Action.\\n\\nThe writing is on the same boat.OK to watch just for fun.But going too deep into it is a bad idea.',\n",
       " 'Shingeki no Kyojin or as it is more commonly known as Attack on Titan is undoubtedly the most hyped anime of the spring season and arguably of the entire year The hype for the show had already existed before the show even aired it first episode and it only shot up from there. This begs the question is Attack on Titan really the show that people notably fans of the show make it out to be? The show opens up as humanity is being driven to the brink by man-devouring giants known as the Titans. Mankind has survived by caging themselves within a walled city inorder to distance themselves off from the Titans. When the Titans eventually do break into the city, our protagonist Eren Yeager vows to avenge his mother who had fallen prey to the mankind’s predators until every last one of them is dead.\\n\\nI came into show not knowing what to expect from the show. I have heard of the manga but I didn’t really think of anything of it at the time. I was initially unaware of the hype surrounding the show so I basically went into a show with a clean slate. \\nJudging by the first episode alone, the show looks to be a promising series. The introductory episode is pretty good and does an adequate introducing you to its world and characters. The animation was gorgeous especially during key moments in the episode. The music was a good with special mention going to the show’s first opening theme, “Crimson Bow and Arrow,” by Linked Horizon that really does get you pump up to watch the show. The Titans are especially intimating with their grotesque designs but I would care for more explanation that hopefully latter episodes elaborate upon.\\n\\nThe show continued to impress with it aesthetics. The show always brimming with energy from its fantastic score to its very fluid animation. The score is helmed by none other than Hiroyuki Sawano who has his hand on other popular anime such as Guilty Crown, Blue Exorcist, Gundam Unicorn and among many others. He is one my favorite musicians to come out of anime and he works never fails to impress. His score makes the show a pleasure to listen especially during the various high-points throughout the show. \\n\\nThe animation is handled by both the up and coming Wit Studio and the more well-known Production I.G. They animation is fairly consistent which always a plus. What makes animation in this series really stand out is the use omni-dimensional maneuver gear which is particularly interesting and make for some very dynamic fight sequences. The animation team really put their best foot forward doing sequences involving the usage of them.\\n\\nI can’t really vouch for any of the voice work mostly because I am not particularly well-versed in the Japanese language but to my eyes the voice actors all the good with the material they were given. I have to give special mention to Yuki Kaji who voices our protagonist Eren. He never fails to make him sound especially creepy during those certain moments later on in the show.\\nHowever a show cannot stand own through these merits alone. If you begin to look past show’s more shallow aspects then you start to see that this show may not as good as it is made out to be.\\nThe show had already grabbed me by it interesting but not entirely original premise. The world is under the heels of natural predator makes for a great atmosphere and is one of the finer examples of a dark fantasy in recent memory. Needless to say the Titans, the series’ antagonist, behave very similarity to zombies. Thus making the show feels as if you’re watching yet another spin of the zombie apocalypse which everyone has probably seen before. This is probably why the show has much mainstream appeal as the zombie apocalypse genre is quite popular here in the west. This aspect makes this show great for the casual view I guess.\\n\\nThere is one area which the show really lacks and is its characters. While the show’s many characters are quite colorful, they are pretty flat and don’t really step out the boundaries of being mere archetypes. \\n\\nEren is yet another clichéd shonen protagonist who is defined by little more than his conviction to exterminate the Titans. While his convictions are understandable considering what he has been through but that is all he is. Despite all of his talk, he mostly all bark and no bite. Of course he get is obligatory shonen power-up and everyone turn to him to do anything noteworthy. However, he is hardly the ideal shounen protagonist. There really is special about him save for the fact that he is dangerously determined. His aforementioned shonen power-up doesn’t win every battle and quite frankly does more harm than good. Above all though, Eren is just plain scary so much so that it actually becomes a plot point. \\nLastly, He is really same person he was as the beginning of the story to the end. He character doesn’t really get much in the way of character development. \\n\\nThe a few other notable character notably Mikasa who would be a strong female character if there was more than her character than her obsession with Eren. I know Eren helped at a key moment in her life but that all she cares about really. She really isn’t shown caring about anything else. It is almost a bit creepy. It got to the point that various characters in the show have taken note of this. Of course she is hold her own quite well but I really wishes she was wasn’t over reliant on Eren.\\n\\nThen with have Armin who acts as sort the brain of the group. While Eren relies on sheer willpower and determination, Mikasa relies on her practical skills, Armin relies on his smarts. Despite this he really does contribute much to plot and is really just sort of there. At time when he does get to use his smarts, it really only there to point out things that are rather obvious and anyone with a brain could probably figure out.\\n\\nThere are other notable characters include as Jean who unlike our protagonist actually develops over the course of the story and Captain Levi who is a genuine badass but even they are truly notable. \\n\\nThe rest of the cast can pretty much be summed in a little more than few words. They are very one note and thus aren’t too terribly compelling. Most of them quite forgettable besides for less than a handful of the cast\\n\\nOften character dies dramatically mostly redshirts you are supposed care but since we know so little about them are we as the audience are meet with is indifference. This show runs on a shock value to reel in viewers week by week which by itself starts to irritate you after a while making it less and less shocking each time it happens. It starts to become a regular occurrence.\\nThe show’s pacing is notable for being absolutely horrendous. The episodes are often accompanied but rather lengthy recaps of the episodes before often being three or more minutes long. There are several scenes which notable padding where things are taking much longer than they should. There are several episodes where little to hardly anything happens until the very end of course. It is not as bad as some other shonen but still quite notable. That brings to me to yet another point.\\n\\nThe show is a shonen through and through despite the show’s overall dark and brooding atmosphere. The show attempts to tell a mature story with the inclusion of more mature and concepts that one can rarely in shows of its genre. The show is rather violent and grotesque for a supposed children’s show. The fights especially between the titans are quite brutal.  However the show simply comes across as pretentious as tries to be more than what it is. The show frequently plays up some the more tired shonen trope and clichés. In the end this only serves to hinder the show overall.\\n\\nOn the surface, the show looks pretty it really is but when actually start to look inward you’ll find the show is quite ugly. Attack on Titan is by no means a bad show. It is certainly an entertaining show. It was fun ride to watch it week by week. It certainly fares much better than most of the anime to come out the spring season. That and unlike many popular shows of its kind its hype is not entirely unwarranted. There some good to be had here. \\nHowever despite all of this is not a particularly smart show. It has all the making to be a great show but what it fails at is certainly its execution. This is a reason why this show has garnered so much hype as most viewers aren’t willing to take time to dissect it and only appreciate show at face value. Regardless, I will say this I would recommend this show but it is neither the best show of the year or what people make out it be. If you need a new show to check it out then this is certainly up your alley. \\nIt is a good show that wants great show but make a more than few stumbles on the way. It was fun ride though and I will be there when the inevitable second season heads our way.\\n\\nPros:\\n\\n+Dark and inventive world\\n+Setting is certainly intriguing\\n+Likeable and varied cast.\\n+The music is fantastic and well-orchestrated. Does well to set up the mood of the show and highlight the various high points in the show.\\n+The animation is high-quailty throughout and especially scenes involving the omni-dimensional maneuver gear are very well-done.\\n\\nCons:\\n\\n-There are some scenes where the animation is less than stellar though it isn’t enough to ruin the whole experience.\\n-Horrid pacing which cause the show to drag numerous times during the show.\\n-Relies heavily on shock value.\\n-Most of the character is rather flat and one-note. Thus making it hard for viewers to care little or nothing at all about what happens to them.\\n-Despite everything it does, it still a clichéd shounen which holds it back from it true potential.',\n",
       " 'This is by far the most overhyped anime I have ever seen. Before you fanboys attack me, overhyped anime does not mean it\\'s a bad anime. It means fans exaggerated the status and quality of the anime by saying \"Greatest Anime Ever\" which is not. I admit, I love the show but it\\'s not the greatest anime in existence. (There will be some SPOILERS in my review) Story: (8/10) (SPOILERS) The story focuses on Eren and Mikasa as they witnessed a colossal Titan appear out of nowhere and started attacking the walls. The walls that have kept them safe for over a hundred years have now beenbreached and smaller Titans have flooded the city and started attacking the humans. \\nNow here\\'s the reasons why I love the show. My first reason and very top reason is the fact that this is set in the post-apocalyptic world, where humans (mostly the Scout Regiment) are fighting the Titans and trying to bring their world back. Secondly, it\\'s not just a simple \"Humans are defending against the Titans\" concept. Who knew there would also be humans who can also transfer into a Titan. That Human Titan can either help the human race or obliterate the human race. It makes the show even more exciting to watch. My third and final reason is the fact that the show is not afraid to kill off characters. I mean it had a few cliches were someone will save that character from being eaten but for the most part, you know that they\\'re going to die and they\\'re not coming back. \\nNow, the story pacing. Some might disagree with me on this but to me, it\\'s messed up. The first 5 episodes, it was jumping around in years then later on, the pacing was normal, then the pacing went incredibly slow. By the way, I don\\'t mind the time skips at the first 5 episodes because I understand that they were showing us (the viewers) how Eren is going to become a part of the military. Anyways, here\\'s my problem with the story pacing. The 1st half seemed like a normal pacing to me. The 2nd half, however had the worst story pacing I\\'ve ever seen. It\\'s too slow and it dragged on forever. The objective was to go to Eren\\'s basement but it somehow turned into a Female Titan interrupting that plan for no apparent reason and this is where it dragged on until the ending. Why did she do that? I have no idea and this is where I\\'ll switch subjects and talk about the plot holes. \\nThe show has a lot of plot holes and I\\'ll give out a few of those plot holes. Where exactly did the Titans come from? How were they born? How did Eren\\'s dad developed that \"Titan\" syringe and why did he give it to him?  How and why did Annie had the capability to transform into a Titan? If my theory is right, is the Colossal and Armoured Titans humans too? And so much more that I can\\'t list them here. They better fill them plot holes at the 2nd season. Let\\'s get back to the slow pacing shall we? I don\\'t mind slow story pacing but if the show is not going to reward you with the knowledge that you gathered then you might as well not make the pacing slow. What are my thoughts about the ending? It was rushed, it ended in a cliffhanger and I was a bit disappointed. How about the plot twists? Yea, the show failed on this one. It was very predictable. One example is when Eren \"died\". I already knew that he didn\\'t die because what show would kill off its main character very early in the series right?. Another example is when a mysterious Titan saves Mikasa and fights another Titan. I already knew it was Eren because of the hair and it\\'s the only logical choice I have. Want another example? How about the Female Titan? I knew it was a human because she showed intelligence but who? I thought it was either Mikasa or Annie. I saw Mikaka fighting one of the Titans and my only choice would be Annie. When they revealed her true identity. I was like \"Wow, what a surprise\" with a sarcastic voice. \\n\\n\\n\\nArt/Animation: (9/10)\\nThe animation is very well done. The way they animated the action scenes, it  was great. It\\'s very fluid. Especially when they use the ODM gears. Better than Spiderman. The character designs were also well done with some few minor flaws. How about the Titans design? My god, whoever designed the Titans, give this man/woman a medal. The first time I saw them, they were batshit creepy. \\n\\n\\n\\nSound: (10/10)\\nNo doubt, a perfect score from me. Why? The music used in the fighting scenes are so well done. Both the openings are very well done. The 1st OP is awesome and the 2nd OP is great. I still prefer the 1st OP though. The 2nd OP did depressed me quite a bit. You\\'ll know later on in the review.  The voice actors. I watched the show in English Dub so I have no idea how these characters sounds like in Japanese. One word. Masterpiece. Eren\\'s VA which is Bryce (who also voiced Kirito from SAO) is so good. The way he screamed in agonizing pain, the way he shouts out of anger, perfect. I don\\'t know who voiced Mikasa but great job to whoever voiced her. It perfectly fitted her character.\\n\\n\\nCharacter: (7/10) (SPOILERS)\\nThis is where the show kind of failed. As much as I loved the characters, there was a lack of character development. Eren stayed the same and Mikasa stayed the same. You know what, pretty much most of the characters stayed the same. Some of the characters were bland (not all) and some of characters are clichèd. Some fanboys might think that I hated the characters because I rated the character section 7 but I don\\'t. I DON\\'T hate the characters because they were interesting to me. Like I said above, the show is not afraid to kill off it\\'s characters. Most of the time, I would be shocked (only for the first 10 episodes) because one of the characters that had the potential to become my favorite character gets killed off. There is at one point where a set of characters from Levi\\'s Elite Scout Regiment (Eld, Gunther, Levi, Olou, and Petra)got killed off by the Female Titan (Levi wasn\\'t killed). Now, this is the point where I got depressed and felt sad for the whole day because they were the best group I have ever seen. I don\\'t care if the Titans kills some of the characters because they\\'re a bunch of cowards but these guys......why?\\n\\n\\n\\nEnjoyment: (10/10)\\nAfter watching the first 8 episodes of the series, I already know I\\'m going to rate my Enjoyment a perfect score of 10. I was always on the edge of my seat every single episode and I never felt bored(except the ending). Everytime I see the \"To be continued\" screen, I\\'m like \"Noooo!!!\".\\n\\n\\n\\nOverall: (8.8/10) ----Rounding it to--(9/10)\\nLike I said above, this is the most overhyped anime I\\'ve ever seen. People were telling me \"This is the best anime ever\" or \"Best anime in existence\". I can\\'t believe I believed these people. Sure, I love the show but there is no way in hell this is the \"Best Anime in Existence\". I still recommend that you watch this show because it\\'s jam packed with action and some emotional scenes but please, don\\'t believe the hype like I did. Now my thoughts about this anime. The 1st half is perfect but the 2nd half.....I was a bit dissapointed because it dragged out for way too long and they never really achieved their goal.\\n\\n\\n\\nPros:\\n-Great Story\\n-Great Animation\\n-Perfect Soundtrack\\n-Emotional scenes can sometimes hit you\\n-You\\'re always on the edge of your seat \\n\\n\\nCons:\\n-Little to no character development\\n-Bland and cliched characters (not all)\\n-2nd half\\'s pacing is way too slow\\n-A lot of plot holes',\n",
       " 'Well, I bought into the hype. This show lives up to it. Story: The world in this anime is amazing. A weird Middle Ages-type world, weird humanoid things running around eating people, weird cord-type devices used to move around like Spiderman? It\\'s immersive from the start. The explicit material is insane and puts you on the edge of your seat--I gasped plenty times throughout the show, just for how brutal and insane the gore was. Also, this anime deals with an extremely mature storyline that seems to come out of left field (**SPOILER:** Mikasa\\'s backstory), which I thought was a nice touch. Every episode of thisshow is completely interesting--perfect for a binge watch, though it moves kind of slowly towards the end. The underlying themes of corruption brought into this show at the end, which will (probably) be expanded on next season, made the show just that more interesting to me. Only one bad note--the military formation stuff got really confusing to me, but without going back to try to understand much of it I could still decipher what was going on.\\n\\nCharacters: The characters in this show are mostly one-note and can be identified by one or two characteristics that they stick to in each episode: Eren is determined, Mikasa likes to save Eren a lot, says \"EREN!\" all the time, and is badass, Sasha likes food and is nervous, etc. I don\\'t think this anime really *needs* a ton of character development, THERE ARE GIANT SKINNED HUMANOIDS EATING PEOPLE EVERYWHERE. This is a story-driven anime, though I will admit if there were complex characters it would push a wonderful anime into \"best anime I\\'ve ever seen\" territory.\\n\\nOverall: Immersive story, gore and twists that will make you gasp and/or scream expletives at the top of your lungs, but one-note characters and some slow episodes.\\nOverall 9',\n",
       " 'I must say I was disappointed with this one. After all the hype I expected something good. The show resembles Claymore in many, many ways which is the main reason I watched it but while Claymore scores lower, I still believe it to be superior in every way. As far as the story goes, it\\'s very basic. Giant people and that\\'s about it. The character\\'s are the worst part of the whole anime bearing little to no personality and being annoying and/or useless almost all the time. They have this overly dramatic monologues and are constantly stalling the pacing with their \"going insane\" or \"I amso shocked\" dramas. While you expect them to react like this, it wears off very quickly and becomes irritating.\\nWhere it succeeds is the action. Great art and good fight scenes but even these suffer from the ever so often staling of the character\\'s reactions.\\nOverall, I truly believe this to be over hyped and overrated but if you are willing to sit through it for the fights scenes then more power to you.',\n",
       " \"When I first saw the movie, I didn't see what the big deal was. All right, so a girl gets whisked away to a fantasy world? We've heard that story before. And, unlike many other movies, there's no dramatic love story or epic battles and action scenes to keep you at the edge of your seat. Consequently, I didn't think of it as being very exciting. Still, I watched it again and, for some reason, I got it the second time around. Spirited Away isn't meant to be anything grand, with all the bells and whistles. It has a quiet, subdued way of telling a simplestory about a simple girl in a very strange world. Instead of expecting something huge, just sit back, watch, and appreciate the world and story Miyazaki has finely crafted for us all to enjoy.\\n\\nTo get to the technical aspects...\\n\\nThe art is, of course, amazing. The colours are rich and the animation is fluid. When Chihiro and her family first walk into the spirit world, you can practically feel the breeze as you watch it whisk through the grass. The lights of the spirit world at night are breathtaking. And watching the train ride closer to the end of the movie, coupled with the amazing music score (the track is called &amp;quot;The Sixth Station&amp;quot;), remains one of my most favourite animation sequences out of anything I've seen. Which brings me to another point: the music.\\n\\nI will get this out of the way first - Joe Hisaishi is one of my favourite composers. His music style is very simple, but he makes every note count. Most of his music is quite subdued in nature and takes a careful ear to notice when your eyes are being captivated by what's going on in the screen, but do take notice if you have the chance. Or search on YouTube for videos of his live performances. His music is a joy to listen to. Like with Spirited Away, Hisaishi's music lacks all the &amp;quot;bells and whistles&amp;quot; per se, but it's beauty lies in its simplicity. Hisaishi has not failed here in Spirited Away.\\n\\nI dearly loved the characters. One of the best parts of this movie, for me, was that it lacked any clear good or evil characters. Everyone has a bit of both, though perhaps some allow the evil sides of them to come out a bit more obviously than others. In this way, it's very realistic. Granted, the characters were all quite predictable and Chihiro grated on my nerves at times, but overall, I enjoyed each and every one of the characters Miyazaki has create here.\\n\\nOverall, Spirited Away is one of my favourite movies and will always be a treasured item in my small DVD collection. It requires some patience to get through since it's not packed with action or drama, but it's a nice fairy tale to watch and enjoy.\",\n",
       " 'This is my first review in MyAnimeList, so I apologize in advance if you find the ideas I\\'ll put forward here badly-written, explained or structured. I am going to talk about Spirited Away (yeah, obvious). It\\'s been quite a long time since I watched it for the last time, more than a year in fact; but I became a really fascinating and influential piece for me at that time, far enough to define my current love for Miyazaki\\'s works, the Studio Ghibli and animation in general as an art and a strong way of expression. Today it\\'s still one of my favorite animated features of anysort, and not because of its lack of flaws than its amazing blend of concepts.\\n\\nThe first thing that appeals the audience in this movie is its art and animation. I, as unexperienced and poor in technical knowledge about the subject, think it\\'s utter fascinating, it manages to create a whole world out of nothing, and the use of lights and shades, the forms and colours make the overall experience a visual joy. And in addition to that I find the characters\\' gestures and movements extremely plastic and realistic, some other scenes have been mentioned in that aspect by other reviewers but I was particularly fond of that one where Chihiro is walking with her parents and she gradually moves away, only to come back to her position with a little run-up. These things don\\'t happen, usually, in animation. In so far as they are unnecessary, easily ignorable and feel like a waste of resources, we hardly see characters making these little movements which in the end result in nothing relevant. Ghibli, however, animates them, and does it with such a mastery, a love for detail and a goddamn naturalism that I can\\'t help but feel amazed.\\n\\nAs if the visual aspect wasn\\'t good enough, the movie is also a pleasure for our ears and has what I consider the best track of my heavily worshipped Joe Hisaishi, one of the best (if not the best) film composers I have ever heard. Spirited Away is exceptionally good at that aspect; I\\'d say it\\'s one of the very few cases in which there is, at some scenes, such a strong fusion between story and music, that I can\\'t conceive nor think of one without the other.\\n\\nBut despite all of these beautiful qualities about its setting, the real substance of this movie is at its story. I apologize in advance, again, because as I\\'m going to develop some points I will give some free spoilers. If you haven\\'t seen the movie I\\'d recommend to stop reading at this point.\\n\\nIt has been said many times by critics that Spirited Away felt like a senseless blend of magic elements, just a simple story filled with many things the author introduced undiscriminatingly to drag out the experience. Well, I have a quite different point of view for that device. I just can\\'t conceive that the animation, for example, is taken to such a high level of detail and, on the other hand, that doesn\\'t happen with the story. And by rewatching it repeatedly in a short amount of time (once every two months, more or less), I began to develop some theories about the nature of the world that is depicted here.\\n\\nWhat must be considered at first is that all this magical world, with strange creatures and spells, is just an allegory for the always difficult transiton between childhood and the first steps of adulthood. It\\'s the age you start dealing with responsibility, when you realize your acts have consequences and you have to make decisions that will affect your future; you define yourself and the course of your life. Miyazaki puts these simple concepts by transforming the need of finding an identity into a way to escape the wonderful yet cruel world where Chihiro is suddenly trapped. Its hostility imitates quite well the drama of the process, as it reinforces the need of an additional effort every one of us have to make at some point and reset our lives and our positions.\\n\\nDoes this mean that Yubaba\\'s world is an undeveloped blend of magic, hostile things that only serve as a situation that Chihiro has to overcome at some point? Well, I don\\'t think so, as it seems to have a clear structure and hierarchy. One of the stories I see compared more often with this one is Alice in Wonderland. However, I would define that as a blend of unrelated events, a story whose main charm lies in its anarchic, nearly nightmarish, narrative. Spirited Away is not like that in any way. In fact I think there is an effort to transmit a strong sense of logic throughout, it tries to delimit the causes and consequences of every single case.\\n\\nThe key character to understand how Yubaba\\'s tyranny works is, in my opinion, Lin. She just happens to be the link between Chihiro and the rest of the magical creatures, just like somebody that is in some sort of intermediate level. Her physical appearance looks slightly transformed, but not as much as the rest. She is aware of the existence of another world outside of that one, the importance of remembering her name, her \"identity\"; and knowing that, she helps Chihiro and takes the role of a mother. I have the theory that every one of the creatures that live in Yubaba\\'s world were once human, maybe little boys and girls like Chihiro who couldn\\'t find the way to escape, or other people; and they ended up forgetting who they were, losing their \"humanity\" and becoming mere pieces of this world. Lin is a special case because it seems she\\'s not lost her identity yet, at least not at all, but forgot at one point her name, the key to come back home, and knows her situation is irreversible. She maybe observed this in some of her companions when she arrived, and Chihiro reminds herself of that. Maybe because of that, because she knows and appreciates what she\\'s doomed to lose, she decides to help her in an altruistic way.\\n\\nAnd what about Kamaji? Another key character in Chihiro\\'s development in there; he seems to be quite aware of his situation too. I\\'d say he is a bit like the \"sacrificed\" individual, who Yubaba used to start his project and maybe the only one that didn\\'t lose his identity at all. He\\'s a slave in this world, he knows it but can\\'t help it.\\n\\nSo yes, I have a more \"adult\" and crude view of the overall concept. This definition of the magical public baths as a place were people are doomed to end up losing what makes them \"special\" is quite harsh and melancholic for a -as targeted and admitted by Miyazaki- kid\\'s movie, and it might feel even weird, but that\\'s how I interpreted it and I think it makes some sense.\\n\\nDoes this mean Yubaba is a villain? Well, define villain. Somebody whose only objective in life is to harm people? That\\'s hardly what Yubaba is. She, for better or for worse, created a world, and made it work. She imposed some rules. We could even say she created her own utopia (and that doesn\\'t mean she is naturally \"bad\"), why not? And, most important, she has a strong sense of honor, she dictates and also OBEYS her rules. One of the (maybe) main reasons why she loses her battle against Chihiro, in fact, is that her weakness is shown eventually (giant baby); and reveals a hypocritical attitude, as she is protecting her lovely child from any influence while she\\'s always preaching the exact contrary. As she knows it, it\\'s a shameful thing to admit and maybe here is where her image of forcefulness starts to teeter.\\n\\nAll in all, these examples just show that the real strength of this story lies in the characters, as they are always depicted in a detailed way. Yubaba not being the typical villain, or not even being a \"villain\" at all; Haku, the hero and the \"positive\" one here has also an overambitious side and is for the most part guilty of his situation... and Chihiro, of course. She is a spoiled brat who learns to appreciate some things, but in no way overreacting at these points, as she sounds real and relatable at every damn scene. It\\'s quite easy to understand her, she\\'s not made to be likeable but her portrayal is solid enough to make us join her development through the story.\\n\\nI could spend hours and hours talking about this precious anime and its many details, the enigmatic role of No Face, the negative influence of the parents in Chihiro\\'s behaviour, and so much more... I love it. It breathes mastery at (almost) every one of its points, and I can enjoy it in many levels. My only grip would be the way things are resolved, which I have always found too rushed; reading Miyazaki\\'s opinion on that ending I\\'ve come to understand the intention behind, but still I\\'d say the metaphor is made too subtle for the audience, and maybe the execution is also somewhat clumsy. But aside from this minor flaw, I can\\'t help but admire this fascinating, eye-captivating piece of art, my second favorite anime behind Grave Of The Fireflies.',\n",
       " 'In many ways this is a difficult review to write. This is because I&rsquo;m clearly not the target audience, as Spirited Away is a film that is clearly targeted towards children. In the end, I simply decided to review the film as I normally do and leave a disclaimer about not being the target audience. I first watched this film 5 years ago during my senior year in high school when a friend of mine was raving about it. Back then I found the film to be boring and feature a paper thin plot. Now 5 years later and a few hundredanime titles later I was compelled to review this.  However, since it was 5 years since I viewed the film, I decided to re-watch Spirited Away in preparation for this review as my memory is a bit foggy.  After watching it again, I discovered 2 things about Spirited Away.  I now know why I forgotten many of the events, thus needed to re-watch it and my perspective about the film really hasn&amp;rsquo;t changed. \\n\\nSpirited Away begins with Chihiro&amp;rsquo;s family moving to their new home.  Like any normal 10 years old girl she is quite sadden and angry about leaving her old life (hell anyone would feel this way).  Chihiro&amp;rsquo;s father makes a wrong turn somewhere and decides to take a short cut through the forest.  Ok, perfectly normal but what gets me is when they see an abandon building they decided to go in and explore.  Next, they go, &amp;ldquo;oh look food that&amp;rsquo;s sitting out with no-one around&amp;rdquo; let eat.  The events leading up to Chihiro getting trapped in the fantasy world are way too plot devicy for my taste.  However, this isn&amp;rsquo;t my main complaint about the film, it&amp;rsquo;s just that the rest is so shallow I can&amp;rsquo;t really analyze it with much depth.  The rest of the story can be summarized by Chihiro get a jobs, does a job, returns something, get freed and goes home.  In fact, I&amp;rsquo;m quite dumfounded as to how they created a 2 hour movie with this plot line.\\n\\nAlthough, perhaps I&amp;rsquo;m being too critical with the story and story structure that Spirited Away takes.  What I think Spirited Away tries to do is create a magical world in which the viewer can escape to.  It tries to take us on an adventure to somewhere very different.  That is does, studio Ghibli creates a worlds that is both imaginative and beautiful.  I could go on and on about the world but words wouldn&amp;rsquo;t do it justice.  However, something is very wrong when the only major praise I can give is about the fantasy world that is created.  They spend way too much time creating and focusing on this world.  When I analyze a few scenes I realize how drawn out Spirited Away makes each scene.  They could have easily cut 30-40 minutes and have a more focused story.  This is how they were able to stretch such a thin plot out for 2 hours.\\n\\nWhen reviewing anime I put the most weight on the plot and characters.  I&amp;rsquo;ve already talked about how thin and weak the plot is in the above paragraphs.  Sadly the characters don&amp;rsquo;t fare too much better.  Chihiro does grow over the course of the movie and in the end she is a bit stronger and can now face new challenges (i.e. new school, neighborhood, etc).  After going through what she went through, I don&amp;rsquo;t think a new school will faze her.  However, there really isn&amp;rsquo;t much to Chihiro&amp;rsquo;s character, she&amp;rsquo;s simply a random girl that happens to go on an inadvertent adventure and becomes a little bit stronger in the end.  She feels a bit like an empty shell for the audience to live through.  In general, the characterization for the movie feels a bit weak, I mean do we really know these characters?  If that&amp;rsquo;s all there is to these characters, then I have no choice but to conclude that most of them are extremely flat.  \\n\\nOk now on to the easy part of this review, the technical aspects.  It should be no surprise that the animation and art is top notch.  This is studio Ghibli and Spirited Away is also a movie so there should be no excuses when it comes to animation.  The environments are beautiful and quite vibrant.  Characters designs are extremely consistent but I don&amp;rsquo;t like the designs that Studio Ghibli uses.  Not really a negative, just a personal preference.  Music, really works to create and accent the magical world of Spirited Away.   However, the music is nothing too note worthy, above average I guess.  In contrast, the voice work, this is a meh for me in both the English and Japanese, nothing really outstanding or bad.  However, there really wasn&amp;rsquo;t anything in the movie that would require the VAs to show their talent.  \\n\\nAs with any Miyazaki films there are themes of environmentalism along with others in particular, greed.  Thankfully, these themes and ideas never become the focus or become too blatant.  Also, I have to add another audience that Spirited Away may have been targeted to.  That would be nostalgic Japanese adults that long for a more traditional setting away from the modern world.  In that respects it does a great job however, I&amp;rsquo;m neither a child nor a Japanese adult disillusioned with the modern world.  So it should be no surprise that I&amp;rsquo;m not very fond of this film, as none of the positives really appeal to me.  Those would be the imaginative/magical or nostalgic world of Spirited Away.\\n\\nSpirited Away is an imaginative and magical world that child will most likely enjoy.  In addition, its nostalgic feel will appeal to some Japanese adults.  However, it also features a paper thin plot as well as weak characterization.  Spirited Away is a nice watch if you want to get away for 2 hours and turn off your brain but it is ultimately shallow and forgettable.  Even now after watching it a few hours ago I&amp;rsquo;m having a hard time remembering the details.',\n",
       " \"The very facet of childhood can be boiled down to the very definition of mysterious wonder and awe-inspiring imagination. We’ve all had those moments where we would go off into our little world of childlike imagination and try to experience an entirely new reality different from our own. Films have attempted to recapture the atmosphere that resembles this nostalgic feeling of going through the childhood journey that either succeeded or failed. It just takes a man like Miyazaki to do just that flawlessly. Miyazaki isn’t a stranger to making movies about childhood and things similar to its nature; Totoro would be an obvious example of thisfact. He certainly has an eye for making these kinds of stories that his movies could reflect everyday childhood experiences that we have since grown out of and are now living in a fantastical world. The fantasy elements that are a constant staple of the Miyazaki lore have made most of his movies unique to many people, including myself, because of their originality and inventive folklore. Now, that isn’t to say that I’m the biggest Miyazaki fan as much as the next person. However, if there is one film that could never lose its imaginative and beautiful vision in his filmography with each passing viewing, Spirited Away would win at no contest.\\n\\nIn describing what kind of story Spirited Away follows, coming-of-age would be the most logical way of putting it. In that, we follow our main protagonist Chihiro and how she handles certain situations that would prove to be difficult for any other young person such as herself. When she first encounters this Spirit World, she is lost, hopeless, and confused. Not knowing what will happen to her or her parents after being turned into pigs, she finally finds help from other characters willing to help her be acquainted with this world, unlike her own. Once she is acquainted with the Spirit world, we now see her as a strong individual once she is more aware of her surroundings and can take care of herself without the help of Haku. It is by the end of the film an essential point to what makes not only Chihiro a fantastic character but also how Spirited Away paces its story structure.\\n\\nArt and animation are nothing but superb in Studio Ghibli’s legacy in how they incorporate more emphasis on impressionist-inspired backgrounds with traditional hand-drawn animation. The scope of Miyazaki’s artistic vision is vast and organic in each of his films, and some other Ghibli films not directed by him sometimes lack minimal detail. Spirited Away may not have the most extensive scope in terms of scale, such as his previous films Nausicaä or even Princess Mononoke. I would argue the minimal scope works magnificently with the show’s structure. From the wonderfully drawn buildings to the tiniest detail of rust and wood splinters to the hypnotic waters surrounding the spirit world, it complements Miyazaki’s ascetic vision and Ghibli’s artistic talents exceptionally well.\\n\\nRegarding the art, the one aspect of it that Spirited Away shines on the most is its creative art designs of the characters of each spirit you come across. They look original and not thought of from the previous animation, despite most of them being inspired by Japanese folklore. It’s not as if most of them are forgettable the minute after you see them. They all stick with you as you go along with the film, how impressive and imaginative the art design is even years after you finish it.\\n\\nTo describe how the character Chihiro is treated, as in how she is portrayed in the film, it would be essential to realize how Miyazaki wrote her as to how a real child would act. You’ve probably seen kids that behave like Chihiro, or you may have been like here at her age, and that behavior would be considered “bratty” or “immature.” But these shouldn’t be seen as negatives since, realistically, kids are at her age, as you see Chihiro before she goes to the spirit world. We see Chihiro go through hardship when she arrives through the spirit world, and then we have this sense of hoping for her to succeed due to her bravery and strong courage to help her parents. It gives her a sense of humanity that could make you feel so much empathy for her as not only just some drawing in motion but as a human being in the flesh in some ways.\\n\\nOther characters such as Kamajii, Lin, Kaonishi, and Yubaba fill in the cast quite nicely. Kamajii and Lin fill in as likable slight comic relief characters giving Spirited Away an excellent needed level of charm from the voice acting and dialogue. Yubaba, at first, does seem like the main villain, but from how you see around it, there isn’t a villain in this movie. She’s nothing more than just a woman who wants to run her bathhouse in a very traditional way that has no ambition to do anything evil in nature. Kaonishi, the spirit that follows Chihiro in the bathhouse, gives the film a vulnerable side from his troubles of being alone, all through no dialogue at all, at least from his voice.\\n\\nNow we come to music. Composed by Joe Hisaishi, Miyazaki’s main collaborator in almost all of his films as a composer, it is pure excellence in Hisaishi’s backlog. This excellence shouldn’t be surprising, considering how he composes scores from listening to his songs, how they interact with what is going on, and how it leads the story from each scene to another. These aspects are accomplished by how Hisaishi makes the songs so vibrant. I guarantee that there is not one person in the world with a clear conscience who listens to “One Summer’s Day” and does not burst into tears.\\n\\nWith utmost sincerity, Spirited Away is Hayao Miyazaki’s magnum opus. Though many will claim this to be his most “accessible” film in his filmography, especially the Miyazaki “purists,” it is the film with the most heart out of the rest. It’s the type of film that almost hurts to love. You feel so vulnerable watching this, yet you feel a sense of awe because you're mesmerized by how much Miyazaki put sublime creativity into making Spirited Away. From all of its likable characters, brilliant pacing, memorable score, and a great coming of age story, from what minor minimal flaws there are to be found in the film, it is all worthwhile to take in what is grandeur and admire it wholeheartedly. Like its atmosphere, nostalgia is part of how special Spirited Away is. Not nostalgia in the sense of how you were a kid when you first saw it, but from how it invokes nostalgia from the film’s ambiance of showcasing childhood curiosity and adventure. Something which more kids films need to learn from in future generations.\\n\\nGrade: A+\",\n",
       " 'At the time of this writing, Spirited Away is ranked #2 among anime movies on this site. In my opinion, that is sorely inaccurate. Reading the reviews for it, there are a lot of remarks about the excellent animation and soundtrack (rightfully so) and the strong character design (understandably so), but beyond that, the praise begins to falter. People struggle to justify the disjointed nature of the film, sometimes going with \"shows remarkable creativity\" and sometimes just falling back on \"makes me nostalgic.\" Viewers who liked it don\\'t know why they liked it, and that doesn\\'t surprise me. In short, Spirited Awayfeels like a three hour recreation of someone\\'s dream that was carelessly edited down to two hours for the sake of runtime.  For starters, the movie has no true plot.  Chihiro (the protagonist) has lost her parents in a spirit world and needs to get them back and escape.  With that as a distant theme, the movie proceeds to throw characters and situations at us that are only tangentially connected to each other or that goal.\\n\\nAre there high points along the way? Absolutely.  The animation far surpasses the usual anime standard.  The musical composition is excellent.  The characters are unique and well-defined.  Everything is vivid and bombastic and well-done...except for an actual STORY.\\n\\nI\\'m afraid the only way to properly explain my issue is with specific examples from the film, so there are spoilers ahead.  You\\'ve been warned.\\n\\nLet\\'s start with Chihiro\\'s helper and guide, so to speak: Haku.  You begin to get an impression that he\\'s someone like her - someone who got lost in the spirit world but managed to survive by becoming Yubaba\\'s assistant.  He helps Chihiro get on her feet and avoid trouble, and then promptly ceases to be anything more than a plot device.  Haku steals a trinket from Yubaba\\'s sister for a reason that\\'s both not fully explained and ultimately irrelevant.  Yubaba\\'s sister is angry enough to try to kill him, then just forgives him when the trinket is returned.  He promptly loses any interest in taking it again, remembers he\\'s a water spirit (...okay?), and that\\'s the last we hear about him.\\n\\nHow about No-Face? An interesting character, absolutely, but pointless overall.  Yes, there\\'s a scene where he helps Chihiro, but after that, he eats a bunch of people, spits them out, and becomes a seamstress.  Fun.\\n\\nCharacters don\\'t so much \"develop\" as they change into completely different people for the sake of the story.  People hate Chihiro...until they don\\'t.  There\\'s a baby that cries and throws fits because he\\'s worried about the germs outside...then he goes outside willingly and becomes a nice person.  The witches are angry one moment and friendly the next.\\n\\nAnd then there are all the little inconsistencies and allowances made for the sake of making the story work (or forgotten when it no longer matters).  For example, there\\'s a big deal made about the importance of names and how losing your name is losing your identity, but it\\'s only relevant for two characters: Chihiro and Haku.  Chihiro forgets her name but then sees it on a card and remembers it again.  Haku makes a big deal about how she needs to hang onto that card so she\\'ll always remember...and then it\\'s never touched on again.  Haku can\\'t remember his original name, and this is treated as significant, but then Chihiro figures it out for him and exactly nothing comes of it.\\n\\nSimply put, this is a mess of a movie that nonetheless gets praise because it\\'s presented well.  Perhaps I just don\\'t have the context to really understand it (for example, maybe there are lots of details I didn\\'t catch because I\\'m not familiar with Japanese culture or mysticism), but from my perspective, as someone who appreciates a good, coherent plot, Spirited Away fell utterly flat.',\n",
       " 'As an Oscar-nominated animated feature by a world renowned director and studio, everyone had high expectations for this movie. STORY - I rather liked the basic premise for this movie; it\\'s very simple and reminiscent of a lot of traditional Asian children\\'s stories, not to mention My Neighbor Totoro, with the whole moving away thing. In addition to Chihiro\\'s task of saving her parents, the story very quickly expands to include an assortment of other strange characters, all with their issues and goals, and there are times when we are completely wrapped up in these secondary characters\\' problems. This makes it almost seem like Spirited Awayshould have been a short anime series rather than a full-length film. The randomness of some of the side stories really disconnected from the main plot, and I felt like it was a bit too unfocused at times.\\n\\nStill, all of the subplots were entertaining, and if you look at the movie as a story of friendship and growth as well, then I suppose they could all be considered relevant. It also adds an element of realism to the film, since it\\'s sometimes difficult to concentrate solely on one matter when there\\'s so much else going on. The scatteredness of everything is also rather typical of Miyazaki\\'s style, so most fans are probably used to it anyway. In the end, it\\'s really just a matter of personal preference in the way of storytelling.\\n\\nCHARACTER - I\\'m not sure how much I actually sympathized with Chihiro. By now, if you\\'ve been reading any of my other reviews, you would know that I\\'m not a big fan of characters with spotless morals, and Chihiro is one of them. She always knows what the right thing to do is, is never greedy, and never does errs on the side of \"darkness,\" even for a little bit. This is especially evident in the No-Face incident. Being primarily a children\\'s movie, I can understand the need for a role model, but I also think it would be easier to relate to Chihiro if she made some mistakes.\\n\\nThe rest of the cast is a bit better with having varied principles. The ambiguity of Haku\\'s alliance was an interesting element that I enjoyed, though once again, it did irk me that Chihiro seemed unwaivering in her good judgment. Zeniiba and Yu-Baaba were rather generic as characters, but as a huge Alice in Wonderland fan, I did appreciate the references to the Duchess and her gigantic baby. The collection of creatures that came to follow Chihiro around were a little gimmicky, but they weren\\'t very important and were fun to watch, so I guess there really isn\\'t a point in critiquing that too much.\\n\\nARTSTYLE &amp; ARTWORK - I don\\'t think I\\'ve ever been a big fan of how people are drawn in Miyazaki\\'s style, but it\\'s bothered me the most in Spirited Away. Chihiro looks like a monkey to me. I can\\'t un-see it! That\\'s just me though, I know. The rest of the art is, as usual, gorgeous. All of the bath house guests, the creatures that appeared now and again, all of the details in the wrinkles and warts of the old women -- they were all great. And not to mention the detail in the environment! Every door and wall and floor and machine looked amazing, and if you paused the movie on a background, you could spend ten minutes just looking for and staring at all the little details that were included. It aways blows me away the kind of time and effort they spend on things that the audience only sees for about five seconds at a time. Just beautiful.\\n\\nMUSIC - I wouldn\\'t consider Spirited Away one of Joe Hisaishi\\'s best scores, especially not compared to something like Princess Mononoke. Still, the tracks were always very fitting and appropriate, fun when need be, suspenseful when need be, as should be expected of any soundtrack.\\n\\nVOICE ACTING - I\\'ve seen both the sub and dub. Stick with the former. Chihiro\\'s English voice just irritated the hell out of me, and while admittedly, her Japanese original isn\\'t all that much better, it\\'s somehow easier to bear. Haku\\'s English voice also could have been much better, and I really wasn\\'t impressed with how most of his lines were delivered. Zeniiba and Yu-Baaba had pretty nice English voices, but I think it\\'s a lot easier to cast for older characters since there isn\\'t as much variation to their voices. The Japanese performance isn\\'t outrageously amazing by any means, but it\\'s at least better than the dub.\\n\\nOVERALL - I liked Spirited Away. Though the pacing wasn\\'t that great and some parts dragged on for much longer than they should have, as long as you\\'re watching it with friends, it remains an entertaining film with lots of visual grandeur. And maybe if you emptied your head a bit and tried to think like a kid, you\\'d enjoy it just a little more, rather than being a grouchy, old critic like me. D;',\n",
       " 'By far my favorite Miyazaki film, Spirited Away transported me to a place that I never wanted to leave. The visuals of this film are simply astounding. The colorful landscapes and the ornate buildings really brought the films story to life. The music was also extremely excellent. The characters were the best part of the film. Each one had their own story to tell. Most people might write this film off as a childrens movie, but in my opinion this is a movie that everyone- adults included- can watch and enjoy.',\n",
       " 'As I\\'m aging everyday, I felt the need to reminisce about my childhood past, and so recently I decided to re-watch a whole bunch of Disney movies as well as Miyazaki (Studio Ghibili) films. (By the way, did you guys hear that Studio Ghibili is no more? Depressing news for future generations). The movies brought me to tears, and I couldn\\'t help but feel an urge to write a review on how significantly emotional and magnificent Miyazaki\\'s films are. Spirited Away is definitely by far the most popular of all Miyazaki\\'s films considering he won a countless number of awards for the movie and itmade more profit than Titanic in Japan at the time. For parents I\\'d definitely recommend you watch this movie with your children, and children of all ages, if you haven\\'t seen Spirited Away yet in your life, I\\'d definitely urge you to watch it before you grow too old to enjoy it\\'s purity, because watching it from a child\\'s point of view will leave a tender childhood memory in your life. Watching it from an adult\\'s point of view will make you appreciate the movie (as well as other Miyazaki films) in a whole new light and bring back touching memories.\\n\\nThe story of Spirited Away doesn\\'t exactly seem all that children-like, because of it\\'s mysterious and somewhat complex plot. It\\'s about a 10-year old girl and her journey into a supernatural world filled with spirits --&gt; witches, ghosts, divine deities, a human-spirit-dragon and more, in order to rescue her parents who have been turned into pigs. Throughout her \"Alice in Wonderland\" - like adventure, she has to find her identity, remember her name, remain her purity/innocence while all the meanwhile remembering what it means to be a human being/a child. Unlike most anime directors or any filmmakers for that matter, Miyazaki doesn\\'t conceal the nightmares/terrors of childhood, which actually yield their own disquieting beauty. He respects the deep silences of his story, as well as its cacophonies. Very young children are apt to be frightened by this film but still enjoy the film if watching with a parent/older figure, proof being myself. But as children grow older and re-watch Spirited Away, they\\'ll come to appreciate it\\'s stunning beauty in story, art and sound. \\n\\nWhat Spirited Away does with it\\'s characters is truly magical. Unlike most anime, Spirited Away successfully portrays it’s characters in a more personal and intimate way. Obviously Anime characters often come off more like set pieces in a story than real, breathing people who control their own lives. But in Spirited Away, for all it’s insanity and typically over the top anime mysticism, the characters are surprisingly quietly intimate. This allows the audience to connect with, sympathize with and actually care to watch for Chichiro. But there are other characters too of some whom are symbolic characters and serve to teach the audience a lesson, of others who are there for kid\\'s enjoyment - comedy, and others who develop into an important piece of the plot; everyone has some kind of important role to look out for. With all these positives said, there wasn\\'t really a character I really loved, but the development of Chichiro really made her a special character.\\n\\nHonestly, the story is great and the characters were animated/imaginative, not-realistic creations of truly \"realistic\" beings. But for Miyazaki\\'s films, what can be said more than the animations and in my opinion, the greatest soundtracks in any films ever. Spirited Away\\'s animation was nothing short of masterful; High quality doesn\\'t begin to describe how simply stunning Spirited Away\\'s art is. The setting of Spirited Away has a very traditional Japanese feel to it while mixing in elements of modernity as well. The animations gives the audience a sense of fresh realism in a fantasy world. And the music. Oh my the music. Joe Hisaishi, you are the greatest movie-soundtrack composer ever and without having to say, my personal favorite movie-soundtrack composer. One Summer\\'s Day? Always With You? Sixth Shop? Dragon Boy? Your great music knows no limit. For those of you who have seen Spirited Away know what I\\'m talking about, and for those of you who don\\'t... Well then go to YouTube and listen to the pieces I just mentioned. The music definitely enhances the emotions felt from each scene, and makes the movie an all the more memorable experience/memory. The voice acting added a sense of realism into characters, especially Chichiro who genuinely sounded like a fightened 10 year old child. The beauty of the sounds in Spirited Away cannot be described in words.\\n\\nIf you want to purely enjoy this movie and/or haven\\'t seen the movie yet, then I recommend you skip these upcoming paragraph and skip just to the very last paragraph. because I will be analyzing the whole load of themes and symbols in Spirited Away, which is truly a childrens movie, while not actually being purely a childrens movie. There are just so many themes in Spirited Away beyong the surface of a magical masterpiece. \\n\\n1. Chichiro aka Sen was stripped of her name. But what does a name really mean though, it\\'s just a 2-couple of words assigned to you at birth right? You can just change it too right? Well, in Spirited Away, the character\\'s names are their quest for freedom. Sen Chichiro must remember the qualities that make her who she is and remain true to them despite her name, the one word that defines her as herself, has changed. In Spirited Away, names are of fundamental importance in the spirit world, and those in power keep their control by stealing and changing names. Only those characters with the inner strength to hold onto their names and identities can free themselves. \\n\\n2. What defines a person as good or evil? In Spirited Away, every character morally ambiguous; they\\'re a mix of good and bad qualities and actions.Those who seem good at first, such as Haku and No-Face, have their share of evil qualities, and those who seem bad in the beginning, such as Zeniba, and Lin, show signs of good in Chihiro’s escape to freedom. Chihiro herself is pretty unpleasant at first until later when she reveals her better nature only after she becomes Sen. Spirited Away’s blurred line between good and evil is a much more accurate reflection of the real world outside the film. In the end, evil is not vanquished but pushed aside as characters make choices that weaken bad influences. Sen’s acts of goodness bring out the latent good in those she encounters; just like real life right? \\n\\n3. Growing Up, and entering the world of adulthood. What does it mean to be a child? What separates a child from a teen from an adult? The shock of entering the working world is a theme rarely dealt with at this age level, which gives Spirited Away a mark of distinction. At the beginning of the movie, Chichiro is just sitting in the backseat doing nothing while her parents drive, and she just follows other spirits instructions. But as the story progresses, she starts to make decisions for herself and instead of idly doing nothing, she has to enter the working field and work diligently. Though hard work is not the only element of the spirit world that transforms Sen into a stronger, more capable person, it certainly helps her learn to deal with problems maturely.\\n\\n4. Human Nature\\'s greed. At the beginning of the film greed is on full display as Chihiro whines and complains to her parents (children\\'s greed for attention) meanwhile, Chihiro’s parents’ greed leads them to eat a whole ton of (unpaid) food that eventually turns them into pigs. Literally every character in Spirited Away is greedy from a small scale to a large scale; Haku being the \"good-guy\" character and all is greedy for power to match Yubabu, the evil witch\\'s power, and Yubabu is so greedy for total control of the spirit realm and gold/gold/gold, eventually leads to the destruction and chaos in the story. She even loses what she covets most as retribution for her greed. In every case, greed makes characters oblivious to what is truly important, preventing them from reaching their full potential as people and spirits. This is a reflection of human society no?\\n\\n5. Life and Death. Water represents entrapment and freedom; life and death. Chihiro\\'s realizarion that the previously dry ground is now a huge body of water of which she cannot cross. Reflection that you can\\'t run away from fate- Life and Death. In order to survive in the spirit world, Sen works at the bathhouse, which depends on water for its livelihood. In the course of Sen’s work, she rescues a polluted river spirit by pouring liberal amounts of water over him - life. Sen nearly drowns in the process, but the spirit places her in a protective bubble that keeps her from harm, and this and other acts of kindness play a role in her liberation. But beyond just the use of water, the constant struggle between living and dying - and what it means to be alive (a magical thing) and what it means to be dead (who knows what this means) is on full display.\\n\\nThis movie is truly wild runs of children\\'s imagination/fantasies all put into one film; I personally believe after watching nearly all of Miyazaki/Studio Ghibili\\'s films, Spirited Away was the single mof innovative and imaginative story by far. Growing up is a beautiful thing, and this movie is a pretty personal movie to me. My entire analysis of all Story, Art, Sound, and Character for Spirited Away can be summed up in entirely one word: \"Beautiful~\" And this movie, as a child, as a teen and now as an adult never ceases to remain as one of the most enjoyable movies ever.',\n",
       " \"Unfortunately, the movie that introduced 'mainstream' America to Miyazaki is not as good as it has been advertised. Story: The story itself is rather underwhelming; a small spoiled brat is 'spirited away' to, well, the spirit world, her life as she knows it is suddenly in danger, and she has to overcome her selfishness in order to get back to her world, all the time helping and being helped by an attractive young male spirit who is actually a dragon...did you catch all the cliches in there? Art: This is the movie's one saving grace. Miyazaki was always known for his fantastic animation, and Spirited Away isno exception. The scenery is breathtakingly realistic, and despite the two-dimensional characters, could almost be mistaken for live-action if one were to not be careful. \\n\\nSound: The music is relatively bland; no really noticeable or memorable moments in the score. For once I prefer the sound effects to the actual soundtracks. It is also worth noting that the voice actors usually speak all their lines with one monotonous emotion. This is not inherently their fault, though, as will be explained in the next section.\\n\\nCharacter: The movie's weakest point by far. None of the characters are likeable, except the minor ones, and maybe the animals. Sympathy for Chihiro doesn't really grow as the movie progresses, which is no doubt the opposite effect the filmmakers wanted. The spirit Haku is also an offender here; as cool as we are supposed to think he is, this is hindered by his all-around boring-ness.\\n\\nEnjoyment/Overall: In the middle of recording this for my family to watch later, I had to just cancel it after realizing how disappointing the film was. What was I expecting? Well, maybe a movie that had a storyline that was taken further, characters that actually develop and manage to be likeable, and an interesting musical score. Is that too much to ask? If you haven't already fallen prey to Miyazaki mania with this one, I would say just skip it. Not missing much.\",\n",

       " \"Spirited Away was one of my first anime. I remember my mom came home from the movie store with it one day. It was a pleasant surprise for me to find that such a film exists. After it ended I said to myself, this isn't like any other animated films I had ever seen before . . . and then I watched it a second time. Visually, I believe this is Hayao Miyazaki's best film. Everything is a joy to look at. The soundtrack of Spirited Away is one of my favorite anime soundtracks. This is one of the many strengths of the film. I feelthat this is the best of Joe Hisaishi's works as well.\\n\\nWhen the soundtrack and visuals come together, it makes all the little things in the film so much more special. The scene where Chihiro is on the train with No Face is one of my favorite scenes in the film. Something this simple can be so great only because of the connection between audio and animation.\\n\\nSome people have said the story was confusing. For me, it was not all that hard to follow. Maybe that comes from having seen it so many times.\\n\\nSpirited Away is a strange and unique anime that absolutely blew me away. The kind of film you can watch over and over again. It sparked my interest in anime and the works of Hayao Miyazaki. I cannot praise this film enough.\",\n",
       " '[10/10] _____________________________________________________________________________________________________ Years ago, I took my first steps into my college dormitory. It was beige, undecorated, and musty, one of the many dorms that stood side-by-side in the repurposed theatre building. I felt numb, barely recalling the goodbye I uttered to my parent’s moments ago. A nervous mother, a proud father, an anxious grandmother, each face ushering me into a new world, one without their support. I remembered my previous graduating class of seven students and how poorly my high school prepared me for my new class of hundreds. I remembered how familiar everything felt, and how comfortable I was just last night. Chihiro is similarto me, to all of us, really. She’s uprooted from her past, her school, her comfort, and thrust into a new town, new people, new expectations. Her parents offer consoling thoughts, ones which are echoed by every parent. The banal, trite notions of betterment; the cascading compliments and reassuring nods that would seemingly work on a child, but ultimately do nothing but stoke the flames of anxiety. They’re excited, yet you aren’t, and she isn’t. And so, the parent’s vapid confidence and false encouragement is annihilated at the hands of the new world. Chihiro’s father takes a detour and they stumble upon an old, decrepit tunnel, one which he declares as a path they should take. \\n\\nThrough the darkness they trot, Chihiro clutching helplessly at her mother’s sleeve, begging to turn back. They continue, figuratively leaving their child behind, and lurching to the exit which leads them into a gargantuan field of green. An old amusement park, the father remarks and points them to a nearby town. A towering building at its edge acts as the climax to the settlement, however, for all its ageing beauty, it seems to house no one and nothing beyond some freshly cooked food. Food, which in the parent’s gluttonous assuredness, is there to be consumed by them. After her pleading does her no good, Chihiro decides to explore, as any child would. It doesn’t take long until a boy, Haku, greets her, but the greeting is short-lived, as he remarks on the sunset and orders her to run before night time. Chihiro, blinded by confusion and fear, attempts to find her parents. The sun sets, the dilapidated buildings begin coming to life, as their lights flicker on and spirits shimmer into existence. She shouts for her family, yet they are nowhere to be seen. It isn’t until she stumbles upon that same food stand that she notices her parents have become pigs, engorged by their food, not recognizing her. \\n\\nChihiro is spirited away, wisped and torn from comfort twice, an otherworldly experience being the catalyst for her anxiety and discomfort manifesting into dread and horror. She cowers, away from the spirits, the fantastical creatures that just sprung to life, and does her best not to be seen. It isn’t until that same boy, Haku, finds her, that she’s given her first sense of motivation and assuredness that isn’t stooped in well-intentioned but fraudulent optimism. She’s in danger, but she can succeed. \\n\\nMiyazaki is a god in the medium. Beyond simply being the one to disseminate anime across the world, Miyazaki has a certain dogmatic, old-school appreciation of art and animation. He dislikes computers, the complexity they remove, prompting instead to express himself through naturalism as seen through the spectrum of computer generation versus hand drawn. Through this specific, touted approach, Miyazaki makes immensely personal films. Personal not only in ideas, but in presentation, as the art is often granular, sharp, and intertwined seamlessly with the fantasy world. He pulls from museums, which he often visited during his creation process, as the pseudo-western style often depicted in Meiji-era architecture influenced him heavily. That towering, Meiji-era building at the edge of town, connected by a lone bridge which leads its inhabitants there, is a bathhouse owned by the greedy witch, Yubaba. \\n\\nBeyond his visual intention, Miyazaki’s personalization was established before creation even began. He remarked about how he spent many summers in a mountain cabin with his family and five girls, and how they influenced him. Their wishes for growth, not physically, but from the inner-spirit, were beliefs which stemmed from certain situations, such as Chihiro’s, that draw from something that’s already within you. The irony being that Chihiro’s alien experience, so different from the rest of her life, is what causes her to grow spiritually. \\n\\nThe trials she faces are reflections of what being lost is. The will not to be seen in crowds, for example; as Haku tells her to hold her breath on the bridge to the bathhouse so she isn’t spotted. Of course, her anxiety gives way and her fears become palpable. Her journey is inner as much as it is outer, as reflected by her inching her way down a steep staircase to reach the boiler room. Her fear prevents her from making any progress, just one step down proving to be far too daunting. It isn’t until the staircase begins crumbling, splintering underneath her that she is sent screaming down, running for her life, yet making it out without as much as a scratch. Her inner growth persists through a scene-by-scene basis, as the moments after involve a similar trial. She observes the dust sprites throwing coal into the boiler as an initially frightening spider-man, Kamaji, makes his usual rounds. Chihiro is forced to make an introduction, one step, as proven visually, is not enough.\\n \\nThis is how Miyazaki mastered his narrative craft, as he finds ways to show the coming of age story which speaks to kids, not down to them. There is no abrasive comedic relief character thrust into scenes simply to have someone lighten the mood through stilted remarks or the usual self-aware pandering which plague so many modern animated films. There’s only the Chihiro, her story, and the world at our eye line. His willingness to let his scenes breath, giving them space to exist beyond simply serving an expository or comedic purpose, is exactly what grounds his fantastical narratives. When there is drama and trepidation, it isn’t bookended by a gag. \\n\\nIt is no coincidence Miyazaki chose a bathhouse as the central force of his narrative, as spiritual healing is directly related to ablution. As read by the Japanese myth of the Buddha and the Bathwater, where a Japanese monk encounters a Bodhisattva and, through his own trial, becomes “the holy man of the hot springs”. Hot springs and, tangentially, bathhouses are linked to physical and mental cleansing, as there is a conscious transformation of mind and soul which comes from the earth. They act as reagents for change, a change which in Chihiro’s case, is initially unintentional and bred from fear. Fear giving access to formative experiences isn’t a new concept, as the majority of character-building drama and, more realistically, mentality-changing experiences within the real world, are birthed off the backs of great stress, anxiety, and self-doubt. Formative experiences must hinge on moments of weakness facilitating new-found strength. \\n\\nAs Chihiro is faced with the most frightening trials of all, she finds that same inner strength and spirit that Miyazaki comments on, and uses it to spur spiritual growth. She’s still a ten-year-old girl by the end of the Spirited away, but one more capable of self-sustaining. While Spirited Away is palatable for all, what Miyazaki does, once again, is personal. A coming of age story that depends on overcoming the fear of the unknown. The notion that even in a situation where there is nothing to recognize, you can find something in yourself to succeed through. \\n\\nI reflect on Spirited Away the same way I reflect on myself years ago, taking that first step into a dormitory. I was left alone in a city I’ve never been to, around people I’ve never met. The first year felt like Chihiro’s descent down the fracturing staircase, and similar to her, once I landed on solid ground I realized just how little I’ve been hurt in the process. As she did, the future steps forward I took more confidently, with more vigor and determination, reaching inward to grow spiritually. So, looking back, I remember the doubt, the anxiety, and the unease. I remember my first friends and how rigorous my studies were.  I remember how familiar everything came to feel, and how comfortable I was just last night.',\n",
       " \"Spirited Away Spirited Away is about a 10-year-old girl named Chihiro who with her parents, enters an ominous looking tunnel that leads them to a mysterious town filled with restaurants. Chihiro's parents are quick sit down and begin eating. Unable to get through to them that they should leave, Chihiro wanders off and comes across what she recognizes as a bathhouse where a young boy suddenly appears and warns her to leave before nightfall. However, as the sun sets, the town begins to fill up with Spirits, and Chihiro returns to find that her parents have undergone a mysterious transformation.

With help from friends, will Chihiro succeed in her quest to save her parents and leave the mysterious town? Watch the movie and find out. \\n\\nMy Thoughts:\\nSpirited Away is one of Hayao Miyazaki's best works. I so enjoyed this movie. Chihiro grows from a self-centered girl to one of courage and willingness to put others before herself. The graphics in the movie are awesome and the characters are simply superb. Spirited Away may seem at first a child's movie but it isn't, it's a family movie and worth watching.\",\n",
       " 'I\\'m sorry, with respect to what he\\'s accomplished, Miyazaki can\\'t tell a good story to save his life. As a test, ask someone who loves Spirited Away for a brief wiki-style synopsis and see if they can do it. Probably not, but it\\'s not their fault; it\\'s a plot based on coincidences and contrivances. The sentimentalism is manipulative & manufactured (aww, the old spider guy has developed a grandfatherly attachment to the protagonist for no reason! etc) and the usually great Joe Hisaishi is reduced to sappy Disney style orchestral \"emotional scene #50\" muzak. At a bloated two hours, I don\\'t think good visuals areenough.',\n",
       " \"I've discussed a lot of Studio Ghibli films in the past, and I'll probably touch on more in future. Surprisingly one of their best known films, Spirited Away, hasn't come up yet. It was written and directed by Miyazaki Hayao with production beginning in 2000 and the eventual release in 2001 breaking box office records and winning various awards. Of course, something being popular doesn't necessarily translate to it being good. Although it's a Miyazaki Hayao film so the probability of it being ungood is exceedingly low. Either way, let's take a look. Story: Our tale opens with a family driving to their new home. The fathergets lost and goes down a side street, eventually coming across a worn down tunnel. They arrive at a strange deserted area and find large plates piled with food at an abandoned stall. Our heroine, the young Chihiro, encourages her parents not to eat it because whoever runs the stall is going to get mad at them, but her parents help themselves because she is the only one in the group with common sense. She wanders off and encounters a young boy who tells her that she can't be there and to hurry and get across the river before night falls. She finds it strange but does as she's told. Unfortunately, when she goes looking for her parents all she finds are a couple of massive pigs and by the time she reaches the river it's stretched out far wider than it was before and she has no way to cross it. She finds herself in a strange land full of spirits with no way home. If she wants to avoid getting turned into an animal like her parents then she has to find work. The main conflict centres around Chihiro's struggle to save her parents and return home.\\n\\nAs rare as it is for me, I have nothing about the story to criticise. The quiet atmospheric scenes are really effective at establishing information about the world, and helping build tension. It's a good thing they didn't do something stupid like throw in narration or chatter because that would have just destroyed the lovely atmosphere. The pacing is spectacular. The narrative itself is highly compelling with a lot of interesting moments. The spirit world is fascinating and the story structure is really good with a very natural progression. I suppose that I could say that the ending is kind of obvious if I wanted to nitpick but in all fairness I can't really fault a children's movie for that especially when everything that builds up to it works so well and the ending itself has a lot of really good aspects and works very well. It may be obvious, but it's still a good ending.\\n\\nCharacters:\\n\\nChihiro is a really interesting heroine with a good amount of complexity and she does develop quite a bit over the course of the film. It has strong coming of age elements and it handles them spectacularly. The secondary cast also has a lot of complex and interesting characters. Even the little soot ball creatures have some facets to them. I do like that the antagonist isn't some stock villain cliché but is more just kind of greedy and self-centred while having some sympathetic traits as well.\\n\\nArt:\\n\\nUnsurprisingly, the artwork is spectacular. I've never seen a Studio Ghibli film that didn't look gorgeous. The backgrounds are lovely. The various spirits are really well designed and have interesting looks. I particularly liked No Face and the dragon. The action sequences are really well done.\\n\\nSound:\\n\\nThe cast is really good. Irino Miyu, yes the same gent who was in hoshi wo ou kodomo, Hiiragi Rumi, and Natsuki Mari are all really good. And Natsuki voices two different characters who deliberately sound kind of similar but she gives them both subtly different qualities that make them sound believably like different people. The music is really good as well.\\n\\nHo-yay:\\n\\nNo ho-yay in this one either.\\n\\nFinal Thoughts:\\n\\nSpirited Away is certainly a spectacular film. It's easy to see why it made such an impact and has garnered so much praise. The story is amazing, the characters are complex, the artwork is beautiful and the acting and music are both superb. I wouldn't call it better than Nausicca or Grave of the Fireflies but it's certainly a masterpiece in its own right and easily on par with them. As such, my final rating is going to be a 10/10. Tomorrow I'll finish up film festival week with a look at Miyamoto Musashi: Souken ni Haseru Yume.\",\n",
       " \"No matter how you approach a review for this movie, this will always be one of the greatest animes ever made. It has fluid artwork and strong characters. And it eschews from typical anime stereotypes. Most importantly, it has a strong moral point about growing up. For some unknown reason, I have heard a lot of criticism about this anime, in that people think that it's no different from anything else that Studio Ghibli has released. Any other anime by Studio Ghibli has not won an &quot;Academy Award For Best Animation&quot;. Nor has any other Ghibli work been ranked as the best animation title byIMDB. \\n\\nNaysayers will cite Western narrow mindedness. I say nay. By now, anime has become such a phenomenon in the West. And more than enough smart people in the West know enough about what makes a good anime. And most of them would agree that Spirited Away has the makings of a good anime and that it is one of the best animes they will ever see.\\n\\nGive respect where respect is due. At least give this anime a try. It's a travesty that a piece of art like this is not getting the amount of fame it deserves. You know who to blame (are you listening Naruto fans?).\\n\\nFinal Grade:\\nA\",\n",
       " \"Giving this a 10/10 is the equivalent of giving Dora The Explorer a 10/10. Woah, woah easy don't kill me!! Yes, yes it's a masterpiece I get it! The only people I would recommend Ghibli films in this case: Spirited Away to are people who have a hard on for ambiguous themes and kids under 8. Or casual movie goers who like them pretty colours.If you do not like pretty colours and ambiguous themes, this movie is and will be a huge disappointment for you.\\n\\nOr maybe not since it's a Hayao Miyazaki film by Ghibli.\\n\\nAnd you would consider it a masterpiece regardless of watching the movie or not.\\n\\n*Review*\\n\\nHere's my issue with Spirited Away.\\n\\nIt panders to everyone without a focus. Which is why everyone has a reason to give this show a 10/10.\\n\\nOn the one hand it's a Ghibli Family Mindless Fun Film with a soulless narrative.\\n\\nOn the other hand it's symbolism on prostitution, selling your soul, growth and social commentary on consumerism and unhappiness, change yada yada [Insert your interpretation].\\n\\nAnd then the pretty colours.\\n\\nThis is why Ghibli films is not my cup of tea. \\n\\nIt does not excel in anything. It just sticks to the formula in accordance to popular trends of what makes a movie successful. \\n\\nThen you get all these casual movie goers being pedaled into thinking or calling this movie a masterpiece for [Insert Random Reason] cuz their daughters and elitist critics rated this high instead of truly loving it by their own terms.\\n\\n\\ntldr; Recommended for everyone but me.\",\n",
       " 'It almost feels unnecessary for me to review this movie. Everybody knows about it. Everybody (who knows what they’re talking about) knows it’s a masterpiece. Is there really anything else I can add to the discussion surrounding this movie? No, but I still wanna talk about it anyway because I love this movie & actually have yet to review a Studio Ghibli movie. But first a little history. I originally watched Spirited Away for the first time back in 2018 a few months after I had just gotten into anime proper & knew who Hayao Miyazaki was. More importantly though, I knew the reputation thismovie had going into. I watched it….. &amp; I liked it. I’ll be honest I wasn’t overly impressed with it or saw why it garnered its reputation, but I enjoyed the film overall. Though I did watch it the same day I watched Akira for the first time, which at the time, I thought was a completely incomprehensible piece of shit. That stance has changed since then but the point is, I would’ve thought anything was good coming off Akira the exact same day I watched it. Going forward in life I just kinda moved on &amp; didn’t think about Spirted Away too much. But in 2019 as I realized I was running out of Studio Ghibli movies to watch (as in I was close to seeing all of them). I went on a sort of Ghibli binge &amp; started to not only watch the ones I missed, but even rewatched some of my favorites/ones I wanted to get a new opinion on, &amp; thus brings us back to Spirted Away. I rewatched it….. &amp; I fucking loved it. Whatever prevented me from really seeing Spirited Away as a masterpiece back then no longer applied, I was enthralled with movie &amp; for a week I couldn’t take my mind off of it. I know this introduction was rather lengthy but I honestly felt this was necessary because I wanted to apply some groundwork as to why this is now my second favorite, &amp; at times my favorite Miyazaki movie of all time. Spoilers inbound btw\\n\\nI think what I love most about Spirited Away is the narrative, but more so the narrative structure. I love coming of age stories &amp; Spirited Away is one of the best in my honest opinion. Chihiro does start out as an unlikable brat, but what do you expect? She’s only 10, has to move away to a different town from all her friends, &amp; then gets thrusted into this fantasy world that she knows nothing about, &amp; on top on top of that, is filled with all these weird fantasy creatures that nobody knows about. But throughout the movie we get to see Chihiro adapt to this environment. We see her overcome these impossible odds. We get to see her grow up. It’s simplicity executed to perfection &amp; what makes this story even better is the storyboarding. If there’s one thing Hayao Miyazaki is a master at it’s crafting/mapping settings. I won’t bore you with excessive details like how Chihrio exactly got from outside the bath house to Yubaba’s room. But I feel like if Yubaba’s bath house was a real place that I could visit I would know the layout exactly &amp; wouldn’t have to consult anybody thanks to Miyazaki’s storyboarding. The world just builds together &amp; flows so fluently that I was never lost, I knew exactly where I was at all times. But even better is the pacing. This movie is just right, it knows exactly how long it needs to stay somewhere, it knows exactly when to transition into the next scene, &amp; it knows how to keep me engaged &amp; never question how much longer I have left in the movie. This movie is 2 hours long but I was never bored because of how excently paced the movie was. What else needs to be addressed is the world building. I more or less alluded to it when talking about the storyboarding but can we take a moment to appreciate how meticulously crafted this world is? From the pig farms, the market where Chihiro’s parents turn into pigs, the aforementioned bathhouse, Yubaba’s office &amp; her baby’s room. The train station that takes Chirio &amp; No Face to Zeniba’s hut in the swamp. I remember everything about this world precisely because of the excellent worldbuilding. Miyazaki knows just how long he needs to keep us in these environments as to make them memorable. Hell, even the small town that Chirhio’s family is moving to at the beginning of the movie I can tell you about how the family even ends up in the Spirit world in the first place. I won’t pad with the details of course (this review is already pretty lengthy as it is, I’m 2 pages in &amp; I’m still talking about the story/world for fucks sake). I don’t know if I’ve said peace with this segment yet or not but Spirited Away is a very dense, layered world with a lot of meat to chew on &amp; for that I think it’s super commendable &amp; deserves respect.\\n\\nPhew, now that I’m done with that mouthful, I guess I should talk about the characters, which are also excellent. Honestly, none of them outside of Chihiro &amp; Haku really get development. But they don’t need to, as most of them serve a purpose in helping Chirhio find her way in this world &amp; keep her identity as so she doesn’t get trapped &amp; can’t go back to her world. All of them are not only characterized extremely well, but they’re also memorable and have easily identifiable character traits. Out of all the characters in this movie, my two favorites are Rin &amp; Zeniba. I like them the most because they’re guiding figures for Chihrio in this strange world. Rin is the tough love but caring type &amp; is like a sister figure for Chihiro. It kinda saddens me how Rin has long since lost her identity &amp; is destined to forever stay in the spirit world working for Yubaba, but I also like to think of that as Rin’s motivation for even helping Chihiro in the first place, she knows Chihiro really doesn’t belong in the spirit world &amp; wants to do whatever she can to help her keep afloat in this strange world &amp; make it back to her world safely. Zenida is Yubaba’s nicer sister that ends up helping Chihiro by revealing one of Yubaba’s secrets that will help Chihiro get back to her world. She’s a sweet &amp; loving granny figure even preferring that Chihiro call her such. She’s honestly such a sweet old woman, I almost think it would be worth going through what Chihiro went though in this movie just so I could go to her swamp &amp; have a conversation with her. But I can’t forget Haku, the guy who even helps Chihiro realize what kind of situation she’s in to begin with. He’s heroic, loyal to his friends, &amp; caring, but he’s also not afraid to stand up to authority going against Yubaba directly at several points in the movie. It’s actually revealed near the end of the movie that Haku is the spirit of the Kohaku river, a river that Chirio almost drowned in as a child. It’s hinted throughout the movie that Chihiro &amp; Haku have a stronger connection than it originally seems &amp; when this is revealed, it hits hard. Even the minor characters in this movie such as Kamajii, the human spider who’s the heart of the bathhouse as he operates the mechanisms this bathhouse needs to even run in the first place. The three heads of Yubaba who have a really funny scene in the movie where their disguise getting revealed by Yubaba results in them hopping out the room making “hup hup hup” sounds. The way this scene is directed &amp; the way they exit the room inparticular with the same expression they had on their faces earlier just makes me laugh everytime I think about it. I’d of course be remiss if I didn’t talk about Yubaba. Yubaba, isn’t exactly my favorite Ghibli villain, I don’t think she’s as layered as Kushana from the Nausicaa movie. Or in a somewhat unique position for an antagonist like Fujimoto from Ponyo (as in he’s not really a bad guy more so an overprotective father who tries his best). But I do think she is written well &amp; isn’t just a blank face evil villain. She’s not a nice person but I at least understand her motivations &amp; where she’s coming from. The reason she has to operate her bathhouse on such a constant schedule is because spirts often come to be cleansed of their wrongdoings or what have-you so that they can then pass on &amp; leave the spirt world in peace. Her bathhouse prevents Chaos from spreading &amp; destroying the world essentially. She’s also a mother who tries her best to provide for her son too. She’s not exactly the most morally correct person but she’s not supposed to be. She’s supposed to be Chihiro’s greatest obstacle on he journey of both self discovery (at 10) and finding her way back home. I think I’ve covered about as much as I can with this segment. The characters in Spirited Away are excellent. Easily my favorite cast out of any Studio Ghibli just because of how memorable all of them are. \\n\\nI honestly really don’t know how I’m gonna talk about the art &amp; animation because I mean what is there to really say? It’s Studio Ghibli. We all know their animation is the best in the business, we all know the background art is extremely detailed, we all know the character designs have that charm with them, we all know about this stuff. I don’t think you really need me to repeat what others have said (as if I haven’t been doing that throughout this review). But alright, if you want me to explain why Spirited Away’s art and animation is phenomenal, just watch either one clip of the movie, or look at an image on google. Those two things will say more about this aspect than I ever could. I will however talk about the voice acting, which is excellent. Chihiro despite being a brat at the beginning of a movie has a somewhat soft-spoken demeanor to start off &amp; I really like that. The rest of the cast all bring their A game &amp; there isn’t one dull performance to be found throughout this movie. Even no faces moans just leave off this feeling that I can’t really describe but it’s there god-damnit. The music is of-course, spectacular. Shocker I know, but it’s so good. Joe Hisaishi doesn’t miss with his orchestration, his pianos, anything really. This man is so damn good at what he does &amp; the music matches the atmosphere of this music so perfectly I couldn’t imagine anybody else doing it.\\n\\nTo end it off. Spirited Away I think I can safely call my favorite Miyazaki/Ghibli movie. I just get so much out of it. I haven’t watched it since 2019 but as you can tell from this review, I still think about it so much. It’s a movie about self discovery, about life, about growing up. To quote Miyazaki “I would like to make a film to tell children its good to be alive.” Spirited Away is a movie that means a lot to me &amp; should not be dismissed. It needs to be watched by everyone. This isn’t just a good kids movie, it’s a good fucking movie no matter who you are &amp; it does in fact hold up. I don’t know how I’m supposed to end this exactly. But Miyazaki is a mastermind, this movie is a masterpiece. Uh yeah, I’m leaving lol.',\n",
       " \"Highest grossing film in Japanese history, winner of an American Academy award in 2002, and it's absolutely amazing. At it's heart, Spirited Away is a familiar story. Again, our young heroine learns to find her inner strength and comes of age after “falling down the rabbit hole” and finds herself on a liminal journey through the realm of the spirits. Again it proves Miyazaki’s talent as a director, storyteller, and visionary-- elevating a traditional narrative by just executing it perfectly. The lead character, Chihiro, excels as a heroine because her characterization is spot on. Miyazaki wanted to make a protagonistwho would be able to speak to ten year old girls-- a demographic which is usually not represented in the medium, since ten year old girls are no longer adorable little children, but have yet to enter what we properly think of as adolescence. It’s really nice to see a strong protagonist young girls can look up to.\\n  \\nIn addition to the coming of age story, Miyazaki also subtly folds in the difficulty of being able to consolidate traditional Japanese spirituality with modernity and the environmental theme pokes its head up again. And rather down the rabbit hole, Chihiro finds herself in a bathhouse for the spirits, allowing for really creative and fantastic visuals (and music; Joe Hisashi here is really at his best).\\n   \\nIt also needs to be lauded for putting Ghibli on the map in the United States. While Totoro, Kiki, and Princess Mononoke had their fans, it was Spirited Away that first received a theatrical release that a fair amount of people saw (albeit after it won the Academy Award). It caught the attention of not only anime fans, but a general audience was suddenly turned onto Miyazaki’s work. It was followed by movies like Howl, but more notably Ponyo and Arrietty which are more obvious examples of Disney’s marketing and releasing Ghibli films stateside; this film set the precedent though.\\n   \\nThis film is the perfect combination of mythical and reality; just the right amount of romance, action, tension, and those scenes where the movie quiets down and just allows us to take in the mood. It's truly a perfect movie, and one that everybody (anime fan or not) can enjoy.\",\n",
       " 'I didn\\'t really like this film, I wasn\\'t \"transported\" by the story and what was being told. I admit that there are some very good ideas, but they didn\\'t interest me.

That\\'s just my opinion, because if you put aside my appreciation of the film, it objectively/honestly deserves a 9/10 or even a 10/10 for those who loved it, but I personally didn\\'t enjoyit too much. \\n\\nFor those who are interested, I think it\\'s a must-see film, it\\'s unique and worth the time to watch.',\n",
       " \"(No spoilers contained) Sen to Chihiro no Kamikakushi also known as Spirited away, is one of the most famous anime movies, and of course, one of the best. I first saw this movie about 7 years ago when i was younger. And when i saw it, i NEVER wanted to stop watching it. A masterpiece from studio Ghibli. Story - 9 The story is pretty simple as you can read from the synopsis, but very interesting and the plot flaws nicely. Unique story and absolutely not predictable. I believe even if you don't like/enjoy the genres of the movie, i'm sure you're not going to dislike this movie,at least not by it's genres. Funny scenes not in a humiliated way and not too dramatic. And the ending is very nice with no plot holes.\\n\\nArt/Animation - 8 \\nThe animation is nice and it fits the movie. Pretty detailed, and it achieves the mood of the movie. The emotions of the characters are well drawn. Realistic design on both characters and landscapes. Also, there is no CGI.\\n\\nSound - 8\\nAwesome voice acting. The soundtracks and the backround music are awesome and everything fits with the movie. Every soundtracks is used in a perfect way. The right soundtrack for the right moment. Note: I've seen this movie mostly with English VAs. Only once with Japanese VAs.\\n\\nCharacter - 9\\nThe characters are very interesting and almost everyone has a unique characteristic. The villains have their own motivations and they are not there just to exist. The character develpoment on the protagonist is nice. Also, the supportive cast is awesome. Many of them are memorable.\\n\\nEnjoyment - 10\\nAs i said, even if you don't like the genres of this movie, i believe you'lll like it. You'll never get boring while watching it for the first time. I already watched this movie many times, and i'm sure you'll do the same thing. \\n\\nOverall - 10\\nThe younger you watch this movie, the better. That's what i believe. It won the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature at the 75th Academy Awards, the Golden Bear at the 2002 Berlin International Film Festival (tied with Bloody Sunday) and is among the top ten in the BFI list of the 50 films you should see by the age of 14.

       " \"• My grasp on why people consider Spirited Away great. Spirited Away is a collection of events where there is never a dull moment, in a world filled with the supernatural. It is filled to the brim with characters with interesting designs accompanied by fairy tale like traits, giving the movie a way to hook the viewers due to them having experienced things of this kind already. Unlike those stories however, while the characters still have plenty of traits blown out of proportions, they aren't either morally good or morally bad, with no cartoon-ish levels of zeal or evil attached to them. Each characters have anestablished motivation that is their own and establishes them as working in the world, which is rarely expected in a movie targeting really young audiences.\\n\\nThe movie follows a kid's experience through a world filled with danger at every turn, that forces her to adapt to everything at each passing moment. Her portrayal is realistic and understandable, nailed down from body language, to mentality, to her reaction to the events. This makes her quite relatable, due to the fact that everyone as a kid, has been at least to some extent, just like her. And seeing her react to each passing element that hasn't been part of her life with awe and fear manages to create a compelling character, due to her reactions feeling genuine.\\n\\nSeeing a spoiled cowardly child, portrayed as such, strongly from the very start, adapt to a world filled with supernatural beings where she never really has a dull moment where she is completely safe, and then growing into a character that will repay the people that helped her, is something that most people can enjoy. As a result of such, many admire her strong portrayal, as well as her strong development.\\n\\nThe movie does a good job at presenting how daunting a new world of which you know nothing about can be to an uninitiated child, and also at presenting it with some amazing artistic portrayal, filled with varied designs and a lot of minute details that breath more life into the world. It shows a world that is fascinating, and that can leave you awestruck.\\n\\n• What I think of Spirited Away\\n\\nSpirited Away is a narrative mess.\\n\\nThe fact that there is never a dull moment in Spirited Away, does make it entertaining for the first half of the movie, but when it decides to suddenly make its protagonist, from a snotty spoiled brat into someone courageous that suddenly who's only goal is to fix everyone's problems, presented with fearlessness uncharacteristic of the character, I wondered if I'm still watching the same movie, due to there being no moment where the movie takes a moment to explain itself. Due to the fact that the events are so chaotic and there isn't really any overarching plot, Spirited Away pretty much fills like a couple of scenes that weren't really edited in together well. They look stunning, there doesn't seem to be anything wrong with them individually, but when you try to follow a narrative thread or see any development in the events, all you find is chaos.\\n\\nFor the first half of the movie, the movie was ok. The fact that the events were chaotic was fine as it was only a means of showing the protagonist wasn't safe, that the world was rich and to keep the audience engaged by having constant artistic elements introduced, such as various unique character designs. But then, once she settles in, and we get to Act B of the movie, her former flaws, all dissapear, in order for the movie to be able to conclude, with no moment of self reflection or progression towards defining what made her get over herself. What I watched no longer mattered to me simply because I wasn't watching the same character progress through the story. I started with Chihiro, a girl that was too afraid to go in a tunnel and was complaining about her flowers at the beginning of her movie, going right into, Chihiro, this really courageous girl willing to go through dangerous situations to save her family and friends. Where did the courage come out of? Whatever it is, it was never shown in the movie.\\n\\nI did enjoy the movie from an artistical sense however, and I agree with everyone that it looks great. And everything in the movie, builds upon this and tries to showcase as much stuff that is visually stunning as possible, to convey emotion. But in order to make a story coherent, you should focus on the events at hand, on the actual story and what influenced things to spring that way. Not to say the characters don't have motivations, but the events really don't tie together in order to tell a story, they simply just happen. Nobody really learns anything, it's just a chaotic collection of events. And the person that should've gone out of the whole story changed doesn't have any explanation on HOW they changed in the movie. They just do. It shows a world that looks fascinating, and that should leave me awestruck, but it falls short of that on me, because it has no narrative hook.\\n\\nDue to that the character development holds no value, because there is no ultimate reason for Chihiro's travel from Point A to Point B, and when I finish the movie, due to the fact there wasn't really a strong story, I leave with absolutely nothing. While I wish everything I watched would at least come half as close as to how good the average Ghibli movie looks, that does not really improve the experience I've had with anything I watched by a huge margin. I see movies as means to tell a story, not as a means of an artistic expression. I don't hold it in the same value as a painting, because a movie is not just a painting. It has a lot of other elements. But I do want them to ultimately serve the purpose of delivering a clearcut story. And Spirited Away doesn't really present a story. It presents a collection of stringed together events that don't really have a point.\\n\\nSome people will think that I'm just missing the point and that I don't understand the fact that movie is supposed to represent the imaginative mind of a child and represent an adventure that only a child could envision. It does not pursue realism because it just isn't meant to be realistic. That is not what I'm criticizing it for. I'm criticizing it for being lazy and not taking proper time to develop its characters properly, and merely making them do stuff, without regard of representing at least some degree of their inner thoughts, to show how they have changed. That's what they lost me on. Not the thing that most people praise Ghibli for, and are seeking movies from this studio for. But the thing that the people that enjoy Ghibli for simply overlook, and that is the narrative structure. \\n\\nAnd Spirited Away is a narrative mess.\\n\\n• Who I would recommend Spirited Away to and who I would tell to avoid the series.\\n\\nSpirited Away is a good choice for you if you're looking for a movie that develops an adventure that only a child's mind could conjure up, that is quite strongly represented artistically and that is rich events that are meant to keep you hooked for the entire duration of the movie. I think it would be a bad choice for people that especially value the story, as Spirited Away doesn't really try to tell anything significant or focus on portraying the perspective of the characters they want to develop of what they're experiencing. It is also a bad choice if you don't want a character to suddenly  change personality just to better fit the events the movie wants to show on screen. But note that these shouldn't be too detrimental if you're just gonna experience Spirited Away for its artistic value, as it nails the portrayal of the world it is going for.  Ultimately, if you value aesthetics a lot more than the story, I recommend this movie to you. This is what it will try to keep you engaged with and this is what most people praise it for.\",\n",
       " 'Well, usually i avoid reviewing movies because for me it\\'s hard to judge them because i\\'m more used with series but still, i felt i had to make a review to this piece of art.. Let\\'s get to it .. Sen to Chihiro no Makikakushi or spirited away is a movie that came out in 2001 and had a huge success, it had so many that it streamed outside of japan, in many different countries and translated to many different languages.. when i first watched this movie i had 10 years old and i didn´t realize the beauty of it.. now 7 years later idecided to review this movie again, and for my surprise, as soon as i started watching it, I started remembering everything .. what does it means? That in fact, when i watched for the first time, i actually enjoyed a lot for remember it so well 7 years later just by looking at the characters. \\n\\nThis anime won the oscar price for best animation in 2003, yeah pretty cool hein? \\n\\nStory: 9/10. One word to describe it: Magical.. it drags us into that magical world where everything seems so .. magical ! It is fresh and really enjoyable actually. I mean this can be considered a kids movie, and it is but unlike disney movies, where everything seems so childish and ridiculous, here everything looks so nice.. i don´t know why honestly, maybe it is because of the tracks used ..  \\n\\nThe plot is interesting, creative, original, fluid, and for 120 min, has a nice pace and some twists. Even though being so great, the themes are not that different from the kids movies, which unfortunately makes it look more \"close to clichê\".. when we have such amazing plot and they don´t take advantage of it, it really makes me mad. \\n\\nPlus, certain characters in the movie i don´t know why they even appear ! There is a black monster over there that gets 20-30 mins screen time to be totally forgotten.. really felt like he was there to fill in.. and i really hate that ! \\n\\nArt: 9/10. It was made in 2001 so it doesn´t look really beautiful to our eyes but still .. the animation is the most fluid animation i\\'ve ever seen ! Everything looks so real in terms of movement that it felt like it was being filmed. Plus the detail on the background is stupid amazing. While in some TV shows and even some other movies, they play with shadows, vision camps and gradients to \"save\" some budget by cutting of completely the background (examples: using shadows of black/white they can hide some details, so usually dark places or bright full ones are used to do it; by putting the character in the first plan of vision, they can blur the background that it won´t look bad because we will have our eyes on the character), it\\'s techniques like these ones that manage to save some money... here ... THERE IS NOT ANYTHING LIKE THAT .. every single frame has details so deep as the colours of the pages of the books .. i mean that is just silly. The background is so full of so many things, that forces us to wonder it while the action is happening instead of focusing only the main vision plan .. it\\'s beyond amazing... \\n\\nSound: 10/10 .. please it makes everything look unreal .. and that is the purpose so they made it well.. it fits extremely well with the enviroment, which just creates a nice mood. And this is important actually, like the animation, the sound has the power to \"turn on\" the anime/movie by making it look better from what actually is .. both the animation and the sound have that effect, which is just great! \\n\\nCharacter: 7/10. Well i don´t know if it is because of being movie or whatever, but we only have this characters: Chihiro, her friends and her \"enemies\", if you see the movie you will understand the quotation marks on \"enemies\".. really disapointing.. However our main character saves the day, even though she does not have much development .. it\\'s a movie for god sake ! They don´t have time for deep monologues talking about her personal feelings.. her story is just amazing and can even teach us something .. the rewards of bravery, friendship and nobility. \\n\\nEnjoyment: Which such a nice plot, nice animation and nice tracks .. well i full enjoyed every single minute. I got sad when this movie ended .. i wanted more .. and this my friends, is the feeling that tells you if the movie/anime was good or not.. \\n\\nThe ending was just ... like everything else.. magical. I really can´t tell you more because i want zero spoil, i want you to full appreciate this movie like i did. \\n\\nOverall: 9/10 .. it has some flaws so it can´t be a 10/10 .. i would say 9.5/10 so .. you won´t have regrets about spending 5 minutes to give this movie a chance, after 5 minutes into the movie .. sayonara my friends .. i see you in the end of the movie :) \\n\\nI reccomend this anime to everyone. It\\'s a piece of art that everyone must try some day ..',\n",
       " \"Hayao Miyazaki is a genius and it really shines in this masterpiece. I've watched this movie countless times and it never gets old. It is still just as magical, intriguing and amazing as ever! Story: [10] The story begins with ten year old Chihiro and her family on their way to their new home and decide to take a short cut. In the beginning, you see little Chihiro as a bratty little girl who is too scared to do anything without her parents. Later in the story you see this character develop beautifully. She becomes a brave, enlightened little girl who looks forward to new adventures. Stumblingupon an abandoned theme park, her parents decide to help themselves to a meal laid out in a stand and are turned into pigs by the angry spirits! It is then that Chihiro receives a warning from Haku, a young boy, to leave before the lanterns set but is too late in doing so and ends up stumbling into a sea of water. Forced to work in the spirits bathhouse owned by the wicked Yu-baaba, Chihiro overcomes many challenges and meets new friends along the way. \\n\\nWho could Haku be? What does he have to do with her past? How is Chihiro going to save her parents and go home? Will she ever go home? \\n\\nA very unique, compelling story!\\n\\nArt: [10]\\nThe art is  breathtaking and absolutely incredible! It gives you a real feel for the characters and setting. \\n\\nSound: [10]\\nThe voices are crisp and fit the characters right down to a tee. \\n\\nCharacters: [10]\\nCharacter development and unique personas are present, overall. My favorite characters would have to be Haku, Kamajii and Chihiro. Haku seems like your typical guy, trapped to be Yu-baaba's servant and forced to fulfill her dirty deeds all the while seeming arrogant in public, but gentle towards Chihiro. Kamajii, the boiler man, and Chihiro, the young human girl, surprise you as the story progresses. Lin, No Face, Zeniiba and even Yu-baaba  become delightful characters.\\n\\nOverall: [10] \\nI give this anime a 10 out of 10. I really enjoyed watching it and actually feeling involved in the characters dilemmas. This is the type of anime that keeps you on the edge of your seat in suspense, but also keeps you craving more in the end. It WILL surprise you. ;] \\nThis could very well be one of Hayao Miyazaki's best works. To all of you Miyazaki fans out there: cheers!\",\n",
       " \"This movie was my first introduction to anime that didn't involve teenagers piloting giant robots, and I have to say, if I hadn't seen it, I would've written off all anime as only being fit for 12 year olds. &quot;Spirited Away&quot; is awesome, beautiful, and one of my favorite movies in any genre. Some might feel it's only for kids, or long for more gunplay, explosions, heroines with oversize chests and undersized clothes, etc. Well, that's fine, but they're missing out.\",\n",
       " 'Yes, I just gave this movie tens across the board. And this is not because of a temporary high after watching the movie. I am not going to wake up tomorrow and say \"wow, that really wasn\\'t that great. Why did I get so excited?\" because I watched this movie many years ago. In fact, this was my first, and to this day remains my favorite anime, movie, and story of all time. There are movies that you really have to think about. Movies that you won\\'t understand unless you think about them until your brains come out your ears, and most people, unless totallyintrigued, do not wish to think that much. Similarly, there are movies that are so plain in design that they require no thinking whatsoever. They lack in substance and exceed only in the predictable, feel-good story.\\n\\nHowever, I have found that the best movies, and screw movies, just stories in general, are most successful when they find a type of balance between these two polar, but perpendicular ideas. And Spirited Away does.\\n\\nSpirited Away has everything we love about predictable movies: relatable characters, character development, unbelievable setting, adventure, and sincere messages. But it also has the quirkiness that people find interesting and the artsy technicalities that experts of this field rave about.\\n\\nI can confidently say that when you watch Spirited Away, you are in for a ride. It will be a slightly bizarre experience perhaps, but this balance between the bizarre and the familiarity is exactly what makes Spirited Away a spectacular movie.\\n\\nSpirited Away chronicles a girl and her transition from child to young adult. Spirited Away is all about finding inner strength and qualities that you never knew you had, and while the protagonist Chihiro finds herself in the strangest and most frightening world you could imagine, I don\\'t feel that this world is very different from the one she came from. Perhaps enhanced, yes, but the challenges themselves are the same no matter what setting, and Miyazaki shows this in his enhanced atmosphere. Chihiro learns to rely on herself and her mind and her heart, blossoming into a passionate young lady, and while that idea is nothing new, you will be surprised as to how new and important these ideas will seem when you watch the film.\\n\\nFrom my own experience, I can say that Spirited Away effected me particularly strongly. It was not difficult to relate the attitude of the character to my childlike self, and so it seemed to me that her story was similar to my own (although perhaps subtracting the \"spiriting away\" aspect). I cannot know, if I watched it for the first time today, that I would feel as attached to it as I did when I was eleven years old and had never watched an anime before. But I have a feeling that Spirited Away would still have found a special place in my heart. \\n\\nI can restate the obvious about the artistic and auditory acclaim of this movie, but I feel it would be redundant to do so when so many have done it before me. If it were up to me, I would talk about the contents of this movie indefinitely, particularly the complexities of Ogino Chihiro, but I feel that that is inadvisable as well, so I\\'ll stop now.\\n\\nI hope you give Spirited Away a try and admire the qualities I described above. Happy watching!',\n",
       " 'Overview: The mopey Chihiro is throwing a small tantrum in her parents` car as they`re on their way to their new home. Understandably for a young child, she hates the idea of leaving her friends and adjusting to a new environment. Little does she know just how different her next environment would be when an ill-conceived shortcut leads the family to a mysterious bath house for the spirits. Her parents transform into pigs, and it`s up to Chihiro to make do on her own while she finds a way to undo the spell. Story & Characters Spirited Away is a window into Miyazaki`s imagination. Chihiro`s journey takes usat first to the Japanese-lore inspired bathhouse, ruled by (oddly enough) a western looking witch, and eventually to a place reminiscent of a European country side, with walking lamps, bouncing heads, and plenty of other wacky creatures in between. This is far from a trippy, scene-to-scene spectacle though. The story is grounded by and centered around the unlikely perseverance of Chihiro, who seems at first overly dependent, panicky and clumsy.\\n\\nReminiscent of Alice in Wonderland, the fantasy world that appears as if it could not be further from reality actually has numerous parallels to our own lives. There is room to pick each bit of symbolism apart, but the beauty of this film is that such a cerebral understanding isn`t necessary to really get this film. The transition between the awe that the magical world inspires at first to the familiarity we feel for it towards the end is so seamless that it is only after the film is finished that the metaphors for humans and human society become apparent.\\n\\nAt the end of the day, Spirited Away will very much be a recognizably Miyazaki film with a little environmentalism, and plenty of the sweet innocence of youth. It starts off though, on a bit of a heartbreaking note. Chihiro goes through bouts of despair for losing her parents and as painful as it is to see her sink, it is equally inspiring to see her pick herself up again and continue clumsily at whatever task was occupying her. Unlike most of Miyazaki`s female leads who tend to be beautiful, pretty, or cute (depending on the age group), Chihiro`s chubby cheeks and messy hair make her unmistakably plain. Neither is her personality bouncy as is the case with the vast majority of girls in animation. Other than her listlessness, there isn`t much to describe about her. It is her unremarkable nature that makes her so adorable as the film develops the earnestness in her character that is deeper, and more essential than her personality. Where the earnestness makes her admirable, the plainness makes her genuine, and lovable. We might laugh at her expressions when she touches something vile, or an instance of complete physical ineptitude, but in an affectionate way, not unlike how you might laugh at your niece for tripping over herself.\\n\\nVisuals\\nMost critics acclaim Miyazaki for the whimsy in his animation, but equally remarkable is the detail that conveys humanity. Chihiro physically expresses herself in more ways than most animated characters. To start, her repertoire of facial expressions is more compete than most, but more importantly, it`s the conscious effort made to put both personality and realism in her movements. One example is when Chihiro must walk down a steep staircase along the side of a tall building. Instead of conveying her terror with a facial expression and ginger steps down the stairs, she gets on her butt and essentially crawls down the steps feet first, treating each rung like a near death experience. It takes some creativity to think up such an extreme, yet human manifestation of fear. The animation shows a layer of humanity that dialogue can`t approach. Regarding the backgrounds and overall visual theme, it is gorgeous and also quite expansive. There are images of luscious greenery, bright and extravagant decor in the bath house, and the serene, pastel-y colors of the countryside.\\n\\nSound\\nPiano and string centric pieces go nicely with the downbeat scenes in the film. The antics are accompanied by bright, stop-and-go pieces and the more dramatic scenes get the full orchestral treatment. It works well, but is largely unremarkable. The voice acting is wonderful on both tracks. The English voice actors capture the same essence in the characters as their Japanese counterparts with the exception of Chihiro. Chihiro`s Japanese performance makes her sound older than her age, but fittingly in the dumps, while her English voice is brighter, faster, but more believably childish.\\n\\n--\\n\\nSpirited Away spans moods, settings and emotions in a way that no other Ghibli film does. More so than even Princess Mononoke, this film is epic. This time, it manages to balance the typical innocence associated with the studio to create something that is intelligent, but also tugs at the heart strings in the most primal way.',\n",
       " 'Considered one of the (if not THE) best Anime movies of all time, let\\'s see how good it really is (in my eyes only of course). Story: The plot of Spirited Away bears a strong similarity to Alice in Wonderland. Both feature young girls stranding in a bizarre fantasy world, struggling to get back home. There are a lot of strange creatures and magic happening. For somebody from the west, some of these things may appear even weirder, but since we are in a fairy tale, that shouldn\\'t bother you. Instead of going forward, this movie takes a couple of turns that may make it hard tofollow for the very young viewers, but in general I can say that this is an entertaining ride.\\n7/10\\n\\nArt:\\nI gotta be honest, Ghibli art is not my thing. That doesn\\'t mean it\\'s bad, not at all. Everything works well in the fantasy world, it gives all those creatures unique features and the weirdness that they are supposed to represent. I didn\\'t really get into the humans though. Chihiros facial expressions were really weird at times, not giving the vibe of \"normalness\" that should probably be there to contrast the magical world she is thrown into.\\n7/10\\n\\nSound:\\nSpirited Away does not feature much of a soundtrack, at least not noticeable. The music felt like it was trying to be on Disney level, but it didn\\'t really work that way. The voice actors did a good job and gave their respective characters a little more depth.\\n6/10\\n\\nCharacters:\\nThankfully the number of important characters is not as big as in, say, Akira. Still it felt like some could have gotten a a little more scenes. Rin for example was an interesting character that had less screentime than I would have liked. But I can\\'t say anything bad about the characters themselves, all feel well designed and fulfill their function. Most are likeable, while Yubaba is a classic evil witch type of character.\\n7/10\\n\\nEnjoyment:\\nI seem to have not enjoyed the movie as much as most other people. That doesn\\'t mean I didn\\'t like it, but it will never make it in my favourite movie collection. Maybe it\\'s because I\\'m not the target audience and can\\'t relate to Chihiros quest much. It is a good movie, a great movie for children. It\\'s just not my cup of tea in the long run. I did not regret seeing it though, but so many people have praised Spirited Away that I felt nitpicking was more appropriate for this review.\\n6/10\\n\\nOverall:\\n6.6/10\\n\\nI have to go now, I can see some torches and pitchforks outside my window.',\n",
       " 'I know the movie’s main target audience are the kids as Miyazaki himself states (10 year old girls according to him. Weirdly specific), but, that’s almost always the case with Miyazaki, so I was expecting something more well-written. The story is all over the place and doesn’t make a lot of sense. There are a lot of stereotypical tropes and I don’t think he gives them a new spin at all. The world is vibrant and the usage of imagery against the backdrop of Japanese mythology and folklore is great, and the fluidity of the animation and the attention to detail is astounding; however, I don’tthink they are enough to ignore the lackluster storytelling and consider this a satisfactory movie. Movies, in the end, are narrative forms and even if one creates a more sensual experience that relies on abstract concepts to make it more avant-garde, it should be coherent with the general structure of the narrative as a whole. Miyazaki doesn’t try to make an experimental arthouse, the story of the film follow a very traditional narrative model, and when you make your assessment within this perspective, the underwhelming presence of the story turns this movie to a big disappointment for me. \\n\\nThe world of Spirited Away is definitely rich and one can easily write a few distinct dissertations about the symbolism and subtle social commentary; nevertheless, this richness of content doesn’t necessarily make this movie an enjoyable or impressive narrative. In fact, it was one of the worst Studio Ghibli movies I’ve ever watched. Totoro, which I have been expecting to be very childish with its premise, felt like a much more grounded story with its minimalist and well planned plot structure.',\n",

       " 'Have you ever wondered what it would feel like to be suddenly whisked away into a world completely different from your own? A world wherein a variety of magic and fantasy awaits you around every corner. Well, I haven’t given a single thought about such things ever since I watched the 2002 Studio Ghibli film, “Spirited Away”. It was directed by Hayao Miyazaki (known for his other works, Howl’s Moving Castle & Ponyo). When I heard that this was an Academy award-winning film, I couldn’t expect anything less. A lot of people were also raving about how good it was and it has the potential ofbecoming a classic animated feature. I got curious as to how a movie about a girl being whisked away to a spirit world was really that great. I didn’t know what the big deal was, so it took me several months before I actually got convinced to watch this. I spent that time to read some reviews and watch the trailer. When I’ve finally gotten the gumption to see the movie for myself, it somehow exceeded my expectations.\\n\\nThe story starts off with a girl on a road trip with her parents. The girl’s name is Chihiro. Upon finding out that they were lost in the middle of nowhere, she and her parents managed to go through a tunnel that unexpectedly lead them towards an uncanny and mysterious place. Unbeknownst to the spirits lurking around the town, her parents ate the food that was set before them without any hesitation. Little did they know that the food turned them into large and meaty pigs. In order to go back to their world, Chihiro must embark on a journey with her newly-found courage and friendships.\\n\\nMatched by a lighthearted feel and mood, “Spirited Away” actually has a deep message when you watch the scenes carefully. I couldn’t point out everything because it takes me a very long time before I could take in and digest what the movie really has to offer. Behind all the magnificent and impeccable animation is a message deep enough to touch the hearts of different people. I couldn’t find the words express how much this film touched me in many ways. The beautiful combination of the art, animation, characters, and music morphed into such a wonderful animated feature. One thing that kind of ticked me off was the parents of Chihiro, though. They seemed kind of childish to actually eat something right off the bat without being wary of their surroundings. It’s a very small and minor thing, but still, I can’t ignore the details.\\n\\nTo sum up everything in a nutshell, I found myself at loss for words. One thing that I would take home from this film would be the fact that sometimes, we get too caught up with things that don’t really matter. In the end, we fall prey to our own fantasies to the point that we start to get blind from reality – the kind of reality wherein we don’t seem to recognize the people or things that are important to us (as shown in the film several times). All I can say is, “Spirited Away” is one of the best animated features I’ve seen.',\n",
       " \"Having seen this film a handful of times, I have always been impressed by and admired how technically accomplished it is. Yet after having just watched it again for perhaps the fifth or sixth time, I now feel that the themes and the character development take a back seat to those technical accomplishments. Undoubtedly they are present, but in my opinion one must do some reaching and stretching. As a result of all this, it is hard for me to care about the characters and the story being told. To me, this is one of Studio Ghibli's weaker films. It is an imaginative, well-paced film,though, for aforementioned reasons, I would start elsewhere in the Ghibli filmography. Then again, this could very well be the one Japanese animation that is most accessible for American audiences. Who knows...\",\n",
       " 'A mysterious, beautiful epic from Miyazaki. The story is, at first, nothing out of the ordinary, for a fantasy. A young girl - Chihiro, along with her parents, gets lost on their way to their new home, and find what they believe to be an abandoned theme park, which turns out to be a fantasy world. When her parents get turned into pigs because of their actions, it\\'s up to Chihiro to find a way in this new bizarre world to change them back, with the help of Haku - a young magician. And I\\'m not going to say anymore for fear of spoiling this wonderoustale for you.\\nBut I can bet you will be sitting, at the end, wondering \"Wait, What?\"\\nIt does leave many parts uncovered and undeveloped, and leaves you wanting and wondering about more. But, in true Miyazaki fashion, you will be daydreaming for the rest of your life of alternate endings, or more developments, or simply more depth into a certain character.\\n\\nThe music was the main event for me. Look out for the strings/piano combination of \\'The Sixth Station\\', some of the most beautiful music ever composed by the glorious Joe Hisaishi. The beauty of the music almost surpasses the beauty of the film, and that is saying something considering how wonderous the movie is.\\n\\nThe art is just... splendid. I think the artists themselves drawing and animating this film must have had a lot of fun with it, for it shows in every minute detail. (Look out for the scene in Boh\\'s room or Yubaba\\'s lair, both beautiful in detail and stunning throughout). \\n\\nAll in all, it\\'s a film I think everyone should watch by their teens. One of the most beautiful, quizzical, mysterious, and will-leave-you-guessing anime films, it\\'s also one of the greatest.',\n",
       " 'Spirited away is a story of changes, of a way, of a road to follow and it does it\\'s work splendidly. The presence that it holds over the medium is large but the most beautiful part of this experience is that it lives up to it\\'s figure and legacy. The story is simple but masterfully managed, it revolves around Chihiro, Ogino a naive, spoiled and stubborn 10-year-old girl that is traveling with her parents and discovers an abandoned amusement park on the way to their new house, she is less than pleased when her parents stop by to visit the area, venturing inside she realizes thatthere is more to this place than what can be seen as strange things happen once dusk falls. Things start to change when goshtly apparitions and food that turns her parents into pigs occurs and those events are just the start of a journey that will take her to things she had never experienced before. Chihiro unwittingly crossed into the spirit world.\\n\\nThe art of this show is amazing in the literal sense of the word, the ghost have a design that can be found in our dreams and every character has a design that just shows how beautiful is the spirit world.

Yubaba is a grumpy old lady and Zeniba behaves like a lovely grandma would do.\\n\\nThis series is an enjoyable experience that is considered a classic for a reason, it does a lot of things well and is an all-around masterful work of animation and one of the reasons as to why i love this medium so much.',\n",
       " 'Art = 9 - The animation is very colorful, it makes you \"feel\" that you are living in a \"real\" fantasy world. - The graphic is not as generic as an every day anime you watched on TV, but it\\'s quite beautiful, and it can capture the graphic detail of the environment, let say \"a crack in the stone\", \"a moss in the stone\", etc. all can be watched in a clear detail so that we notice the \"crack\" and the \"stone\", the \"moss\" and the \"stone\". - But the character\\'s graphic is rather old fashioned and not like the generic modern anime you watch on TV. - That\\'swhy in Art department, I don\\'t give a perfect 10, but 9 instead.\\n\\nStory = 10\\nCharacter = 9\\n- The story is wonderful, Hayao Miyazaki succeeds in sewing a simple story with a simple plot, but can draw the audience\\'s emotion to feel exactly like the story goes.\\n- For example, (A Little Bit Spoiler) ......................... Spirited Away wants to show the warmth of a motherly love from one character to several others in Spirited Away, then they show it through Zeniba\\'s compassion through a gift to the other character, or even invite a character to stay and live with her, or encourage another character to help others through a simple errand.\\n- Just from one example, we could all understand the message of endearment and makes us want to say \"awww, that is so sweet\".\\n- And from start from the end of the story, Spirited Away is filled and full of act that we could make us say different kind of emotions.\\n- Not just endearment, but also a story of doing the extra effort for the people you love, and the kind hearted Chihiro that will do a helpful deed even to the one that she barely know close.\\n- It is the \"will do anything for love\" and do the helpful deed to others that could move our emotions, not only to say \"awww, that is so sweet\", but also a lot of positive moral value that not only we could learn from it, but also makes us to fall in love with many of the characters, because many of them, both the main and supporting cast have a lot of good natured and kind hearted spirit that we appreciate and love.\\n- Even the main antagonist (villain) is also lovable, because the main villain the the typical witch you always watch on TV and movies, fussy, cranky, cunning, but a mother at heart.\\n- Even so, you still fall in love with that witch, because that is what a witch should be, fussy, cranky, cunning, it\\'s annoying but endearing at the same time.\\n- More on the characters department, I noticed that ALL of the cast, ranging from the main even to the supporting characters, ALL of them have a very significant role, and not just a \"just-passing-by\" characters that we could just forget them, because we can\\'t. Because ALL of them has significant role to built the entire puzzle of the story.\\n- Example for my explanation above is the example of the character No Face (A Little Bit Spoiler) ................ No Face is a supporting cast, but without him, Chihiro would never got the bath token to bathe another supporting cast, and therefore could not ever obtain the green ball of medicine to cure another cast in the movie.\\n- That\\'s why we can not take it for granted any of the characters. ALL of them make the puzzle to be complete.\\n- And that\\'s just making the story department a stronger value, because the story is built through all of the characters significant role, which is not an easy task for the writer and director to do, but causing it a very valuable movie.\\n- There are lots of endearment act that we could say \"awww, that is so sweet\".\\n- There are lots of another act like with such movement that we could drop our tears.\\n- There are lot of kind hearted and good natured gesture that many of the characters shows that makes we to fall in love with many of the characters, and learn the \"moral of the story\".\\n- That\\'s why on the story department, the score can reach as high as the perfect 10.\\n- However, for the character department, the character Haku seems to cold, stiff, and flat in emotion, which is why, even though the other main and supporting characters are very loveable, the score drops one notch from the perfect 10 into a \"9\".\\n\\nSound = 10\\n- The sound is wonderful, it has a lot of soundtracks and themes for many of the scenes and act.\\n- Which is why in the sound department, it is filled with rich and a lot of soundtracks.\\n- And what\\'s more, the soundtracks are as moving emotionally as the scene it self, which makes you -again- be drawn to the emotion of the scene and act.\\n- A perfect 10 for the Sound department.\\n\\nEnjoyment = 10\\n- The explanation basically the same in Art and Story.\\n- But the additional explanation is, the story is so light that you don\\'t have to think seriously for the plot. Just sit down and enjoy the show.\\n- Is it enjoyable? Of course, It is about an adventure in a fantasy world, but not just a fantasy world, but a colorful fantasy world, the color is bright and cheerful either, makes you feel that you live in a cheerful, bright and \"happy\" atmosphere world.\\n- And you will love the characters as explained before, they are all have traits of kind hearted and good natured, and even the villain is likeable, because the villain has done a good job in portraying her self as this fussy, cranky, and cunning evil witch.\\n- All the characters are making a significant role to built the entire puzzle of the story, which makes you want to watch \"what happen next after............\".\\n- You will find a lot of moving emotionally act and scene that could make you \"feel\" the emotion of the movie just like the writer and director wants you to feel. Kinda like Disney movies, in this \"emotionally drawn to the movie\" department.\\n- After all of my explanations above, therefore this movie is not have a lot of enjoyment, but because it has a LOT of enjoyments to offer, this movie has a lot of replaying value. I even watch it over and over again in my DVD.\\n- So, enjoyment = perfect 10.\\n\\nSo, my conclusion for all of my explanations above, this movie deserve a perfect 10.',\n",
       " 'When I first watched Sprited Away as a child I had no clue of what kind of masterpiece it is. I watched it again and I now consider it as a Classic – this meaning it as a lasting significance. Considering it is often listed amongst the likes of the best movies of all time, most consider this the masterpiece of Miyazaki. Miyazaki has the ability to create works that are both emotionally touching and visually stunning, and this certainly is no exception. The plot is about the 10-year-old Chihiro that gets trapped in the land of spirits. A boy named Haku helps her toembark on a journey to return home. The film is filled with scenes of inaction, a scene without any action. In an interview with Roger Ebert, Miyazaki explained the usefulness of the little extra scenes called ‘ma’. These are the scenes of inaction, where a character might glance off into the distance or sit quietly. \\n\\nThese scenes are a common occurrence in his films. The usefulness of these scenes are, according to Miyazaki; ‘If you just have non-stop action with no breathing space at all,, it is just busyness. But if you take a moment, then the tension building in the film can grow into a wider dimension. If you just have tension at 80 degrees all the time, you just get numb.’\\n\\nThe animation of this movie is also great because of the small details that Miyazaki paid close attention to. Small additions like the dirt on the bottoms of feet, chopsticks falling over when bumped, or a zipper catching the sunlight to contribute to the overall feel of the film. Outside this the art of the characters and environment is appealing to the eye.\\n\\nAlso the attention put to details is a useful tool for developing characters. Chihiro is supposed to be a typical ten-year-old, so she behaves as such. When she puts on her shoes, she does so with extra care and taps the toe of each shoe to make sure they fit properly. In another scene, the girl’s parents call for her, but she doesn’t answer until the second time.\\n\\nAll these things add up to make this movie the master piece it is, and why I regard this movie as a true Classic. I fear that I can write half a novella about all the great points that Miyazaki made in this movie, so I can only say that is a great movie to watch. It is not packed with action or drama, but the message it conveys is no less important. Spirited Away will always have a special place in the history of anime.',\n",
       " 'I feel that Chihiro is a very real person, because it always seems like every character in an Anime I see has a wonderful personality. Well, in terms of character traits, this movie is very realistic and shows aspects of young girls not seen in other Anime/Movies. However, because I am not completely familiar with the Japanese culture, I sometimes felt out of place because some things that would have probably made sense to a Japanese person did not make sense to me. Aside from that, the animation was smooth, the music was astounding and greatly contributed to the film, and the character development was justphenomenal. I enjoyed this movie very much and I highly recommend it.',\n",
       " '\"Spirited Away\" is an excellent Rorschach test to determine what a viewer values most in a picture. On the one hand, this is an absolutely gorgeous film, full of amazing, inspired animation. From the bizarre yokai to the sumptuous bathhouse to shots of the forest and blue sky, this is a memorable, utterly beautiful film. Although even here, my brain reminded me that certain visual motifs from the only two other Miyazaki films I\\'ve seen, \"Castle of Cagliostro\" and \"Princess Monoke\", were reused. Still, one can\\'t say enough good things about the ingenuity and majesty of the animation. The music, a wistful, classic score inspiredby old-school Disney, is good if neither great nor particularly original. Surely, a young child will love this. But personally, I don\\'t love it now, and would have loved it even less when it came out, when I was in my early teens. \\n\\nWhy? Because narratively, the movie is a mess. On every level. There is the plot hole that Haku tells Chihiro to persistently beg for a job from Kamaji and not be tricked into leaving and certainly to avoid seeing Yubaba. Instead, Chihiro IS talked into leaving Kamaji to see Yubaba, who she successfully begs for a job from. Chihiro foolishly disobeys and does the exact opposite of what she\\'s told, and this is never brought up again.\\n\\nStructurally, there are a bunch of magic MacGuffins that randomly appear as the plot needs them to, with no established rules or explanation, then are randomly used as the plot requires them to be. There is no rhyme or reason, but it always works out for the protagonist, and hopefully the animation and music distract you from thinking too hard about it. \\n\\nOne could partially overlook both of these, except that Miyazaki wrote a fairy tale while utterly failing to understand what gave them their power. Namely, a strong moral message. Perhaps a grim and tragic one, like Hans Christian Anderson\\'s \"The Little Mermaid\", but a clear, heartfelt idea of what constituted right and wrong, and how transgressors were punished and the virtuous rewarded.  \\n\\nThere is none of this in \"Spirited Away\". Yubaba turns humans into pigs and devours their souls, isn\\'t punished for it, and will presumably continue to do so by the movie\\'s end. Chihiro learned what, exactly? Not to eat meat? To be brave? \\n\\nNevermind that the whole affair is painfully drawn-out. In the interests of showing every bit of awe-inspiring animation, the story slogs and drags at times, with a shockingly limited number of scenes for a 2 hour picture.  \\n\\nThis movie is like the gold spouted by No-Face; magnificent on the outside, and mud on the inside. \\n\\nWhile this is by no means a bad film, especially for very young kids, I was ultimately underwhelmed at its conclusion. THIS is the movie so heavily praised as a masterpiece among masterpieces? By adults? To begin with, there are other visually stunning anime movies paired with actual great stories, like all of Satoshi Kon\\'s works or \"Vampire Hunter D: Bloodust\". Hell, there are even more visually interesting, unique, and weird animations, like \"Cat Soup\". But those lack the hype of \"Studio Ghibli\" and its sublime genius, Hayao Miyazaki.',\n",
       " \"I'll make this short and simple for those skimmers. i got bored of it in a few minutes, but waited till the end for something interesting to happen, and it only got worse and worse. The storyline was boring, and hard to follow (or remember). The art was okay, graphics were bit bad. Sound was pretty good with cool chords and whatnot, but didn't add much. The characters were boring. I mean one is a girl, the other is her parents, the other is a witch, and then there's a boy and a dragon. yes it may sound exciting, but all that really happens is her parentsturn into pigs and she has to save them.\\nI didn't really enjoy this movie at all, and i seriously don't remember most of it.\\nOverall it left no lasting impression on me and a month later i couldn't remember anything of what it was about. (today is that month later)\",\n",
       " 'Oh man, I love Spirited Away. Hayao Miyazaki\\'s groundbreaking anime phenomenon stills holds up as my favorite animated film in the world right now, cause come on? It\\'s Hayao Miyazaki and he knows how to create engaging worlds. It\\'s such an imaginative and engaging story, that James Cameron\\'s describes both Spirited Away and Osamu Tezuka\\'s Metropolis, both films that are full of \"Beauty, Power, Mystery and above all, Heart\". Spirited Away is about Chihiro Ogino, a 10 year old girl who move into a new town with her parents, only to discover that they get lost and later, they found an abandoned amusement park and Chihiro\\'sdad insists them to explore the park. However, a boy name Haku warns Chihiro that this park is forbidden and that she must leave the place before nightfall. Chihiro finds her parents, only to find them transformed into pigs and the entire park gets full of black spirits on nightfall. Now Chihiro works for a creepy old lady, Yubaba, as a servant, changes her name from Chihiro to Sen and if she forgets her real name, she would be trapped in the spirit world forever, Now Chihiro must find a way to save her parents and escape the spirit world, as she learns to accept her life through adulthood on her own. The story is just fantastic and really engaging, as we see a young girl trying to face the toughest situations on her own and believing in herself on what she can do to help the people she loves. Also, there are a lot of touching moments in Spirited Away, my favorite has to be the one where Chihiro sits with a black spirit \"No Face\" in the train station, as the music plays peacefully in the background.\\n\\nSpirited Away looks STUNNIG!!!!! The animation made by Studio Ghibli is still the best looking anime, out of all the Miyazaki movies out there (except Mononoke, that\\'s impossible to top). The Japanese culture style of the film really fits into this strange spiritual fantasy film, full of strange but fascinating creatures, spirits and those cute black furballs that appear are also strange but cute. Character designs are very fluid and they really act like actual human beings, like it really brings strong emotions to the character\\'s as they progress through the story on saving Chihiro\\'s parents. Voice acting is fantastic, but the dubbing is perfect, thanks to the wonderful support of Pixar and John Lasseter. Lasseter and Pixar have great respect to the anime industry and to Hayao Miyazaki, cause John loves the works of Studio Ghibli and never make dumb changes to the film so that it\\'s stays true to the work of the director and the English cast that John assembled is fantastic. All the actors voicing the characers were great, including Daveigh Chase, Tara Strong, Jason Mardsen, Suzanne Pleshette, David Ognen Steirs and so on.\\n\\nSpirited Away is just a groundbreaking masterpiece by Hayao Miyazaki. If I were you, I would see it again, rather than describing how spectacular the film is and why anime has the balls to bring true originality than most of the garbage Hollywood brings nowadays. Spirited Away is a must-own film for any anime fan out there wanting to experience this great film on their TV\\'s.']"
