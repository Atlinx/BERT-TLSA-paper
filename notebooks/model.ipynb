       " 'original_text': [\"I first watched Ouran when I was a full fledged middle school weeb, completely unaware that the characters were being played up for their tropes. Now that I have graduated high school I still enjoy this anime for not only the nostalgia it gives as a staple of the 2000s, but also for the emotional bond one will form with each of the characters. They may all be blissfully trope-y, but don't let that put you off; this anime is NOT a parody, it is a homage which builds the characters from the ground up. Ouran is equal parts hilarious, sad, heartwarming and will have yourouting for each of the characters in their pursuit for love. If you have a soft spot for unapologetically 2000s romcom shojo anime then Ouran should definitely be on your watchlist.\",\n",
       "  'I was down with the flu and I was curled up in my room, looking for something cozy to watch. Flipping through my collection, I suddenly remembered the My Neighbor Totoro DVD I had received as a gift a while back. Needless to say, I popped it into my player, sat back and had one of the most relaxing and peaceful 90 minutes of my life. My Neighbor Totoro is hard to synopsize because of the tranquil and laid back first half. I suppose it would suffice to say that this classic 1988 Studio Ghibli movie is about the innocent fun of two little sisters whomove into a house in a village, along with their father, only to find out that the picturesque place can be more mysterious than they thought. My Neighbor Totoro has bagged several awards over the years and helped bring Japanese animation into the global spotlight.\\n\\nThe basic driving force behind the story is this: Don’t you want to be a kid again? Don’t you want to go back to the days when your only responsibilities were to show up at school and be home on time? Don’t you want to look forward to each day, because there was always something new to learn, find and discover? This universal, yet eternally successful theme is what made My Neighbor Totoro click. The story is so beautifully crafted that kids look at this movie as the adventures of two sisters, while adults while adults perceive this anime to be a timeless classic that will forever remind them of their innocent childhood.\\n\\nAnother positive aspect of the story is that it’s character driven, but not in the traditional sense. Instead of developing the characters or making them take on hard decisions, this movie’s characters are the diamonds in the rough because of their simple and lifelike charms. They think, act and behave just like any curious and energetic children of their age would. The two sisters, Satsuki and Mei, are sure to inspire kids and bowl over adults with their sweet and loveable attitudes. The seiyu also deserve a lot of credit here, because they bring out all the energy and emotions necessary for their roles.\\n\\n If you were wondering why I didn’t make a mention of Totoro, the giant chubby ferret/forest spirit, it’s because he is (in my opinion at least) present for appealing to the kids and doesn’t really play an important role otherwise. A contributor to the entertainment (and cuteness, if you like) factor.\\n\\nI got my hands on a re-mastered DVD edition of this one, so I won’t be able to judge the quality of the original theatrical/VHS version. Still, you can’t make a good sculpture without good clay, so I think it’s safe to say that the art was outstanding. The backgrounds were very neat and looked exactly like a 1950s Japanese village. Characters were drawn in trademark Ghibli style, which is never a bad thing. A perfect ten.\\n\\nThe soundtrack added to the straightforward atmosphere of the show. Nothing fancy, just the good old piano. The OP, Stroll, was a nice upbeat song that reminded me of The Sound of Music, especially the English version.\\n\\nThis anime would get a sure ten from any kid who’s below 10, but looking at it from a more mature perspective, My Neighbor Totoro does have some minor issues which deny it the perfect score. Because of its age, it is rather predictable and I felt the mood swing from the lax and serene atmosphere from the first half to the more fast paced and fantastical approach to the second half was a little unnecessary. The fantasy aspect is played around with to please kids, but older viewers might not approve. The dialogue and script could’ve been a tad tighter too. But that’s about all the flaws I can come up with, after a lot of time I spent on nitpicking.\\n\\nRegardless of whether you’re a kid, adult, otaku, casual viewer or just plain bored, My Neighbor Totoro is most certainly worth your time. \\n\\n[  THE WRAP-UP ]\\nMy Neighbor Totoro is a landmark anime that garnered critical appeal and international fandom. Although primarily intended for children, this 90 minute movie is bound to appeal to the taste buds of anyone, even if they’re not a big fan of anime. The story is uncomplicated and easy to watch, which is always a good thing if you’re looking for something nice and comfy. The undeniable charm of the characters also adds to the realistic atmosphere of this Studio Ghbili movie. Despite its release date, the animation is solid, just like the fitting soundtrack. My Neighbor Totoro is an anime that gained mainstreamed recognition and popularity for good reason. In other words, watch it.',\n",
       "  \"Naruto! Oh wow! This is the BEST anime I had ever seen! I ranked it #1 on my anime list actually. Naruto is very inspirational, full of good values and adventures that wil take each one of us in very thrilling fantasy. Because of this anime I became more and more like Naruto, friendly, brave and strong! I adore every statement of the characters, even if he/she is bad or good. This anime shows not only fantasy but also reality. It reveals every characters' sorrows and happy moments. I believe that this anime is NOT boring, you will eventually get closer to thetrue personality of each characters, you could feel hatred or be amaze of that certain character.\\n\\nStory: THE BEST. I rated it as an outstanding one. Every episodes lead to another closer look to the character. I know it got lot of fillers, but it doesn't really matter!! What matter is to understand the importance of the story not what you are seeing wrong on the series.\\n\\nArt: THE BEST.I rated it again as the best because of the well-made fighting scenes although there are a lot of troubles in the fighting sequences.\\n\\nSound: THE BEST. I really like the sound, the BGM and most especially the OP and ED songs! The BGM suits every scenes and every character, from the happiest to the saddest music.\\n\\nCharacter: THE BEST. Very well molded characters. Each revealing unique attitudes and emotions. Naruto series really shows that each one of us iare UNIQUE.\\n\\nEnjoyment: I really enjoy this anime! It makes me happy all day! \\n\\nAnd I rated this anime as a top-notched. Thanks Kishimoto,for making this anime full of adventure and thrill!\",\n",
       "  'Overall: 5/10 Horimiya came in as a rom-com I\\'ve never heard of, but being so highly praised by many I decided to give it a watch. And I can safely say after 13 episodes, that this rom-com is just like many others, despite all the claims of being genre-subverting and unique. Horimiya had great potential, I\\'ll give it that. But that could be explored with the story and characters were basically thrown out the window after 2-3 episodes, making it another run-of-the-mill rom-com. Story: 3/10 I didn\\'t read the Horimiya manga until around EP 8, because that was when I started thinking to myself: are we ever going toexplore the themes the synopsis laid out? The idea of not judging others by their appearance, the potential for further exploration of themes of depression, bullying, societal norms/pressure, etc. were never brought up to the degree I expected. A lot of these problems were resolved way too quickly to be anywhere close to realistic or appreciable. \\n\\nOn the topic of speed, the pacing for Horimiya is so fast that you don\\'t get the chance to truly connect with many of the characters. Likewise, a lot of themes and messages felt under-developed because of this.\\n\\nArt: 8/10\\nI must say the art and animation were very nicely done: all the characters are eye-candy but it\\'s not enough to mitigate the poor pacing and storytelling elements.\\n\\nSound: 8/10\\nThe OP and ED are both quite good, and the OST, while small, is also used effectively. VA is pretty good too, nothing to complain about there.\\n\\nCharacter: 4/10\\nIf there\\'s one thing the manga did somewhat decently, it was the development of side characters (although this also fell off a cliff after 40 chapters or so), specifically for Shu. Shu is basically non-existent as an actual character until like EP 9 or 10. I can\\'t even remember and that\\'s sad. 90% of the subplots for the side characters are rushed so quickly or just outright ignored, so they only end up taking time away from developing the main couple (which was also sorely needed). I will say a few moments were decent, namely the Yuki and Sakura episode.\\n\\nNow as for our main 2 characters, Hori and Miyamura, I gotta say their synergy is great. It\\'s fun seeing them do their couple things together. That being said, they are also quite underdeveloped. Miyamura, for one, overcomes his depression and experience of bullying way too quickly, especially when you consider how severe it was. I\\'m all for forgiveness when it\\'s earned, but this guy forgive that turquoise-haired kid way too quickly man, especially when you consider how he was willing to fight Sengoku and Toru over conversations related to Hori; I guess this reveals his primary character flaw of being overly selfless. And why is this a flaw? Because it\\'s never really explained or justified, and overly relied upon as a crutch for plot/storytelling instead of as an actual character trait he\\'s trying to overcome. The same can be said for the flaws held by every other character they \"try to overcome.\" It just feels more like a plot convenience instead of an actual theme or message the show claims to set out to tackle.\\n\\nEnjoyment: 5/10\\nAt the end of the day, I had a mediocre time watching Horimiya. It was alright. And that\\'s about it. Nothing about it in retrospect stood out to me as fascinating, but likewise, there was also nothing there that made me despite it or want to drop it ASAP. Just another small rom-com in a big pond.',\n",
       "  \"This is a spoiler-free review of Miyazaki Hayao's animated movie Mononoke Hime. I'll try to review this movie as professionally as I can with as much objectivity as possible. First of all, I'd like to say that this is my first review on Myanimelist so bear with me when it comes to the overall length and lack of depth as I have decided to leave out a summary and as many spoilers as possible. Princess Mononoke, or Mononoke Hime as it is known in Japanese, is the sixth of famous Hayao-Miyazaki-directed Studio Ghibli movies and also the first that is animated using CGI. Story: In terms of plot,Princess Mononoke is one of Miyazaki's strongest hits. The movie changes locations a lot and builds up a lot of tension and excitement for the viewer as the movie is gearing up for the big confrontation at the end of the movie. As this is also the first Miyazaki movie that's longer than 90 minutes, it gets enough time to build up and have a very satisfying finale without suffering from pacing issues. \\n\\nArt:\\nLike any other Studio Ghibli movie, the art and animation is absolutely astonishing. It is highly recommended that if you decide to watch this movie that you get to watch it in 1080p or on blu-ray because every frame in this movie is so full of details that it would be very unfortunate to miss out on that, like when Ashitaka is trying to traverse a river, he ties his clothes to his bow and between Yakul's horns to prevent them from getting wet. In addition to that, this movie uses CGI to enhance some of its scenes and it works wonderfully. Instead of using CGI lazily to finish up the work quickly in a more cost-efficient manner, it's quite evident that the animators cared about every single frame they animated because this movie has some of the best CGI-animated scenes you can find. The CG simply blends into the handdrawn backgrounds so well without looking jarring at all. At last, it should be noted that this, unlike the other Studio Ghibli movies, is not a family friendly movie. Some scenes get very gritty and the movie does not hold back when it comes to showing blood or gore when it's appropriate. \\n\\nSound:\\nThe voice acting is pretty solid and the voice actors were well-casted so no complaints here. And like every other Miyazaki directed movie, the score is incredible. Composed by Hisaishi Joe, some of the tracks are downright exhilarating, fitting into their respective scenes pretty well. \\n\\nCharacters:\\nDespite being the protagonist, Ashitaka is a relatively boring character who does not receive much development. He simply plays the role of the hero character and has by default always set his mind to be the hero. This means that he always makes the right decisions without thinking, as if he's just fulfilling his role as that type of character. Other than him, San, the wolf-princess and the mascot of this movie, has surprisingly little screentime and seems a bit downplayed in a way. She is without a doubt a very interesting character but the movie seems to lack some quiet moments where the viewer gets to learn more about how she is as a character. With that said, the characters in this movie do serve their purpose in this kind the story quite well. Despite the lack of development, these characters are still very likeable and interesting to watch. At last, I'd like to note that their character designs are really good and stand out in a positive way, especially San, for having this wild but still graceful look to her. \\n\\nEnjoyment:\\nAh, how Miyazaki never seizes to impress me. Princess Mononoke is an absolute gem and despite the hype that has been around this movie for the last decade, it's not difficult to understand why it's appreciated by so many people. Although the characters may come of a little bit disappointing due to their lack of development and San's lack of screen-time, they are still quite likeable and the story itself is more than enough to compensate for the few flaws the characters have. Furthermore, the animation is absolutely gorgeous and could even be considered a milestone for many aspiring animators and studios when it comes to making believable and convincing movement and blending 2D and 3D animation together.\\n\\nOverall rating: 09/10 and highly recommended.\",\n",
       "  'Jojo\\'s is a wild, bizarre, eccentric, extravagant and manly anime. The art is very well-done, very well animated and colorful throughout the show. It makes it beautiful but it can also show emphasis during a scene, like when the colors get inverted for example. The music is also pretty good, especially the opening during Part 1. The voice acting is pretty decent too (I\\'ve watched the english dub) and the actors are good at screaming when their characters are screaming, and they scream rather often. It doesn\\'t sound like they are just speaking loudly. The show loves exposition and obviousness, I can\\'t tell you enough. Literallyalmost everything that happens will be repeated. While I found it annoying af in other anime, it\\'s sort of ok and even funny here. The anime remains fast-paced anyway, so they just make sure you\\'re never lost on what\\'s happening, no biggie here. The battles are rather interesting and are filled with twists and strategies.\\n\\nThe first episode sucks ass, I\\'ll be honest. The second episode too, mostly. I know they are set-ups for bigger things but they were terrible. People shouldn\\'t have to tolerate something until it gets better. The characters have good designs but their personalities are weak. The struggles of Jonathan and Dio can be summed up as good gentleman vs evil gentleman and they are perhaps the most fleshed out characters of part 1.\\n\\nJonathan is a super good guy but first and foremost he\\'s a gentleman. But he\\'s not only nice, he\\'s also fierce, hard to topple and he will never give up. It\\'s better than triumphing simply because you are a goodie-goodie nice guy. Dio is pretty much a bully for no reason. He hates his dad so he wants to be rich and powerful and steal that status from Jonathan. Then he becomes a vampire and want to rule the world, for some reason. I think a good villain is important and that is rather weak villain. But I found him ok still, because his immense power and badassery is a good opponent to test out how resilient and fierce Jojo is.\\n\\nPart 2 is... kind of good but not really.The villains were pretty pathetic and uninteresting, except for Wamuu who had a certain sense of warrior honor. The \"good\" characters weren\\'t much more interesting either. Other than Stroheim, characters were rather lame and forgettable, although Stroheim was extremely redundant, I still liked him because I liked everything that came out of his mouth (especially with that accent). Joseph gets old fast, even if his strategies and unpredictability make good fights. I found it funny that an anime with a main character being able to predict what his opponents are going to say and do, was predictable in itself. I couldn\\'t tell how stuff was going to happen, but I could tell what was going to happen, I am not boasting, it is just really obvious that X character is going to win, or would draw out from the fight and have a rematch later, or that a character would lose because it was someone else who was meant to defeat that particular opponent.\\n\\nThe worst part of this anime is the plot holes and ass pulls. This is going into the spoiler territory so I will not mention anything, but it is just extremely jarring. Remember when I said the anime loves exposition and obviousness? How it is predictable? Can you imagine if something happened and it was badly or never explained? It pissed me off. Especially near the final episodes, where there is a bunch of of ass pulls and plot holes in a short lapse of about 10 minutes. One is even lamp-shaded. Let that sink in. I found that disappointing. Maybe I am thinking too hard about it and worrying too much about the story while *maybe* it\\'s the magnificience and manliness I should be focusing on, but I\\'ve read and been told it was flawless and a masterpiece, so my expectations were set as such. This is no masterpiece in my opinion. It shines in other aspects and is good entertainment, but it has room for improvement.',\n",
       "  'I cannot even fathom why people think this anime is even remotely watchable. Oh wait, yes I can. Throw in some symbolism and some vague concepts that take a few seconds to comprehend, and ta-da, according to almost everyone, you have a frigging masterpiece! Are you kidding me? This is literally what I see when I read positive reviews on this anime: \"this is the best anime EVA (hur see what I did der), omg if u dont like it 5deep6u, yoiu just no understand the symbolism and the magic dat is the evangelion omg\" I understood the symbolism. I understood the ending. I am very sure that I amnot the only one that understood it and absolutely hated it.\\n\\nOh wow, it had some symbolism? Oh wow, you had to think? It must be a masterpiece! AHAHAHAH NO.\\n\\nThis feels exactly like the positive reviews of school days: Oh wow it made you feel emotion? HOW UTTERLY FANTASTIC.\\n\\nSure, it had symbolism. Sure, you had to connect concepts. Does that change the fact that it was boring as hell to watch? Does that change the fact that the story sucked? Does that change the fact that we had to sit through the same finding-yourself-through-psychotic-mumbling over and over again? Does it change the fact that we essentially sat through the \"endless 8\" arc of The Melancholy of Suzumiya Haruhi for 26 episodes?\\n\\nThe answer: No. No it does not. \\n\\nAnd the 2deep4u ending? It is terrible. It is one of the most pathetic cop outs I\\'ve ever seen. The entirety of the anime could be summed up in that one episode were the last enemy appears, as he just conveniently and transparently explains absolutely everything through his pseudo-philosophical rantings. Yes, I understand that there were time constraints. But it doesn\\'t change the fact that it was still terrible. It was a terrible end to a terrible anime. \\n\\nThis anime is literally only praised by people that are too enthralled in their mediocre ability to understand the simplest and most transparent of symbolism, which by the way, appears to be the only thing that they actually praise. If they praise something like character, I\\'m going to go ahead and say they are lying, because they character development, if you can even call it that, is the most ridiculously shallow thing I have ever witness. Makoto from school days developed more than Shinji, and Makoto is a piece of shit.\\n\\nAnd you know what? I\\'m usually fine with transparent symbols. Unless the only thing the anime has is these transparent symbols and attempts to purport these symbols to greatness. Symbols were the sole virtue in this anime, but they were so overly used that the end result was just awful. I actually enjoyed the 5 minute cliched fantasy world at the last episode more than the entire anime. The rebuild movies exist for a reason, people! Even the original writer hated this version!\\n\\nIf you plan on wasting 26 20-minute episodes of your life, go ahead and watch this. If you want to pretend to be smart and connect shallow symbolism to a shallow and repetitive story, go ahead and watch this. If you want to pretend that over use of symbols makes an anime a masterpiece, go right ahead and waste 520 minutes of your life.\\n\\nOtherwise, just stop.',\n",
       "  \"Code Geass is the most overrated anime on the top 20 list. Although it has a fast-paced plot with quite a few surprises along the way (which is why I finished 25 episodes), I cannot help but feel that it was a complete waste of time. It seems to me that the creators of Geass sit together, with trend analysis graphs and bar charts on the table, pick out popular elements of the recent years and just throw them into this anime. So at the end, we get a villain as the main character (Death Note?), lots ofmoral dilemmas,  lots of angst and shocks, but no real focus or passion in the story.  Characters are 2-dimensional and boring, their actions are completely driven by the plot.  And the plot tries its best to deliver as much angst and surprises as possible just for the sake of it.\\n\\n  If you haven't watch it yet, don't waste your time.  And if you really have to try, trust your own feeling and forget about all the hype.  Drop it when you are bored.\",\n",
       "  'Elfen Lied is an anime that many consider controversial. It\\'s bloody, gory, perverted and just plain fucked up. Now I\\'ve seen some messed up animations in the past and I\\'m usually not against the stuff when it\\'s in good taste. That is the biggest flaw Elfen Lied has: it\\'s never in good taste. I\\'m sure someone at some point has implored you to watch this work. If that is the case, and you have not yet watched it then I beg you: DON\\'T. Story: 1/10 (If I could give this a 0, I would) What good can be said of Elfen Lied\\'s story? It\\'s a story. That\\'sit. It\\'s overtly complicated, totally unbelievable, and tries way too hard. Two people find a girl with horns and take her in. She can only say her name and gets naked too often. Then she goes nuts and kills people. All because it\\'s her nature. And it\\'s full of plot holes that once you realize, you can\\'t forget. I\\'d point them out, but they could be spoilers.\\n\\nArt: 3/10\\nThe art is just mediocre as all hell. Everyone has the same face unless they\\'re an adult apparently. The animation is also pretty bad and that\\'s not a good combination. The \"vectors\" are the dumbest looking power I\\'ve ever seen in an animation. I laughed every time I saw them used. Maybe it\\'s just the way they were drawn.\\n\\nSound: 6/10\\nThe composer did his job. The opening is great, and probably the only good thing about the animated work. The score is nice and consistent. The voice acting on the other hand, japanese or english, is just bad.\\n\\nCharacter: 1/10 (again, 0)\\nBy far the largest offense of Elfen Lied is character development. It\\'s either not there or it\\'s much too forced. And what bothered me most is just the overall mood of the characters. To put it simply, if you are a bit character, YOU ARE A HORRIBLE PERSON. NO EXCEPTIONS. One example is a group of elementary school kids beating the ever-loving hell out of a dog with no remorse whatsoever. I went to elementary school and I don\\'t remember that many serial killers in training. They acted like supervillians. Am I just supposed to believe these kids are all just pure evil at that early an age?\\n\\nEnjoyment: 1/10 (AGAIN, 0)\\nNone. I just felt awkward the whole time. I don\\'t know why I finished it, probably because once I\\'ve started an anime I don\\'t like to drop it. Regardless, the series is full of awkward moments that only made me uncomfortable. As much as this was supposed to make me care, all it did was isolate me further. Not because it shocked me, trust me I\\'ve seen worse. It was just... awkward.\\n\\nOverall: 1\\nThe worst and most overrated anime I have ever seen. I don\\'t understand how anyone could enjoy this piece of crap show. I apologize if I\\'m offending anyone, but you\\'d have to be a complete moron to actually like this irredeemable load of garbage.\\n\\nNo. You know what? I DON\\'T apologize. If you liked Elfen Lied, you have no taste and you need to be institutionalized.',\n",
       "  'Baccano is not only a great example of what can happen when a series is based on a series of novels, but also a refreshing reminder of why I watch anime. The story is centered around a group of immortal alchemists and their involvement with the Italian-American Mafia at various points from 1930 to 1932. There are three main, separate storylines occurring in parallel, one on the streets of New York in 1930, another on board the transcontinental locomotive \"The Flying Pussyfoot\" in 1931, and finally, a third one in New York in 1932. Throughout the show, this world really comes alive, thanks to the animation,music, hairstyles, and clothes all contributing to a viewer\\'s sense of what that era in American history was like.\\n\\nThe anime constantly switches from one setting to another at a moment\\'s notice, has events occur wildly out of order, and, to add to the confusion, there are a couple dozen important characters to remember,each with their own back story. While this is completely normal for a novel, it\\'s unusual for an anime, especially one with only 13 episodes.However, Baccano pulls it off, with everything from the art style to the opening theme making it all digestible for the viewer.\\n\\nEach character, while not particularly deep, is likable, unique, and far from predictable. They\\'re one-dimensional, but that dimension is interesting and funny, and in several cases, even receives development during the course of the series.\\n\\nThis approach to character creation is a strength here; \"Baccano\" moves at an extremely quick, frenetic pace, with a plethora of different characters. Choosingto make all the characters interesting instead of focusing on just one,to the detriment of everyone else, was a wise move on the part of the creators.\\n\\nThe story is remarkable for its repeated, constant use of deus ex machina plot devices. In every episode, a great deal of purely accidental events occur that completely change the course of the storyline. A man attempting a magic trick involving fire accidentally burns a house down, and it just so happens to be the secret lab of a character creating the elixir of life. Two characters steal a car and decide to get away, just so happening to hit the main villain right before he can kill one of the main protagonists.\\n\\nIn fact, two of the characters, Miria Harvent and Isaac Dion, are nothing more than agents of these bizarre, accidental circumstances. At first, they only seem like comic relief, being an idiotic, overly cheerful couple that commits crimes like stealing candy bars, fancy hats, and the door of a museum.\\n\\nHowever, throughout the story, they come in contact with most of the other main characters, and through their incredibly stupid deeds,optimistic and sanguine personalities, and purely accidental physical acts, change everyone\\'s lives for the good, defeat the bad guys, and save lives... without even realizing it.\\n\\nNormally, I\\'d criticize a story for so many absurd and improbable events, but since random circumstance are a central theme of Baccano and is openly acknowledged as such, it becomes both a humorous and entertaining element of the plot.\\n\\nThe art and music of the show are used to enhance and highlight the characters and story. The opening theme is a catchy blues theme that also lists all the main characters by name. Throughout the series,we hear upbeat, 30\\'s era jazz and swing, which helps immerse the viewer in the story\\'s environment.\\n\\nThe animation style uses very unique faces for all the main characters,making them easier to distinguish. Everything besides the character faces is drawn with very indistinct, smoky lines and a warm palette,giving one the impression of hazy Mafia backrooms, with green felt,cards, huge cigars, and Jack Daniel\\'s whiskey.\\n\\nOverall, the pacing, humor, and action in the series is great, and the plot climaxes in the final episode, resolving most of the mysteries earlier in the series.\\n\\nNow, for me, a \"9\" means a masterpiece classic, and I think Baccano deserves this title. However, there is one problem I have with the series.\\n\\nAs good as the show was, none of the episodes in the series were spectacular.Nothing I saw mesmerized me, or made me feel I had just witnessed a work of supreme genius. It was a good story, with good characters,excellent sound and art, directed well.\\n\\nBefore the hardcore Baccano fanatics go crazy, ask yourself; what episode here stood out for you, really amazed you with its brilliance?The last episode was the most satisfying because it answered all the questions, but what episode had something unexpected, magnificent, and fantastic in it?\\n\\nNitpicking aside, Baccano is among the top 10-15 anime I\\'ve ever watched, and highly recommended to any fan of the medium.',\n",
       "  \"Whisper of the Heart is an excellent coming of age story that can appeal to everyone. When I first watched this movie I was disappointed that it wasn't some epic fantasy adventure. Upon a second watching I fell in love with this film. It captures the struggles of an artist and all the doubts that come along with it. The feelings come across very naturally, each character has their own worries. If you are an artist or feel lost in life this movie hits close to home. My only complaint was the soundtrack. In comparison to the scores of other Studio Ghibli films it lackedthe magic it normally has. Besides that the movie overall still managed to have its own charm. I love how the art makes everyday life seem beautiful. Thank you for reading :)\",\n",
       "  \"As a fan of the sci-fi and psychological genre, I was super excited to watch Ergo Proxy--I had heard of its similarities to Psycho Pass, Darker than Black, Ghost in the Shell to name a few, all great animes. However, while I did enjoy the characters and story, it did feel like the plot was getting out of hand, increasingly so as the series neared the end. One of the first things I noticed about Ergo Proxy was its art style, particularly how the characters were drawn rather realistically in comparison to current anime. The muted tones and intense expressions suited the mood of ErgoProxy well and at times made for some really badass wallpapers. Plus, normal proportions is always something I look for in an anime.\\n\\nI can't recall the sound of Ergo Proxy too well which might as well say it wasn't all that memorable to me. However, the English opening and ending (Kiri by Monoral and Paranoid Android by Radiohead) are both awesome songs that suit the anime perfectly.\\n\\nI loved the main characters of Ergo Proxy: Lil Mayer, Vincent Law, and Pino of course. The instant friendship between Vincent and Pino was adorable and how they broke down Lil's walls throughout the series was honestly heartwarming. The character development in the series I felt was pretty natural and not too sudden. It was interesting to see how some characters opened up and grew as a person while others went more and more off the rails. I did feel like there was a definite lack of depth and background overall but that ties into the show's general vagueness...\\n\\nWhich brings me to say that Ergo Proxy has got to be one of the most confusing animes I've ever seen. While I generally appreciate plots open to interpretation, this show took that idea and ran with it. (I know I watched episode 14 at least three times before I got it and that was with reading several different explanations.) Half the time I was lost. It certainly doesn't help how some episodes seemed like single episode stories instead of following the overall storyline. It felt like there were gaps in the story that too often left me confused on how they got there or who that person was. Ergo Proxy never really gives direct answers (well, rarely) and most of the time I had to go by the assumptions and interpretations of other watchers. Thankfully some of our fellow viewers are smart cookies and their explanations make sense; it's because of them that I can appreciate the genius, albeit confusing as heck, plot. Even so, there were frequent differences in explanations and honestly? at some point, it takes away some enjoyment of the anime when you have to do extensive research to understand it. Despite all the confusion, you can tell that the writers did their homework in creating Ergo Proxy and I think it's a pretty smart show. They pepper allusions and foreshadowing all over the place and even though yes I have complained I must admit I did learn things from watching this show. But only after completion of the show and reading my fair share of analyses do I kinda get what's going on. Just gotta say... if you really want to fully appreciate Ergo Proxy, you're in for a rewatch.\",\n",
       "  'In youth, we tend to over-exaggerate, over-analyse, and over-experience any event. That ice cream we ate for the first time as a child will never quite taste that good again; even as teenagers and later adults, we chase after these childhood fantasies, never quite giving up on finding that metaphorical \"fountain of youth.\" What\\'s the most likely thing, then, to happen if one were to experience childhood trauma? Perhaps insanity in later life, a cold heart, apathy, denial, or maybe all of the above? What exactly does happen? Ano Hi Mita Hana no Namae wo Bokutachi wa Mada Shiranai explores this phenomenon that happens whenwe simply can\\'t let go of the past, because in all of us, there exists a child that yearns for the good ol\\' days. \\n\\nStory: 9/10\\n\\nWhen you experience something earth-shattering (that\\'s awful) isn\\'t the first thing you want to do is forget about it? To bury it with something, anything to get rid of those horrid memories? Don\\'t you just want to curl up in a ball and forget reality for maybe, ever? Years have passed since a tragic accident happened between what used to be five really close friends. How do they interact? How will they react to one another if they become forced in close proximity? Isn\\'t something so terrible it\\'s hard to speak of it without bringing up memories supposed to be left buried? Yadomi and the gang struggle to make peace with their past, all the while finding out who they are and what they mean to each other in the present. \\n\\nI was shocked, more like flabbergasted, when the series laid out. It opened up faster than expected and completely caught me off guard. Where I thought there was a continuity, it turned out to be a broken link in the old rusted chain of the past. Maybe there weren\\'t many plot twists; maybe the story got a little repetitive; maybe it was just a little too short. However, the anime moves fast, and you have to keep up. It really was beautiful story-telling; the truth is a dark, dark secret many are willing to risk their lives to keep hidden. Many times, it\\'s to protect people you love or to have the burden of it on yourself. Yadomi and the gang have to learn: is it worth it to keep your true emotions hidden? Or are you actually hurting those around you for your own individualistic needs? This anime delves deeper than simple human or friendship or even love relationships. It answers questions much deeper that pervade the subconscious. \\n\\nArt: 9/10\\n\\nInterestingly enough, many a time the art wasn\\'t gloomy. In fact, it was almost like a juxtaposition of light and dark: when Yadomi was happy, sometimes the colors flitted about between midnight and sunshine. However, the majority of the time, the colors stayed neutral; but there were key moments where light had an interesting role in keeping up the story.... The characters were drawn normal, skinny, not too flashy and not to dull either. The animation wasn\\'t disappointing in the least. I didn\\'t see many flaws; however, nothing really jumped out at me. However, I do want to mention the facial expressions. They were accurate and went anywhere between lighthearted laughter to deadly serious in seconds. Each character had their moments, and what fantastic moments they were.\\n\\nSound: 9/10\\n\\nThe score is high, not because of the OP and ED, but because of the voice acting. My goodness, I have never seen such raw emotion in a voice before. The pain is almost tangible; you can literally almost empathize with every fiber of the being, even if you weren\\'t there and this isn\\'t your life. It was beautiful, really, to hear the sounds of human emotion, of raw pain, pleasure, or sadness, to creep into the voices of each character. Normally, the voice acting is pretty sub-par, but that\\'s because nothing compares to the depth at which these morals and lessons pierce through one\\'s fragile childhood heart. The OP is upbeat, a little slow; the ED is sad and depressed, almost like a love song to a deceased wife or husband. It\\'s not like I didn\\'t like them, it\\'s that I thought they were pretty plain, considering the weight this anime carries.\\n\\nCharacter: a perfect 10/10\\n\\nPeople have blasted this anime because of how \"static\" or \"inflexible\" these characters are; how they don\\'t change throughout the anime, and how each of them is surprisingly bland. Who in their right mind would drastically, completely change because of a trauma? I know it sounds wrong to judge others so harshly, but the reason people go into depression or turn to alcohol or drugs when they experience such trauma isn\\'t because they changed as a person, but because they want to get out of the past. But it haunts them, day in and day out, never ceasing to be erased from the curse and blessing that is the human memory. Yadomi exhibits this through his attachment issues; Anjou through jealously; Hisakawa, through belongingness; Atsuma, through clinging to a hopeless past; Tsurumi through learning to let go; and Homna Meiko? You\\'re going to have to find out.\\n\\nThis fantastic anime takes average kids, high schoolers, and really brings out basic qualities of a person that can\\'t be changed from the past. Interestingly, it does so with accuracy and gusto, with plenty drama in between. The character score is a perfect 10/10 because they followed the human condition with such perfection I tend to never see. Maybe this is my opinion; maybe you are supposed to change after a series of events happen. I personally have experienced trauma; maybe not in this sort of way nor in the magnitude, but it has happened. And you don\\'t change. That\\'s simple and plain. You slowly turn into a shell of yourself if you don\\'t let your emotions out from time to time. Externally, you may lose friends, become antisocial, or turn to other forms of relieving yourself. But inside, you stay who you inherently are, reliving that experience for the rest of your life, afraid to change because change is what made said event happen in the first place. So coming from personal experience, these characters really nailed that topic. Hard.\\n\\nOverall, I was more than astounded at what this had to offer. Originally recommended by friends, I only agreed to watch it because it was barely 11 episodes. Trust me, you won\\'t be disappointed in the least. There was enough drama to keep you riveted in your seat, enough emotions to keep your head spinning, and even some metaphysical references that keep the story interesting as a whole. I loved every juicy bit of this wonderful show; it took the worst out of people, and could turn it around so quickly to show the best of humanity. So if you know where to look, hide and seek is a really easy game to win....',\n",
       "  \"Odd Taxi is a unique show, and I mean that in the best way possible. A lot of animes these days choose the safest approach possible, and end up kind of formulaic as a result. This show is the opposite of that trend. Everything from the characters, to the art style, to the comedy, to the plot itself is a breath of fresh air. I had been hearing for some time about how great this show was, but I kinda assumed that it was a furry show or something like that, and I never really bothered to give it a chance around the time it wasairing, pretty much entirely due to the art style.\\n\\nWell, I'm glad I decided to watch it.\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nStory: 8/10\\n\\nThe story is a little bit wild and hard to follow, with a ton of branching paths and characters, but I think that's part of what makes it so great. Slowly piecing together what's going on through stories from all of the characters was pretty awesome. It's one of the most unique story telling styles that I've seen in an anime, and I really liked it.\\nThere were some great twists and turns along the course of the story, none of which were exactly 'surprising' per se, but I think that's due to how well written the story was (as counter intuitive as that sounds). The mystery was built up so well, that you pretty much figure out for yourself what is happening along the way, just based on the minor clues and details that characters drop for you. The way the story was written and told made the mystery incredibly engrossing, and always had me on the edge of my seat, figuratively at least. \\nThe ending twist in particular is probably the best in all of anime. What they did was so bold, that I almost couldn't believe it when it happened. I'll just say that the show fundamentally changes on episode 13, and leave it at that due to spoilers.\\nOdd Taxi isn't perfect in the story department though, as much as I wish it was. For a show as thought out as this one, it seems like some things were overlooked. For example, apparently in all of Tokyo, there is one taxi driver, two police officers, two criminals, one youtuber, one doctor, one band... you get the point. The amount of coincidental meetings and events that are required to advance the story gets pretty goofy after a certain point. It's the only way a story like this could work, but it's still a little silly. \\nI still liked the story a lot, even though it has it's flaws. It was told in such a fun, unique way, that it's hard to knock that many points off of it.\\n\\nArt: 6/10\\n\\nThe best thing I can say about the art style is that all of the character designs and world were really well done; apart from that, it's mediocre at best.\\nThe 3d cgi is bad, to say the least. For a show called 'Odd Taxi', I'd expect the taxi to be a little less painful to look at. None of the cars fit in with the rest of the world, due to being entirely cheap looking 3d models. It kinda reminds me of the 3d animation from an early 2000s cartoon, like Jimmy Neutron. Not really what you'd expect in a modern anime. It doesn't really take away from the experience at all, which is why I'm not lowering the overall score because of this, but it did break my immersion at some points.\\n\\nSound: 9/10\\n\\nThe voice acting is really solid. All of the voice actors fit the characters almost perfectly. The casting is great. There aren't any incredible performances that will knock you off of your feet when you hear them, but it's solid across the board. The major standouts for me where Odokowa, Yano, Tanaka, and the homo-sapien's voice actors.\\n\\nThe music is AMAZING. The opening is one of my favorites of all time already, and the rest of the soundtrack is insane too. It's honestly worth watching this show just to listen to the music, which I can't say that about very many animes, or shows in general. Seriously, even if you don't want to watch the show, at least go listen to the opening on youtube or something, it's so good.\\n\\nCharacters: 9/10\\n\\nThe characters are hands-down the best part about Odd Taxi. All of them (seriously, all of them) are really good. I don't think there was a single character in this show that I didn't like. Their struggles and interactions were painfully realistic, and had me empathizing with even the most evil of characters. \\nThere are so many good characters that I can't even list them all. When I say that the cast is loaded, I mean it. With only 13 episodes, they managed to build up a cast of 15+ characters to near perfection, doing what most shows wouldn't be able to do if they were given hundreds of episodes. It's always more impressive to me when relatively short animes build up believable characters, given the time constraints that they have to work with. Odd Taxi is the perfect example of that.\\nI know that it's kind of hard to believe that show with a walrus taxi driver as it's main character has some of the best written characters in anime, but it does.\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOverall: 9/10\\n\\nI finished Odd Taxi in a little over 24 hours. That's the quickest I've ever finished an anime. So yeah, I liked it. Sure, it's not the longest show in the world, but still. Given it's length, it's the kind of show that I implore everyone to at least give a chance. It really has everything you could want in a 13 episode anime. Great characters, a great story, great music, great comedy... I can go on. There's a lot to like about Odd Taxi. Start to finish, this show will grab you, and it won't let go. \\nThis show lived up to the hype, and then some. I wouldn't say that it's a masterpiece or anything, but it's a truly great mystery/crime show, with some exceptional characters and storytelling. I don't think it needs to be more than that.\\nI enjoyed nearly every minute of this show, and I was pretty much glued to the screen. Like I said in the start of this review, this show is a breath of fresh air, and I mean that. Everything it tries to do is unique for a modern anime, and it pulls it all off seemingly effortlessly. Go watch it.\",\n",
       "  \"When this anime was airing, I had over 10 different animes that I was watching, and during that time this anime was my most favorite one. Even for a harem genre lover such as myself, I would be lying if I said I didn't enjoy it as I watched despite the lack of nosebleeds. Story: 10 I rarely ever give a story a 10, but there were several factors that gave this anime the god score. First, the originality in the overall plot was a thumbs up as most stories nowdays unfortunately have similars to some other type of story, whether intentional or not, but this animehad a plot that (at least for me) I haven't seen before. Second, the pacing was good, and while some of you may not like the 24 episodes, it helped keep the pace good and steady as this would have not been as enjoyable if it was crammed into a 12 episode format. Third, no offplot events, or in other words, no random episodes thrown in to be fillers. Pay attention as there is plot development in all the episodes.\\n\\nArt: 9\\nI give it a 9 because (besides a personal opinion of there is no such thing as perfection) of the overall good fight scenes, however the detailed art may make you queasy, especially if you plan to get a uncensored version when the dvds come out. If your used to the gore, then pay no heed as the art is going to be to your liking.\\n\\nSound: 10\\nI personally can't say that I'm an expert at judging music, but as far as I notice all the music and sounds fitted right into the places where they belonged, as well as the opening and closing tracks were pleasing to the ears. The background sound overall was excellent and well placed by the makers.\\n\\nCharacters: 9\\nI give the characters a 9 for that many of the characters are fresh, besides the girl the protaganist likes. The majority of the characters are just overall not well seen around anime as the plot, as stated as before, is pretty original allowing for new kind of characters to be seen. (Forwarning, if you are a kind of person who wants everyone to live and nobody to have died, you might want to toss that aside as there are 1 or 2 deaths that will cause at least a tear)\\n\\nEnjoyment: 10\\nDespite the fact that I'm a harem, ecchi type lover as shown through my anime list, this anime will forever be on the top animes that I would recommend to anyone of a serious, slightly humorous, gore anime. With the action, drama, and the various aspects of this anime,  I'm sure you will love it as much as I have.\",\n",
       "  '!! SPOILER-FILLED !! Welcome to the countryside! The air is clean, the grass is green; community is tightly-knit in this open expanse where the appreciation of nature is commonplace, its hospitality free of charge. Abounding in agriculture, the sprouts of familial love fully grown. A place to escape the suffocating crowded town where inclusivity is hard-earned, such that loneliness befriends kids in the outer sphere. Simultaneously, a haven to recuperate, where one can breathe life from the energy stored in all that\\'s around us, connecting us to our definite homes. Sounds like many other Studio Ghibli stories, huh. Undeniably, When Marnie Was There is not an exceptionof having the staple nostalgic Ghibli air making up the atmospheric elements of the film. Very much grounded and light, it felt most reminiscent to older creations of the studio such as Totoro and Only Yesterday. However, what separates it from many others in the catalogue, to me personally, is its use of a contemporary aspect in storytelling execution blurring the lines between reality and fantasy, made more bewildering due to the absolutely normal-looking setting where only the mansion was even a bit incongruous; but that\\'s really not enough to set up an environment that is in itself leaning on fantastical. Because of that imbalance dancing together with harmony, When Marnie Was There was--especially in my first watch--a full-blown fever dream.\\n\\n~A Quick Recap~\\nThe story goes as follows: young and sick Sasaki Anna who lost her parents and therefore living together with foster ones experiences struggles relatable to many children of our generation: the foreboding darkness of the future resulting from being outcast made less escapable by introversion, the loneliness that comes with it, stacked further from awareness of one\\'s physical ails pushing their inner thoughts to conclude that one is a burden deserving this suffering. She uses art--specifically visual art in the form of drawing--to capture life as she sees it from the outside.\\n\\nThis is an important point to note as we progress the movie with doubt of our sight\\'s visual perceptions.\\n\\nAfter a doctor\\'s recommendation, Anna\\'s surrogate parents sent her to live with relatives in the countryside for the time being. Passed around and moved from place to place once again. In the countryside she spends the time in remote tranquility idly by, until she stumbles upon the majesty of the Marsh House where she eventually discovers and interacts with a mysterious Marnie who blatantly expresses her earnest longing for Anna whom she never even met before in that point in the story. Together they get to know more about each other as they dance around the gardens barefoot in the moonlight, partake in late day picnics, and rowing wooden boats to and fro.\\n\\nAlready questions emerge like an array of jacks-in-the-box upon Marnie\\'s appearance in the previously old abandoned mansion. Overtime, as weird occurrences interject between their interactions such as their sudden departures like a fading of the dream, one continues to stare at the movie in bewilderment (I\\'m looking at you, silo scene). And it is not only until the very end, in Marnie\\'s reveal as Anna\\'s grandmother, that things immediately gather around in a one big \"OHHHHHHHHHHH\" moment born from its immense recontextualization of Anna and Marnie\\'s bonding in present time. Prior to that, we coincide with Anna\\'s confusion at this mysterious turn of events amidst the ordinary wetlands of Hokkaido.\\n\\nMarnie\\'s childhood and her drive to shatter generational trauma by striving to become a great parent despite her lapses and exhaustion, her bonding with the infant Anna until she leaves this world for the next, was to say the least, heartbreaking.\\n\\n~The Stars Align~\\nAnd I\\'d just like to mention how grateful I am of the existence of fictional stories. It is inseparable with an individual\\'s reality, and depending on recent circumstances, experiencing one would be akin to the awe in seeing up-close all the stars aligning. And even in the domain of the story itself, the reveal clicked all the right buttons and completed all the puzzle pieces so satisfyingly.\\n\\nI watched this movie back in the week where we heard my grandmother from a city hours away, with travel heavily halted as it was the peak of the pandemic, was hospitalized, and I just chose a Ghibli film on my list to distract myself with the comfort of staple nostalgia. It was a blind decision; I knew nothing about this. But fate had it appropriate for me to meet this piece, and it truly made for an unforgettable experience. When Marnie Was There allowed me to connect with my grandmother miles away in the form of memories--warm, gentle memories. Scent, sight, all of my sensory mechanisms were heightened to their utmost such that I was essentially reliving the past inside her home. Thus manifests the power of fiction, allowing one to create a world and transport itself into it, time and place neither an obstacle of preclusion.\\n\\nAlthough the voice acting direction definitely needs improvement as I cannot deny it fluctuated the atmosphere of critical moments a few times, it is not enough of an impediment in embracing any ailing mortal with familial love. The sound design spouses the visual makeup seamlessly like key to a lock in virtualizing an environment wherein the viewer could physically bask in the setting of the movie, complete with its constituents, as if we are wrapped in a full-body green screen but with it directly influencing all of our senses to live in that virtual world. At least, that was the degree of resonance that I felt. The director\\'s aim towards psychological healing through the help of the environment extends even beyond the characters on the screen; I, the viewer outside the screen, was myself healed by the environment. Portrayed so vividly, I could not help but succumb to my yearning of the peaceful countryside away from the toxins of the city I\\'ve lived in all my life (which, although I do not hate, still does not stop me from wishing for a change of pace), and drown in the relaxing spa massage of nostalgia and longing. In technical qualities, it did not fall short.\\n\\nAnd it is just the way in which the story was told, filled with so much fun and beauty from pleasant animation adorning the author\\'s message of a loved one\\'s presence being everywhere. The use of nature and its ubiquity is in accordance with the existence of people. Despite the clutches of death stopping their heart from beating, in the realm of the mind\\'s subjectivity, they never cease to be. The mind is so powerful so as to be capable of conjuring the abstract and putting it into the jar of concreteness. We as humans gifted with mental capacities are able to be creators of virtually anything we could think of. The many mediums of art unlock our potential to do so. I reiterate once again Anna\\'s talent in drawing. Despite her asthma and depression, with the help of the environment stirring up her memories of Marnie, Anna was able to tap into her enhanced imagination to be together with her grandmother once again. Of course, these were all metaphorical in basically telling us about connecting with people we deem special and the genuine love our families hold for us, but in the context of the film, it still adds to the coherence of its storytelling.\\n\\n~Conclusion~\\nI cannot stress its creativity in adopting such message and turning it into something more beautiful than it is. It made for a more inspiring tale. When Marnie \"was\" there turned, for Anna, when Marnie \"is\" there beside her, as she goes through a journey to connect the past together with the present.\\n\\nAn additional note, \"Fine On the Outside\" was a perfect sendoff. The soundtrack actually became my number one playlist on Spotify Wrapped back in 2021. Bless Muramatsu Takatsugu for those enchanting compositions I could always fall back to when the waves start crashing. All hits, no misses, my good sir.\\n\\nWhen Marnie Was There film converges souls long separated by life and death in unification through memories, reviving what has laid to rest, in elaborate attempts to de-nourish the roots of the scars permeating all around a young, lonely girl through the revitalizing vigor the love of a caring family member holds by bestowing upon the resurrected a chance to transmit the beauty of life to the living in the form of innocent youth. When Marnie Was There is a reconnection, with people and the environment, calming the chaos running rampant within from the frustrations of loneliness and general ails. A healing movie I\\'m glad to have rewatched.',\n",
       "  'Bakuman: the REVIEW This anime is PIKA-APPROVED!!! Story: After seeing his creepy doodles of the female lead, Middle schooler Takagi is inspired to ask classmate Saiko to join their quest to make Japanese comics aka manga. I know very much nothing about the world as manga as the only manga I\\'ve ever read was about this owl and his weird adventures in woodlands or some shit. ANYway, it explains stuff very clear, and it always left you wanting more! Art: Art is excellent. plus those manga scenes are delicious, like a giant freaking crepe thing that they sell and yet the Japanese are confused by American portionsof food. \\n\\nSound: first of all, a dude sing the theme song. \\n\\nCharacter: here\\'s where it just makes me insanely mad. What\\'s his name, saiko and his girlfriend yet not girlfriend are SO FUCKING ANNOYING LIKE WHO THE HELL WAITS FOR THEIR IMPOSSIBLE (YES, THEIR DREAMS ARE FREAKING IMPOSSIBLE) TO not just date, cuz they can\\'t even talk to eachother cuz \"oh look at me, i\\'m shy and innocent and bashful and pure so that\\'s \"KAWAII DESU\". We get it ANIME, you just LOOOOVVVEEE bashful types. But they\\'re such losers in the love department. Is this why the Japanese youth are terrible at dating? ONCE A FUCKING AGAIN, anime proves it\\'s TRASH at the core. But props for no annoying panty shots/ nude scenes.\\n\\nEnjoyment. besides Saiko\\'s terrible dating instincts (that marriage would realistically go in the trash) it\\'s by far one of the best mangas i mean animes i mean near homoerotic stories I\\'ve ever seen. I mean, I\\'d let Takagi bone me. And I\\'m not even into blondes!!! \\n\\nOverall: if you like bro stories with crappy romance arcs, but just amazing insight into the world of manga, then I\\'d advise it for your weirdly specific tastes. OR if you just like to see kids fresh out of middle school have amazing success which will subsequently make you consider committing seppukku cuz let\\'s be real... you spend all your time watching this crap.\\n\\nme too bro,\\nme too',\n",
       "  'Black Butler is an odd mix of comedy, drama, fantasy and yaoi undertones. There are few anime out there that can combine comedy and drama without ruining one of these elements, sadly enough Black Butler is not one of these shows. The comedy totally ruins the drama and is often unfunny and immature, the bishies and yaoi tropes were unnecessary and the fantasy didn\\'t make sense. But for some reason, this anime is in the top 50 most popular anime on MAL, why? Probably because it had bishies, a hot butler, nice music, pretty animation and a gay death god that tries to make senpainotice him, oh so hilarious. \\n\\n~Story~ 3/10\\nWe meet our main character, a 10 year old boy (who looks like a girl) and gives his soul in exchange for revenge against the people who killed his parents and tortured him. Two years have passed and our main character, Ciel Phantomhive, has a demon butler who helps him with his revenge (and cleans his house). Though they don\\'t really seem to care about taking revenge, because they\\'re way to busy with drinking tea and solving crimes. The queen decided to make Ciel her personal detective for some kind of reason, we never really discover why, but now Ciel wastes his time with solving crimes. And for some kind of reason are there always supernatural creatures involved in those crimes, so Sebastian can show of his fabulous demon fighting skills, while fighting them. The first episode was amazing, there was a dark atmosphere, the main characters looked interesting and the plot twist near the end was great. And then everything went downhill, our main character and his demon butler get a mission, they discover that something supernatural is involved, they solve the mystery and Sebastian says \"I\\'m one hell of a butler\", then there is another mission or a filler, in the last case the viewer is tortured with the Phantomhive servants (also known as comedic relief no one asked for) screwing up things and sucking at everything except for killing people. This kind of \"comedic relief\" totally ruined the drama in the anime, even a cliché sad backstory didn\\'t make these servants more interesting, because their only use in this anime is screwing up everything. \\n\\nThe setting also fails, no one behaves like they\\'re supposed to do in the Victorian age. Still, the first part of the story is decent, some episodes were actually good, but the second half was just a convoluted mess. Nothing that happened made sense, characters behaved out of character (Sebastian leaves Ciel for a stupid reason), plot twists came out of nowhere and unexplained supernatural occurrences happened. Only the ending was great, the last minutes of the show were better than the whole second half together. But then, the creators decided to ruin that by creating a sequel that just erased the great ending of the first anime, like it never happened. Amazing job writers!\\n{CONCLUSION}\\nThe story was decent in the first half and a total mess in the second half. There were way too many fillers and none of these fillers were funny or interesting, they were just a waste of time. Also the gay undertones (everything about Ciel, Grell\\'s behavior towards Sebastion, crossdressing for no good reason and so on) were unnecessary. It didn\\'t add anything to the plot, but it just attracted those annoying teenage girls who love yaoi pairings and name themselves \\'missPhantomhive489\\' on YouTube.  \\n\\n~Art~ 8/10\\nThe animation was very good, especially the backgrounds and clothes. The anime is set the Victorian age setting and the buildings were very realistic and fitted the time period (the behavior of the characters didn\\'t). The character designs were quite feminine, Ciel really looks like a girl even without wearing a dress, but not bad. Every character had their own distinct features, which made them stand out. The animation was also pretty good during the fights and during the comedic relief moments (I still hate these moments, but the animation looked good)\\n{CONCLUSION}\\nThe animation was great. Yes, bishies everywhere but the backgrounds were spectacular. Not a single character looked boring and the clothes were very detailed. The animation was probably one of the best things about this show. And I have to admit, Sebastian throwing knives and forks at random baddies  looks extremely epic. \\n\\n~Music~ 9/10\\nThe opening song \"Kiss of Monochrome\" is great and really fits the more dramatic parts of the show. The first ending song \"I\\'m ALIVE!\" is an upbeat J-pop song that fits the stupid comedic relief moments. The chibi art style of the animation of the ending song was actually quite amusing. But the second ending song is on a whole new level, \"Lacrimosa\" is sad, melancholic and extremely beautiful. The background music was nothing special but certainly not bad and the voice acting was very good. Especially Sebastian\\'s voice actor did an amazing job. The music was simply put great.\\n{CONCLUSION}\\nThe first ending song was okay and the opening and second ending song were amazing. The background music was good and the (Japanese) voice actors did a great job. The best thing about Black Butler was the music, and that is not meant as an insult, the music was just damn great.\\n\\n~Characters~ 2/10\\nOur main character is a snobby, spoiled, edgy, teenage bishie, sorry Ciel but you\\'re not only an annoying person, you\\'re also a bad character. His motivations are unclear, his behavior is inconsistent and drinking tea does not make anyone seem \\'cool\\'. Also, he\\'s just a walking mannequin, the creators were too busy with making him wear fancy dresses to give him a likeable (or at least tolerable) personality. Sebastian is just a hot and perfect butler, he seems more like a perfect boyfriend than a scary demon. Which was probably on purpose, because now the fangirls have someone to ship Ciel with, or themselves. Though he has as much depth as a paddling pool, he\\'s enjoyable to watch (something that can\\'t be said about Ciel). His fighting scenes were pretty cool and he has style. And of course, let\\'s not forget \\'I\\'m one hell of a butler\\'. He\\'s a badly written character who\\'s a joy to watch. And then we have the Phantomhive servants, they were useless, whiny, annoying and not funny. Their \\'sad\\' background stories were extremely cliché and they ruined every attempt to make this show dramatic (or a bit more mature). Grell is a gay shinigami, who wants to bang Sebastian and just like the servants, his role is to ruin every attempt to make this show serious, oh and his constant nosebleeds are not funny at all. And there is Elizabeth, the most whiny and useless love interest for a protagonist since Misa from Death Note (and even Misa has more brains than this walking candy cane) and her attempts to make everything \\'cute\\' annoyed the heck out of me. I was literally cheering when Ciel tried to slap her. Every other side character is either boring or horrible (aside from Undertaker, he was pretty cool).\\n{CONCLUSION}\\nIt it so difficult to create cast with at least one character who\\'s tolerable, let alone well written? Ciel is a edgy, whiny and spoiled teenage boy living in Victorian England, but behaving like he lives in the present. Sebastian (that name is so damn cliché for an English butler) is way too perfect and lacks any form of depth, but it\\'s a joy to watch him kill people with knives and forks. Grell is a joke, he\\'s gay for Sebastian and that\\'s everything about him. The servants are annoying \\'comedic relief\\' and Elizabeth has a place in my top ten most annoying anime love interests. She did not a single useful thing in 24 episodes, not a single thing! The rest of the cast is not even worth talking about and Undertaker is okay.\\n\\n~Enjoyment~ 5/10\\nThis was my third anime and when I watched it for the first time, I actually enjoyed it, but when I rewatched it, I realized how flawed this show actually is. It is possible to enjoy this anime when you\\'re either new to anime in general, when you just want to have some fun with a supernatural show without thinking to much about the story or the characters or when you love yaoi undertones and bishies in dresses. It\\'s not a horrible show, but the plot is a mess, the characters are weak and the yaoi undertones are annoying. Still, if you have a lot of time to waste or you just want to turn of your brain, then you might want to watch this show, in every other case, there are way better anime out there!  \\n{CONCLUSION}\\nIt\\'s an under average show. Certainly not the worst anime, but also not worth the praise it gets and the enormous fan base. If you value you free time and prefer good anime, I would suggest that you skip this show. Oh and fans, can you please stop making creepy Ciel x Sebastian fanart? That\\'s pedofilic demon yaoi, just don\\'t. Peace!',\n",
       "  'We have all been familiar with the concept of aliens landing on Earth and trying to achieve world domination. This has been recycled in films and TV shows many times successfully or disappointingly. However, an anime which came out in winter 2014 and finished early 2015 more or less dealt with the theme of man versus aliens. But, this particular anime portrays this concept in such a way that seems very plausible if you ask me! The story is about a high school boy named Izumi Shinichi *yep ANOTHER high school nerd* who lives in Tokyo with his parents. His life was normal until oneparticular day these alien lifeforms known as Parasytes rain down from the sky and take humans as their hosts by taking control of their brain. A parasite threatens to do the same to Shinichi while he is asleep, however it is unable to do so because Shinichi was wearing headphones *I swear Beats missed a perfect opportunity to have a product placement over here*.  Anyway, the parasite then gets inside his right arm and is unable to seize Shinichi’s brain. As a result, Shinichi now has to deal with the fact his right hand is a dangerous alien being that now solely depends on our him to survive. He names the parasite in his right hand Migi which is Japanese for ‘right hand’. The series mainly focuses on the two’s relationship and the encounters they have with other parasytes. Not to mention, the struggles Shinichi faces in this show.\\n\\nNow, even before I started watching this show I knew that I was in for a treat. The story sounded very interesting despite the fact I’m not the biggest sci-fi fan. And also because the Parasyte manga in case you didn’t know was published during the 80s and it got an anime adaptation like recently. So, I was really curious to see whether the anime would take place during that time period or will take place in modern times.  Well, they chose the latter and I must admit it works to the show’s advantage very much.\\n\\nThe modern setting in my opinion was necessary in the development of Migi’s character if you ask me. Because throughout the show he does gain his knowledge from the internet. Migi thanks to the internet ends up being a walking encyclopaedia, while the rest of us waste our time debating about the colours of a stupid dress! The show may not have had the most original setting considering the fact parasites and ghouls apparently lurk in the same area, however they successfully managed to tell the story in a different time period!\\n\\nThe characters in the show are relatable, real people who have their fair share of problems. First of all, let’s talk about our main lead Shinichi. He reminds me of another character who deals with a drastic change in his life, and the way they both get developed is more or less the same.  Shinichi at first is weak and frail guy who was living in a  harem anime until the parasites arrived. The next thing Shinichi knew that he jumped from Clannad to fucking Tokyo Ghoul.\\n\\nBut, in all seriousness I really liked the character of Shinichi. He has been through a lot in the series and instead of being a wuss  he does whatever he can to survive and he constantly tries to help the ones around him. He also becomes a badass after the death of a certain character which causes him to become stoic like Migi and the rest of the parasites. Then again after the death of another important character Shinichi becomes human again which I thought was very ironic and also well executed.\\n\\nNow, his right hand is a character of his own. I loved how Migi’s character was very developed in the series where he starts of this calm and emotionless parasite that always thinks practically and will do anything for only his survival. He doesn’t really care about Shinichi at first let alone the humans. However, as the series progresses Migi and Shinichi’s friendship blossoms.\\n\\nI would also like to talk about Tamura Reiko, who starts of as a brutal and emotionless parasite that ends up being pregnant with a human child.  A first she was considering to experiment with it or eat it, however the woman has a change of heart and actually grows to care for the child. After twenty episodes of seeing what huge assholes parasites can be, I didn’t expect one of them to actual develop such human characteristics. And I am glad that she did change which caused her to be more likeable and relatable. I wish she would have gotten more screen time, but none the less she was one of the best characters the show had to offer.\\n\\nThe rest sadly were not very well developed ranging from Shinchi’s parents to his friends. Shinichi’s love interest does get some development towards the end but throughout the series she was nothing more than just a potato. Then again, I guess being a potato is better than being what the rest of those undeveloped losers are.\\n\\nAlso, only one death was truly sad whereas the others just didn’t make the audience care that much. Mainly because the characters didn’t get much development before having them literally chopped off from the show. Also, their deaths were also very predictable due to all the flashback and dream sequences.\\n\\nAnother thing was a real let down was its inconsistent pacing. In my opinion the show started out great, but through out the middle it got a little slow however by the last seven or eight episodes things became twice as great than it was at the beginning. It’s not a major issue in fact, but it’s slow progress in the middle might cause people to drop the show. However that’s just how I felt while watching the show, you might have seen it in a different light than me.\\n\\nThe soundtrack for the show hands down deserves a Grammy.There was only one opening and I salute this show for not changing it to something crappy in between.The opening is without a doubt one of the best I have seen in the past year and it still stands out today among very stiff competition. It was very well animated and I also loved how the opening foreshadowed what will happen in the show without making it too obvious. The song Let Me Hear by Fear and Loathing Las Vegas really helps me get into the mood of the show. The song really gets me pumped for it and you just don’t skip this hella good opening. I mean you just can’t it’s that awesome.\\n\\nThe ending song comparatively is much calmer, which I guess the audience needs after an intense episode. The background music overall was really good and it really helped set the mood during some scenes. However, I wasn’t a huge fan of the use of dubstep of the show mainly because I hate dubstep, but hey that’s my opinion and for that reason I am not counting the dubstep as a flaw. The music that plays especially during the sad moments or the moments shared by Murano and Izumi truly stand out in numerous ways, like seriously I want this music to play when I die.\\n\\nThe show, I heard was more or less faithful to the manga and I am glad that Madhouse was able to pull off a good adaptation of the series. Then again, it’s not like we didn’t expect anything but greatness from Madhouse . The animation was really good if not great and the character designs were still very amazing, despite the fact they are a little outdated. The show overall had this dark and serious tone but when they had some comedy in there, they handled it very well. There wasn’t much comedy not that it needed more comedy but the scenes that were supposed to be hilarious really were very well executed.\\n\\nNow the ending of the show, in my opinion was amazing and it managed to bring a smile on my face. I basically wanted an ending like this and I am glad I got it. However, I am not sure if others would agree with me, but don’t worry the ending was nothing like the load of turd ‘Lost’ served us. The ending in my opinion didn’t ruin the series but in fact it managed to wrap everything up very well.\\n\\nNonetheless, the show did have several plotholes though as some things remained unresolved like where did the parasytes come from and yes we more or less get an understanding of why they arrived, but I really wanted to know since the beginning from where they originated or did someone create them? Also, another thing I am curious about is how Cana was able to sense the presence of Parasytes. I wish the show would have offered us an explanation to how she was able to have such psychic abilities. Okay the serial killer’s reason to have this ability makes sense, but what about Cana’s? Well actually the serial killer distinguishes based on people’s behavior whereas Cana on the other seemed to have some psychic abilities which never really got cleared up, which was really sad!\\n\\n Despite its flaws, Parasyte the Maxim is without one of the best series I have ever watched in recent times and it might just go down in anime history with the greats. I would highly recommend this show to those who love the sci-fi genre .',\n",
       "  'The one word I\\'d use to describe this series would definitely be \"escape\". Not necessarily from somewhere, it\\'s more about where you\\'re headed. Most people look past the true depth in this show due to all the slapstick jokes, and gimmicky humor, but there is some subtle beauty in this show that sits right under the surface. The premise of accepting who you truly are as an individual, and not letting social norms effect that idealistic image you strive for is the strongest driving theme throughout the show. Ok, so the story is fairly vague, not much actual \"plot\" apart from the initial incident of finding thisbridge community, and the various escapades within this curious place. But the show does make good work of making the best out of the small advances we see throughout the show.\\n\\nArt is very well done, the gradient art style is very appealing, and refreshing. Although you can say the actual character art feels a few years behind, I think it adds to the show as a whole, giving a different feel then more modern art gives off. Overall, I really did think the art was fairly strong throughout.\\n\\nThe sound is ok, not really that memorable apart form the ending song, which I happen to love. It really captures the fragile feel of the anime, and speaks more in emotions and feels than literal meaning. Take that how you want, it\\'s more of a hit or miss sort of thing.\\n\\nI\\'ve seen a lot of criticizing of the characters, especially considering new developments throughout the story. Don\\'t get me wrong, I do thing character development is very importnat in almost all animes, but I give a small exception to this show. The point is less on seeing these characters change, more so to understanding their past, and learn who they are. We get to peel back their obscure exteriors, and understand them in a strangely intimate way, getting a little slice of what makes them need this bizarre community so much.\\n\\nI really enjoyed this anime a lot. It\\'s one of the most refreshing shows in ages, especially considering how I\\'ve been putting off watching it for a good 6 months, I am glad I finally got around to it. I think that one of it\\'s major problems this show has are that people can\\'t get past all the slapstick to really soak up the real genius, and introspective beauty this show has to offer. It\\'s all right there, you just have to be willing to look for it just a little.\\n\\nExcuse any small mistakes throughout this review, I\\'m not too good at writing these sorts of things, and thank you if you bothered to read through the whole thing.',\n",
       "  'Grown up watching this epic anime. Dragon Ball at first seem a cut-throat battle of the warriors from cosmos working desperately on their martial arts skills to prove their superiority. But deep in it, lies some of the most important lessons you can learn as a human. Main character Goku faces warriors like Raditz, Vegeta, Freeza, Cell, Buu etc. You can easily see the increasing ability of these opponents. Each time he faces an opponent stronger than any of his previous opponents. He doesn\\'t get intimidated by this. Instead his incredible enthusiasm to fight with the best and pushing his limits in order to matchthe powerful opponent is remarkable.\\nAnd his top-notch skills doesn\\'t make him arrogant and keep him reachable to his friends and family.\\n\\nVegeta couldn\\'t get the fact that Goku despite being a low-class saiyan warrior, how could he surpass him. It teaches that no matter how much potential you have, you need to work hard to become the best. There are no such a thing like \"low-class\" or \"high-class\" warrior but just a strong will to work hard to become the best. It applies to humans like us too.\\n\\nVegeta at first seems a proud vain prince of the saiyans. His transformation from one of the ruthless villains to one of the heroes is extraordinary. But, what I admire most of him is one of his quality. He never give up on losing competition from his Kakarot. He thinks that he is the prince of the saiyans and getting the Super Saiyan status was his Birth-Right. But Goku surpassing him on every moment doesn\\'t discourage him. Instead he has a strong will to surpass Kakarot one day to prove himself the strongest saiyan warrior. This teaches us as humans that no matterhow strong our competition is, we should work on our strengths to improve ourselves. Competition is healthy if it improves one\\'s abilities. This quote by him portrays his strong will :-\\n\\n\"Fine, Kakarot, you are the mightiest Saiyan, I\\'ve admitted that much. At least for now. But don\\'t you dare think that this is over. I won\\'t let you keep me in second place forever, feeding on the scraps of your glory. I will surpass you, and even then I\\'ll keep pushing, I\\'ll surpass every single warrior in the Universe. I won\\'t stop until I\\'m the ultimate number one. \"\\n\\nThis shows the top-class competition to reach the top and respect for friendship. I wish I could have learn these qualities from Goku and Vegeta. Dragon Ball is simply one of the most motivational anime for me.',\n",
       "  \"Just from reading the synopsis and glancing over a few of the scores this anime received, I decided not to watch to it. One day I was in the mood for a romance and decided to check out Toradora! again, this time reading through several of the reviews. And, in all honesty, if I hadn't, I probably would have dropped the anime after the first few episodes. Yet, the promises that it would get a lot better by around episode six kept me watching. That, plus the fact that so many of the reviewers like it so much. It was also said to be similarto Lovely Complex, which it wasn't. At all. \\n\\nStory/Characters; \\n\\nIt goes like this: Meet cute, crazy stuff, they work together and develop a sort of abusive friendship, then a lot, lot, lot of crazy stuff happens, not just with the two main characters, but also with the majority of the supporting characters. This anime makes sure to focus on everyone in the anime -- and nobody in class 2-C seems to have a boring life. \\n\\nA lot of people seemed to rate this anime lower than they would have liked to due to predictability. If that is something that turns you off, then in my opinion, you should totally watch this anime. It was one of the least predictable animes I have ever watched. Sure, you think you know what is going to happen (and what obviously is supposed to happen) at the start, but then everything goes haywire and you are left with several different options. And all of them have a very, very likely chance of being correct. Until the very end, each option is given enough supporting evidence to be proven a valid guess. I promise you, it is very unlikely that you will know what will happen next in this story. If anything, you will be dying to know or pissed off because all of your assumptions were incorrect. \\n\\nNow, I didn't like the story of this anime so much. Although it seemed obvious that they will be happiest together, I feel like Taiga and Ryuuji are an odd couple. Taiga is pretty abusive towards Ryuuji throughout the show, and a lot of the time I felt like he deserved better. They are both pretty selfish characters in their own way, as well. I never felt like they really belonged together. They seemed to be perfect best friends for each other, but no more than that. While watching the show, I really did get the sense of a father/daughter relationship between them, instead of two classmates and peers. That didn't really appeal to me.\\n\\nMost romantic animes really let you see inside the characters' heads and into their hearts. This show doesn't do that. At the end, you will find that there is a lot that you didn't know about the characters -- things that could have completely changed your feelings about the show had they been introduced earlier. Instead of feeling like someone watching the lives of these characters play out before you, you almost just feel like an invisible person sitting in their classrooms and sometimes following the characters around. Like a stalker. Not a fan of the show, but a stalker. Although that does sound very nice, it does help you feel like you are a part of the characters' lives. You learn things just as slowly as any involved fellow classmate would. \\n\\nNow for a hardcore romance fan like myself, this story like may seem very tedious and hard to get through, for the romantic progression is very slow. It's there, but it is dragging along to the point where you may feel like skipping a few episodes in order to find out if the pace will ever speed up. I am here to tell you that it does. For about the last five or six episodes, it does. And what you get in those last episodes isn't really enough to endure for. For those who love humor, I didn't really feel like this show was great for that either. I didn't really find myself laughing a lot. Then again, that may just be because everything else is so consuming that I didn't really pay attention to any possible humor. \\n\\nNow, the characters in this show are pretty...amazing, to say the least. They all of have depth and each one could easily have at least a mediocre level anime set around them. Each character is very important to the show, as you will see if you watch it. They take up some screen time, but because of the time and effort put into their character development, that screen time is very enjoyable to watch. I was never frustrated when episodes focused on another character more often than Taiga and Ryuuji. Each character also has a nice air of mystery around them, which I feel added to the show's overall enjoyability.\\n\\nWhile many people say that this is one of the best animes that they have ever watched, I disagree. Surely it is memorable because of how original it is and because of the ending, but not because I was blown away by it. The ending wasn't enough to make up for the other 20 or so episodes. \\n\\nArt/Sound; \\n\\nThe art in Toradora! was pretty unique. It's memorable for being different, just like the rest of the show. The coloring is pretty arrogant, but very eye-catching. The action scenes are drawn very well, though. They were very good about keeping proportions throughout the show. Now, while things were accurate, all of the detail seemed to be focused on the eyes of the characters -- which were some of the best I have ever seen. Although at times the eyes just seemed to take over their entire face, I didn't find it to be too distracting. The facial expressions were amazing as well. You could really feel what the character's felt just by looking at their intense and masterfully drawn expressions. \\n\\nI did love the music for the anime, though. Both the EDs and the OPs were very nice. I believe that I will be listening to them for quite some time. I also really liked the fact that the voice actors sang the songs. It helped me really connect to the show. \\n\\nConclusion;\\n\\nI wouldn't recommend this to a friend, but I wouldn't tell them it would be a waste of their time to watch it if they felt like it. I don't feel like this anime held up to all the astounding reviews it had, but it also didn't hold up for all the weak points other reviewers suggested, in my mind. It is a very memorable show, but only because it is different and what you think will happen doesn't really happens -- this show really manages to shock you very frequently. This show is a lot more about friendship than it is about romance, in my opinion. \\n\\nShould I watch it?;\\n\\nIf you are in the mood for a dramatic romance, or a hysterical romantic comedy, that has a predictable plot line and focuses on the ups and downs of one relationship and lets you see into the hearts of the characters -- a show that talks about how high school life fits into a romance, one that has a nice shoujo art style and really helps you feel for the characters, I suggest you find something else. On the other hand, if you want to watch a nice coming-of-age story, one that deals with friendship a lot more than it does romance, one that focuses on the difficulties of finding and accepting yourself while still pleasing others, and is about finding those that mean a lot to you and filling a void in your life -- one that has a not-so-normal couple and a lot of love possibilities (and a lot of possibility in general), one that gives each character a lot of depth, mystery, and some adequate screen time, and one that makes you feel like a part of the story and is a pretty memorable tale, then this is for you.\",\n",
       "  \"When I went into Mob Psycho 100, the only thing I tried to expect was that I'd be watching a good comedy series paired with good action. We all know that One is a competent writer, but I decided that comparing this series' quality to One Punch Man would most likely be unfair. Little did I realize that this series would not only match the quality of One Punch Man, but add the things I felt were missing in it. Now even though I didn't want to compare this series to One Punch Man, I'll be doing a fair bit of that inthis review, because I know anybody checking this review will be curious how it looks next to it. \\n\\n  One obviously made the decision when writing Mob Psycho 100 to have this series take itself a little more seriously. Because of this, I feel the characters are a lot more fleshed out than One Punch Man. We have serious character building arcs in this series, something I didn't expect in the slightest. Another refreshing thing is that (in my opinion) Shigeo isn't much like Saitama. Sure, he's overpowered, but he doesn't have much of Saitama's irreverence. Despite the series revolvling around Shigeo being emotionless, I feel he cares quite a bit. But this series doesn't just focus on him. For the most part, the entire cast gets some time to shine. Aside from Shigeo, the characters I feel stood out the most are Reigen, Ritsu, and Hanazawa. This series is not lacking at all in the character department. \\n\\n The artstyle to me came off like a mix of One Punch Man, and an adult swim late-night cartoon. It was trippy in all the right ways at times, and it's animation style lended itself to some great matches. The characters may not be as sharp looking as a series from Trigger or Gainax, but I feel I enjoy One's style just as much as those studios. It's also very consistent. I can't recall anytime I thought the animation looked poor. I think because they went with the exact style the manga must have, it made that very easy to accomplish. It's only flashy when it needs to be.\\n\\n The storyline among other things is about our protagonist's emotions and how much he conceals his powers. It's hard to describe it in depth without spoiling, but I can say they accomplish what they were going for very well. \\n\\n I believe that Mob Psycho 100 is the greatest anime of 2016. Not only did (in my opinion) it surpass One Punch Man in quality, but it also surpassed many of the series that I didn't think would be topped this year. I like this series so much in fact, it's surpassed many of my long time favorite series, and is currently number one on my profile. I can't give Mob Psycho 100 anything but a strong 10.\",\n",
       "  'Beautiful! That word summarizes my impression regarding Makoto Shinkai’s latest film. Honestly, I’m not that familiar with his films except for 5 cm per second. Of course, made by one person, there’s a lot of similarities here and there but all I can say is I prefer this one. Unlike 5 cm per second which gave me a lot of headaches (not in a horrible way), this show is so relaxing. I was not bored, which at first I thought I would. This show is all about a young guy who meets an older woman during one rainy day. Both are not able to move forwardin life and they find peace with each other’s company. Takao, the guy, is always on his own little world. He dreams of becoming a shoemaker but is not confident with his skills. Yukino, the girl, is traumatized by her awful experience at work, which made those around her, even her boyfriend, turn their back on her.\\n\\nThe story is rather simple; what made it so beautiful is that it takes the love story of Takao and Yukino in a subtle and heartwarming way. I haven’t seen this kind of romance for a while now. I’ve been reading too much romance manga (and you know the drill) and watching shoujo and harem anime that it’s so refreshing to find this kind of love story. Their relationship and feelings for each other developed nicely and naturally. With its stunning visuals and well-written script, it makes use of the “show don’t tell” method very effectively.\\n\\nIt still has the chance to tackle and deal with the concept deeper but Shinkai chooses not to. I’m satisfied with the end result. The characters are developed, in a 46-minute film, and it deals with the main problem heads on.\\n\\nI love drama. I love it when the characters are yelling to each other and crying until their eyes are swollen. I love it the most when a show can make me cry- or much better, sob. The last part of the movie, the stairs scene, makes me so sad and happy at the same time. Yeah, I admit, I cried for a bit. I love drama after all.\\n\\nThe highlight of this movie, aside from the story, is its stunning visuals. I’m a sucker for good art and animation so this film is so for me. With this alone, I could give this show a very high score in MAL. The animation is flawless and the background and sceneries are so detailed. It’s so refreshing and relaxing to eyes. Also, I’ve never seen so much rain in an anime before and A Garden of Words makes use of them a lot. It’s indeed a visual spectacle.\\n\\nThe soundtrack is also very plausible. The piano piece that’s being played throughout the movie helps a lot in building up the atmosphere. The voice actors done a very good job that the emotions flowed so naturally through their voices. Anyway, I love the ending song – Rain.  After reading the translated version of the song, I discovered how perfect it is for our main characters. I’m LSS to that song right now.\\n\\nI’m not going to say that this movie is a masterpiece or the best thing I’ve ever seen but it’s close. This film has definitely gained its right spot in my heart. It ends in a vague way, but I still consider it a happy ending. Both are able to move forward in life so I strongly believe that one day, they will be together again… in one rainy day.',\n",

       "  'So, Mahou Shoujo animes are for little girls right? Hmm. How to put it. Neil Patrick Harris is gay by formality and title, but in actuality, he is probably one of the most awesome person to walk this Earth. Madoka Magica is pretty...gay.. by title, but in actuality it is probably one of the most awesome anime to have been aired. STORY: Complete troll on the producer\\'s part, this was actually advertised as a slice of life show....it\\'s not....The show starts off with a normal school girl going to school (obviously) and having cute and moe fun with her friends, and by all means, thefirst two episodes can be categorized as a slice of life. But...when it hits the third episode...it basically makes you want to play Russian roulette with 6 bullets, crap your pants with rainbows, throw up your dinner, give you a lust for unicorn tears, while crying blood and eating your socks. Yes. Quite a mess of emotions to say the least. I will not say anything about the plot in detail from here because everything and anything will be a massive spoiler, but just be warned that you will be absolutely sh!t-faced after watching this show. It triggers painful emotions, with this extremely dark and depressing yet heartwarming story. The tags are there for a reason. The story wastes no time at all and in just 12 episodes it creates one of the most memorable story in your anime watching history. It revolves around hatred, jealousy, greed and everything in between, but mainly friendship and, in my opinion more importantly, loneliness and despair and overcoming odds. I honestly cannot say anymore without spoiling anything, but trust me, psychological and horror in my opinion are the biggest categories i would put this show under.\\n\\nART: Now this one is also very troll-y. The characters are so damn moe its almost disgusting at what they have to go through in these 12 episodes. The animation is veeery unique with its moe style with a few cg effects, and a world that gives a vibe of being sketched with colored pencil. Its very pleasing. The quality therefore is top notch as to how it is pulled off. I\\'ve never watched a mahou shoujo, but battling is a part of them i\\'m pretty sure. And the battles, to be honest, (at least in this show) is very well dished out, and i can safely compare them to the scenes of typical, no, top-notch shounen animes. The only thing is...the style of the battles...i cannot explain it but, the battles give the vibe that the artists were very high on various drugs while creating the show (you can decide for yourself if i\\'m joking or not). But yes, it is in the end, a very unique art style that sticks with you at how ironic the cuteness is compared to story of the show. \\n\\nSOUND: To be honest, its not memorable and its not the best, but instead, its unique (as in on drugs unique) to match with the rather different art style. I can say that the sound is perfect for the show at how it blends in with the scenes. But there are one or two OSTs that are gut wrenchingly messed up at how much emotion it puts you through.\\n\\nCHARACTER: This is heavily character driven, and is focused on the hardships the character have to overcome (...do they overcome them?...watch and find out :D ) Like i said, the main focus of the story is the power of friendship, what loneliness will do to a person and what despair and pressure will make a person do. It also deals with the concept of \"Be careful of what you wish for\" because what you get in return may not be what you want, or there are unexpected and horrible consequences. Every character....grows..? Yes, they do, however, growing isn\\'t always positive, as someone can grow and mature in the wrong direction and Madoka Magica deals with this idea VERY. THOROUGHLY. \\n\\nENJOYMENT: The first two episodes are slow and to be honest you might be thinking why the hell am i watching this, but, this is necessary to set up the plot and themes. These two episodes are a waste, but that is exactly why this shows needs it. And then comes the infamous THIRD EPISODE. You will be very surprised in both a good and bad way at the way the show goes about. Episode 4-10 will make you want more and more after each consecutive episode as the story gets deeper and darker, but at the same time, somewhat brighter. In the final two episodes, i must say, it is, out of all the animes i have watched ( i have watched much more than i have on my MAL list, just too lazy to post them up), i experienced some of the most powerful emotional rollercoasters. The conclusion is epic and you will not regret watching it. I suggest that you do not finish this in one sitting, however tempting it may be, otherwise your brain will turn into a mushy grey matter like mine and leak out of your ear because of the beating it took. \\n\\nOVERALL: Amazing. This was my first mahou shoujo and it was recommended to me by a friend who told me how it will be the most f***ed up thing i will ever watch. It was pretty close, i think School Days still wins in this situation :P though. The morals that are presented are so good (i won\\'t write them because they may be a bit spoilery) and the way the characters deal with them are both heartwarming and spirit breaking.  Nothing is perfect though, and the one \"flaw\" i would say is that, this is, in essence, a mahou shoujo, and it does get a bit sappy and girly, but that is the show, and i would like to think that it adds to the show. But it is in no way a true hinderence to the show. \\n\\nIs this a watch? Um, do you like anime? Yes you should f***ing watch it why are you even still reading this review?',\n",
       "  \"Whenever I state my opinion about a show that is immensely popular, I often don’t use the term “overrated”. The reason for this is because when people use the word, they often mean “you like a show I hate”. The times when I use that term, I try to make sure that it’s understood as “the show is getting more credit than it deserves”. Not only when it comes to bad shows, but also those that are good and worth your time. If anything is treated as a masterpiece when it’s not close to it, overrated is the word of the day. In my reviewof the most talked and viewed anime of 2012, that word is the short version of my feelings for this show.    \\n\\nSword Art Online (a.k.a SAO) is an anime adaptation of a Light Novel with the same name that was released in 2009. The author of the novel is Kawahara Reki, who is also known for writing Accel World, another popular novel that received an anime adaptation earlier than SAO. Judging from works, Kawahara always use games as the center subject of his stories.  \\n\\nThe anime itself is directed by Itou Tomohiko and the studio behind the show is A-1 Pictures, known for other well-known adaptations such as Kuroshitsuji, Fairy Tail and Ao no Exorcist. While I’m not familiar with most of their works, it quite safe to assume the show is in decent hands. \\n\\nLet me get one thing straight. I’ve played a few MMO’s in my younger days and currently play sometimes when I’m bored (And the last MMO I played was in 2011). In all of them, I was like Kirito, a Solo Player. I rarely teamed up with a guild, joined a party or talked to anyone (Mostly because players prefer the internet language, which I don’t understand very well). The only difference between me and him is that I was never among the best. The highest level I achieved in an MMO is level 40, while Kirito have top marks like it’s genetic. MMO games are a lackluster to me now due to the amount of hours spent on just leveling up and boring questing. \\n\\nHowever, I was drawn back to that world when I watched my first episode in a small anime convention that showed the first four episodes. I was enjoying it and it was something I’ve never experienced (I have not seen .hack). I decided to take a dive into this new world and returned to the surface with something to share the world with.  \\n\\n\\nPLOT:\\n\\nMy reason for watching it in the first place was because of the concept. When I found out that the story was “A virtual reality game turned into a real life death game”, it caught my interest. Not only that, but the world was solely created to satisfy a sadistic scientist who wanted to play god for real (That was my impression of the introduction). The first episode game me a good impression and a determination to see more of the show. From that point forward, I was really enjoying myself.\\n\\nBut that did not last. It has been discussed by hardcore and casual fans alike where the story started to fall. The most common one is episode 3 to episode 7, because those stories were side stories in the original light novel series. If it’s true or not matters little, since the main storyline isn’t any better. If the side stories were hated for being about random sh*t, then the main one does not deserve more praise. To me, both the filler and the main story are equally as bad that I almost thought they were the same thing. And when things get a bit more exciting after a mini story with little purpose was done, the story decided to end there. How things turned out was a bit unexpected, but it felt forced at the same time. It was like the writer was in a hurry. If the original story was longer, I might’ve not criticize it as much as I did now. \\n\\nWhat made it somewhat worse was that the second half of the story focuses on an entirely different plot and concept. The appeal of the original concept was lost when the story decided to be about something else and forget why many viewers started watching it in the first place. This would’ve worked better if it was a sequel to the story (like a second season) instead of being a part of the same season. That’s the ALO arc for you.  \\n\\nBut the reason why the story fails to become what many wanted to see was because of how messy and poor the execution is. The amount of time skips, side stories and how short the main story was proved that the writing of the story is in fact quite bad. I learned from classes about movies that a story has a specific structure to work. While I will not go into detail due to the fact it takes forever, I’ll just say that SAO follows that structure poorly. It’s like it’s missing a pillar somewhere around the end. \\n\\nPersonally, I loathed the cheap drama and the Deus ex Machina. The drama was so laughably predictable in a narrative sense I felt unmoved, even when the story gave me its saddest scene. The Deus ex Machina was used so often that it made me think that the creator ran on limited imagination when this was made.\\n \\nAnd of course, my number one question was unanswered through the entire series. I assume you all know, but if you don’t, I’ll just say “f*cking Kayaba”.          \\n\\n\\nCHARACTERS:\\n\\nBelieve it or not, the true reason why Sword Art Online falls flat for me is the characters we have followed through the whole story. Within the community, there are a fair amount of love and hate for them. Or to be correct, there are a fair amount of love and hate for Kirito or Asuna, because nobody cares about the rest. What there is to know is that SAO have quite a share amount of characters, and since the game is focused on an MMO game and not an RPG, it’s only natural that there are so many people to know about. Sadly, this anime does not succeed to get a high score in the character section.\\n\\nLet’s start with our lead characters:\\n\\nKirito (a.k.a Kirigaya Kazuto), the main protagonist is described as an average kid with socialization problems, except that is not true. While it is shown, it’s only portrayed when secondary character Klein is shown. To everyone else, he has no problem at all. That is beside the point, however. In the anime community, he is either a lovable badass or a hated Gary Stu. But what’s problematic about him is not only because he’s a perfect hero, but his character in general. Besides the fact he is designed like every other generic harem male lead, Kirito’s reason for hitting the trash can is because he has no true identity. \\n\\nHis entire personality is based depending on what scene is being played. If the scene requires him to be stupid, he is stupid. If it requires him to be smart, he is smart. If he needs to be a badass, he is badass. The idea is that there is nothing about Kirito that identifies him, at least not as an individual. This could also be because of how he is portrayed as some boys want to be and becomes a wish-fulfillment type of character. All the character traits that are given to him are what defies a guy as perfect and at the same time, deny him any other traits. This doesn’t give him a strong character identity, but it rather makes him a prime example of a Gary Stu character. In other words, his character is so scattered and unbalanced that I can’t even call him a character of a story, but rather a visual novel protagonist with a voice and eyes.  \\n\\n\\nAsuna, the main heroine shares the same problem, but on a different scale. While Kirito has little character to speak of, Asuna has too much of it to have an identity. When we first saw her, she was a quiet and mysterious person in the corner who rarely speaks till her face was shown. Next time she appeared, she was a tough leader with a cold personality. Next time, she became a Tsundere. After that, she was a scary lady. And after the event that… screw it, you know what I’m talking about. The distinctiveness of Asuna does not exist.\\n\\nEvery personality she uses is just different fetishes for the general otaku community to obsess over. And it works, because there are a f***ton of fans that adore her. Because of her multiple of personalities, I don’t even know what part of her makes her so appealing to others. Not only in the real world, but in-universe, everyone seems to be after her butt. In SAO, she is more of a prize than an ally to her guild, and Kirito fights them to claim said price. Her character becomes less chaotic later in the series, but then she is just and only the main love interest that relies on Kirito all the time and it pisses me off.   \\n  \\nNow, if the fans of her comes to my door and points out that she can kick ass, I simply reply “Bullsh*t”. While she can pack quite a punch and is one of the most powerful players in the game, she never had a moment to shine. When an important fight is on screen, she is either a decoy, a distraction, a helpless damsel or a meat shield. Not only that, but Kirito takes all the credit in every fight, making her more of a motivation pet rather than a fellow comrade in arms. It’s quite clear she is only a fighter because it attracts more attention and making her more appealing to female viewers (which doesn’t always work). The fact that a female character can fight doesn’t automatically make her a good character.  \\n \\n\\nOh, I hear “what about Suguha?” in the background, but I’ll keep it short. I’ll be honest and say I was interested in her when she appeared. I did not expect a good character since the ones before didn’t do their job, but her relationship with Kirito in the real world made me hope for something I’ve not seen in anime for so long: a brother and sister relationship with no incest. But of course, I got slapped in the face by the show and it laughed it’s a** off when my hopes were broken. It was nice to focus on someone else than just the “Twilight v2” couple, but she didn’t create a strong impression and felt like just another collection of Kirito’s harem. The only point I give her is that she tried to stay away from him because they were siblings, but adding incest at all still did not change my everlasting hate for its enormous presence in modern anime. Yes, I know they are in reality cousins, but we all know it’s just an excuse to get away with it.  \\n\\n\\nBut aren’t there more characters? There are, but they are so irrelevant to the story that might as well be replaced by rocks and it wouldn’t make much difference. The Sword Art Online icon that is used on this site would give you the idea that the story focused around these people, but the truth is that only Kirito and Asuna matter at all. Every other character appears briefly and sometimes only show up in one episode before disappearing. Next time they appear, a minute cameo is all they can achieve. There are also those whose only purpose is to die, and it becomes so obvious in time that it’s not even funny. It’s a shame, because I wanted to see more of the side characters and learn a bit more of them. However, it felt like the series resented me for it and told me to focus only on the main characters (which I genuinely disliked). It was very frustrating, since I’ve always have hated that type of character treatment.\\n\\n\\nANIMATION:\\n\\nUnlike how I criticized the two catagories above, I can honestly say that the animation is quite good. While not so amazing that you get eyegasm by just looking at it, it’s above average and can be called stunning, if you willing to give it that much credit. When action is used, the movement is quite fluid and action packed, making these moments never boring and suspenseful. The usage of CGI is also quite well done and is used in a way that it blends in with the environment. This is mostly helped because the setting is a game, but it feels like a part of the game when it’s used. Even CGI haters can’t really criticize its existence. The background and setting material aren’t as impressive, however, but it’s quite safe to say it’s good enough. While it cannot hope to be compared with Ufotable quality, it at least above something completely unimpressive like Naruto. \\n\\nOne thing that the animation can be criticized for is its habit of using shots that has no movement. It’s mostly used during large crowd sequences, which is somewhat understandable. It’s not the first anime to use them and it’s not a prime example of an anime that uses it all the time, but it’s something to think about.\\n\\nOh wait. There is also a bit a fanservice as well, and anybody that knows me knows that I loathe anime that takes that route. However, it does not appear so much or get in the way when something serious is happening, unlike something that uses it so much that it’s annoying like High School of the f*cking Dead.                   \\n\\n\\nSOUNDTRACK:\\n\\nOne thing I cannot badmouth about is the music of the show. In the anime community, just knowing that Kajiura Yuki is doing the music automatically means win. I can’t blame them, because her work in one of my favorite shows of all time still impresses me to this day. Unfortunately, even she can't save the show. While the soundtrack was very good, it was not her best work. Many are forgotten and I only remember a few, and it’s mostly because they were repetitive. Still, the songs did fit the scenes when it was used and were quite pleasant to listen to. This is not Kara no Kyoukai or Fate/Zero material, but it’s good enough to stand on its own.\\n\\nThe opening and endings did not however do as great. All four were quite generic and obvious for a title like Sword Art Online, but they aren’t obnoxious in any way. They in fact are quite fine. Personally, I found Opening 1: Crossing fields quite catchy, despite how average it is. So I can’t say anything really negative about the songs that were picked for this anime.\\n\\n\\nFINAL VERDICT: \\n\\nThe only way I can describe SAO in no more than five words is that it’s bad, but looks pretty. Not all of it was dreadful and some episodes were quite good, but when looking at the larger picture, I can’t accept its popularity or love that has been given to it. It might look good, but the things that keep a show together (Story and Characters) can only be described as awful.\\n\\nStory: 5 \\nCharacters: 3 \\nAnimation: 7 \\nSoundtrack:  8\\nEnjoyment: 5\\nOverall: 5  \\n\\nHowever, I will not discourage and tell you to not watch this anime, despite my low rating of it. It still quite possible to enjoy this series if are looking to watch something simple and average. Just don’t expect the next big thing or anything amazing. This is not for those who want something thought provoking or something original. And if we are going to question its popularity, let’s just say it was luckier than better titles of 2012.  \\n\\nNow that I think about it, Sword Art Online works perfectly as a visual novel. It already has a generic protagonist and a harem of all type of girls involved. In fact, I’ve heard that the game “Sword Art Online: Infinity Moment” is just a dating sim game with gameplay. Are you guys sure this story was meant for a Light Novel?\",\n",
       "  \"Baccano! Review or This Reviewer Embraces the Fact that there is no Main Character Baccano! is a show which has taken parts of the anime community by storm, while simultaneously remaining relatively unknown to the larger whole. The series is frenetic and has more energy than perhaps any other anime. Each scene, while displayed with no heed for chronology, is nonetheless structured to introduce questions and answer them little by little, even if the answer is chronologically first. This is an interesting and ingenious structural choice, and also is in many ways responsible for the series' undeniable style. Baccano! does a good job of offering alittle something for most everybody, without watering any of it down.\\n\\nBaccano! is a show that defies description. Generally speaking, it's about a number of people and a spattering of events which are connected, sometimes loosely and sometimes directly. More specifically, it is itself a story about these things and about stories in general. It, in some ways, comes close to breaking the fourth wall with its acknowledgment of the place of human subjectivity in any story. The framing of the series with the exchanges between Carole and the Vice-Director put the entire show in this context, and the re-telling of specific events from multiple perspectives provide examples as basis for the overall framework.\\n\\nBaccano!'s placement in the American prohibition era and embracing of this setting lends it a taste of the exotic. Even to American audiences, a unique take on the prohibition era such as this one seems foreign and wild, despite the familiarity of many of the places represented. Anyone who has ever seen a mafia movie feels at home, and yet at the same time it is made foreign to us. Unlike many other series which utilize a unique setting or particular aesthetic, Baccano!'s use of its setting, its powerful aesthetic, does not come off as heavy-handed. Baccano! oozes style without ever feeling the need to shove it in your face, allowing for someone to not connect with the aesthetic yet still enjoy the series overall. \\n\\nThe animation in Baccano! is definitely a strong point, even though it is a little rough around the edges. Stationary art in the series is certainly good, but nothing especially worth noting. In motion, though, the style of the series comes to realization with its somewhat flashy, rough animation style. Colors are bright and vibrant, matching the characters' flair and the feel of the setting. Despite some remarkably over the top designs, everything meshes very well within the series, and there is nothing which visually feels out of place, even the occasional CGI section.\\n\\nSound plays a unique role in Baccano! in reinforcing and bringing to life its setting. In this, through the use of primarily jazz and swing tracks with unique twists, the soundtrack is remarkably successful, lending a credibility to the endeavor without being vestigial or overbearing. The soundtrack is solid even without considering the above, and is definitely good enough to warrant listening to on its own. Within the series, it never really takes center stage&amp;mdash;aside from the dramatic string piece that closes each episode&amp;mdash;but instead achieves a healthy balance with the other aspects of the show, unlike many series with strong, aesthetically-driven soundtracks, such as Cowboy Bebop or Samurai Champloo. While not as strong on its own as those two, it does a better job of navigating its place within the overall work.\\n\\nThe voice-acting in Baccano! is unique in the anime world. It features few, if any, big name seiyuu, and, possibly as a result, is superbly cast. It is common for big name seiyuu to be included in a project for publicity and increased viewership, even where their voice does not fit the character, or where the show must be altered to accommodate the actor. In Baccano!, though, each voice actor fits their character extraordinarily well, and their performances overall are definitely solid, naturally bolstered by clever writing and a supporting soundtrack. As far as stand out performances, I must point out the seiyuu of Isaac and Miria, who managed to make what could have been very irritating characters enjoyable and fantastically entertaining. Ladd Russo's voice actor is also remarkably good, making a character who sounded simple and uninspired in description great in practice. As far as main characters are concerned, it is difficult to pinpoint a weak link, and the supporting cast is solid, if not as exemplary.\\n\\nIt is difficult to speak much on that plot of Baccano! without spoiling the mystery and the fun of it all, so I'll be brief and general. Baccano!'s plot is an evolving mystery which fills out completely the 13 episodes it inhabits. There is no idle time in Baccano!, and each scene fits very well into an overall picture. While this frenetic pace is paramount to the impressiveness of the series and to further its very postmodern style, at times it can be somewhat jarring. This, of course, is most likely intentional, considering the mindset of the rest of the series, but it does irk some, especially those less interested or familiar with postmodern literature. The plot itself is fairly straightforward if laid out chronologically, but the way it is presented makes it somewhat extraordinary. It does a better job of engaging the viewer in the plot, making them an active participant, than perhaps any other series I have seen. \\n\\nIf I had to point out a primary flaw of Baccano!, it would be the voluminous cast which limits the characterization of each. Each character is a larger than life, highly-stylized figure, but as a general rule there is little more to them than that. There is some nuance to each, but it is only in the relationships between the characters that they achieve depth, keeping this from becoming a crippling weakness. Even so, the aesthetically-charged character design is worth noting, differentiating each character powerfully from the others even in keeping with period attire&amp;mdash;or at least a stylized, egalitarian version of it.\\n\\nBaccano! takes everything you know about anime and shows you that there is another way, all the while engaging you with a flashy mystery full of action and suspense. Flush with style and ripe with content, Baccano! manages to give the audience a little bit of everything, without feeling rushed or particularly shallow, although its biggest weakness is the lack of complexity in its characters and plot. It offers unforgettable characters, powerful aesthetics, and a great soundtrack to frame a frenetic narrative which challenges notions of narratives themselves. The series challenges you as a viewer, interpreter, and active participant. \\n\\nFinal Score: 9/10\",\n",
       "  \"What can I say? People are calling this the greatest anime of all time. If you want to call yourself an anime fan, you should know it. The greatest thing about this series is that everybody has their own unique interpretation of it. The reason why I gave the animation a 9 is that, during the time the show was being made - especially near the end - Gainax wasn't really confident in the show's potential for success (at the time it was being aired on TV Tokyo, which had 5 affiliates, and only became successful after word of mouth hadspread rumor of the show all over the place and a larger broadcast network decided to pick it up... or something like that) and so they cut both the budget and scheduling for the Eva project, so later in the series, the animators didn't have time to make as many frames as they would have liked, and eventually they ran out of time to complete all the frames they needed, so in the last 2 next episode previews and even the last episode, they had to use macro shots of storyboards and the like.  You'll be so wrapped up in the show at this point that you'll probably think it was intentional.  Original and intriguing characterization is one of the strongest points of the show.  The story is compelling.  There is some interesting use of music in some parts of the show.  Most likely, Eva will either send you on a trip or throw you for a loop.  It'll put your brain in a blender and kinda rearrange it a little bit.  If you just finished watching something like FLCL, I suggest putting this one off for a while.  Go watch Gundam or something.  Come back after that.\",\n",
       "  'Clannad ~After Story~ Review FIRST: Do NOT watch this show or read my review without first watching season one of Clannad. Although it isn\\'t \"necessary,\" watching season one and experiencing the character development throughout it greatly helps you understand the story and value the characters. Plus, it was a pretty damn good show. Story-10: Really, the first 8 episodes of After Story are pretty much exactly like what the original Clannad series was like: school life and character arcs while slowly building up Nagisa and Tomoya\\'s relationship. Although these arcs were well written and I enjoyed them thouroughly, they weren\\'t deserving of a 10 rating. However, once youget past the great, but not truly spectacular first 8 eps, the show starts to focus solely on Tomoya and Nagisa. This is where the magic happens and the show began to become my favorite of all time. I was impressed that Clannad managed to make me cry during Fuko\\'s arc (last time I cried was when my grandfather died a few years ago, and that was only a couple tears). But then in the homestretch of Clannad ~After Story~ I found myself bawling my eyes out on numerous occasions. The best word to describe this series is an emotional rollercoaster. It will having you laughing your ass off one minute, and crying like a baby the next. The writing in this anime is unbelievable and it\\'s like the writers developed the perfect bow to pull on your heart strings, timing each event perfectly. The ending is controversial, but I personally loved it.\\n\\nArt-8:\\nThe art in After Story is beautiful. The settings are all beautiful, characters look great, and colors are vibrant. However, it is not up to par with some other, more recent, anime I have seen. If I were to review this back when it first came out, the art would get probably a 9, but with anime becoming more visually impressive each year, I just can\\'t say it\\'s distinctively good. It certainly is great though, and besides the fact that many of the characters don\\'t seem to age physically even thou they are old (look the the furikawa family...), there is nothing to complain about.\\n\\nSound-10:\\nI\\'m reviewing the dubbed version if anyone is wondering. I found the voice acting to be superb, and can\\'t find any week links in the cast. But what really makes the sound of this anime spectacular is the soundtrack. My only complaint is with the Ed \"Torch\" although it isn\\'t a bad song, it is very upbeat and poppy, thus can easily kill the mood of the more serious episodes if you don\\'t pause the show before the song starts. Overall, most of the tracks used in Clannad are reused in After Story. All the music is perfectly placed with each scene, and i never found myself annoyed with the song choices. Each track helps establish the setting and mood of the scene. By now, everyone should be familiar with the dango song, and thus Nagisas theme. The melody to those songs was stuck in my head since season one. I found it to be a really cute and catchy song. But after watching After Story, I can\\'t help but feel emotional whenever I hear it. The melody is rearranged multiple times to make different variations of the song that fit their specific scenes perfectly. Really, if the only songs in the ost were rearrangements of Nagisas theme, I would still probably give the soundtrack an 8. It really is quite like the series as a whole, sometimes listening to it will make you smile, but other times it may make you tear up a bit. Other highlights are Roaring Tides, The Place Where Wishes Come True, Toki o Kizamu Uta, and Fantasy.\\n\\nCharacter-10:\\nTHE reason why this show is so great. Each character is unique, and although their arcs can sometimes fall into a cliche, the writing still keeps you caring about them. The character development of Tomoya is really the most intriguing aspect. How he deals with all the joys and hardships of life really makes you think about yourself as a person. Where Tomoya was a funny delinquent in Clannad, in After Story you see him mature into an adult, albeit, an adult with a cursed life. I have never been a sucker for romance, but Tomoya and Nagisa\\'s relationship is unlike any I\\'ve ever seen. The writers did a brilliant job of making you fall in love with the characters, and feel their emotions as they experience them. I know that what I just wrote isnt very convincing, but that\\'s because I honestly can\\'t explain how this show makes you feel for the lead characters because it is unlike anything I have ever experienced.\\n\\nEnjoyment-10:\\nThe show made me laugh until my stomach hurt on numerous occasions. It later would flip my stomach upside down and make me depressed as I cried my eyes out. The few plot twists this show has hit you hard (I was spoiled for one of the key events already, and it still left me shocked when it happened). Btw, for your own good: DO NOT GOOGLE ANYTHING ON CLANNAD WHILE WATCHING THIS SHOW. Seriously, just typing in a characters name and looking at the suggestions on google or youtube can spoil major plot events. So now you have been warned. Anyways, this anime is the first to make me actually think about myself as a person, and my future life. The emotional ride the show takes you on is one you will never forget.\\n\\nOverall:\\nWatch this show. If you haven\\'t already, watch Clannad before Clannad ~After Story~. In short, the emotions this show makes you feel are what set it apart from everything else. This show really can\\'t be described in any other way than by watching it. If you don\\'t think you can handle the emotions that come with this show, do not watch it. But if your someone who thinks anime is meant for action , and not something that can make you laugh, cry, and reflect on your own life, then watch this show, and see your perspective change completely. I have never seen anything like Clannad and After Story, and don\\'t expect to ever again.\\n\\nThe Verdict:\\n\\nAn experience unlike anything I\\'ve ever seen. An emotional rollercoaster like no other.\\n\\nPros:\\n+ Toying with your emotions\\n+ Excellent character development\\n+ Beautiful story\\n+ Music is fantastic\\n+ So much crying...\\n+ Everything else\\n\\nCons:\\n- Torch can really kill the mood\\n- Not enough cons for me to write about\\n\\nIf you liked Clannad, watch...\\nKanon/Air/Angel Beats:\\nAnything by Jun Maeda belongs here because they are so emotional and high in the drama department. Although none of these shows are as good as Clannad, they all do have similar feels and are all good in their own right.\\nef-Tale of Memories:\\nDrama filled sadness.\\n\\n10/10 - Masterpiece',\n",
       "  'JoJo is one of those generic anime-- \"Well, I let you know that before your Naruto, Fairy Tail  came in, we had JoJo. JoJo is the root of all Shonen (Now Seinen).\" Well... Umm... Okay. The show is indeed Bizarre so even though it had its generic moments it\\'s fine, but there are things that I dislike about this show. STORY: If you\\'re still clueless about the story, we follow this guy named JoJo and we follow him through his bizarre adventures. For more information, read the synopsis. written by MAL. If you love Shonen anime, you\\'ll get easily hook by the show, which Idid got hook. This season didn\\'t answer a lot of questions from its plot, but hey, we already got Stardust Crusaders and Diamond is Unbreakable (Which I\\'ll watch soon). \\n\\nHowever, the story\\'s biggest downfall is its pacing. The first part (first half) of JoJo has a very fast pacing. They didn\\'t took time developing Erina and JoJo and they didn\\'t took time on JoJo\\'s training with the two characters at the second half which I even forgot their names because they\\'re forgettable.\\n\\nFast-pacing leads to forgettable...\\n\\nCHARACTERS:\\nNot the main characters of course. The JoJo(s. Let\\'s leave that letter there.) aren\\'t forgettable. However, this anime doesn\\'t really take time to develop some of its minor characters because of its horrible pacing.\\n\\nDespite some forgettable characters, JoJo, JoJo, and the villains of this show are actually entertaining to watch despite the show being kind of generic. I guess it\\'s generic, because it is bizarre. We\\'ll get onto that part later.\\n\\nAnimation and Sound:\\nThe colors and shadings of this show is really impressive and I like how it switches its colors on moments that are intense and bizarre. Though, the animation doesn\\'t really have smooth or \"sakuga\" moments unlike other action shows that I\\'ve watch. For the soundtrack, it\\'s something that I have to get used to. I didn\\'t really get in with its OP themes, but they actually get catchy once you listen to them all over again. For the OSTs, there are good ones, but then there are okay ones.\\n\\nOVERALL:\\nI did say that it shows some generic moments, but what makes this different from other shows is that this show is aware of its generic moments because heck, it is bizarre. However, what turns me off is its fast-pacing story (at some parts) and some of its minor characters are completely forgettable. The show didn\\'t really do a good job on making them shine.\\n\\nI heard Stardust Crusaders is good, so I hope that lives up to the hype as I\\'m going to watch it soon.\\n\\nScore: 6/10',\n",
       "  \"This anime has it all... action ,romance,comedy and a good story to boot. And what they've done well with the anime is that they haven't blown it out of proportions... it has the right mix of everything , in my view, and it's score is way too low for the anime's standards. STORY(10)- The story as i said is a pretty good one. A group of assassins fighting against unjust rule,.. ya , you might say it's kinda old-school, but its presented to absolute perfection. If anything you might feel a bit downwhen the characters you like die, but without that , in my opinion the story would have been a bit unrealistic. You dont come out of a war without a single casualty.\\n\\nArt and sound  (10 &amp; 9)- \\n                                         The art in this anime is really good and the sound just backs it up. I don't know about the japanese version(I saw the english dub) but the english dub artists have done a really great job, i especially liked Leone's sound, she would'nt have been the same with out it.\\n\\nCharacter( 10 )-\\n                           There's actually pretty good character development in this anime, considering the screen time the characters have, you'll come to really love most of the characters and you'll definitely shed a tear or two if they end up dying. The romance is the only one which one could say , they could have worked on a bit, it felt a bit too rushed and thus didnt come out as good as it could have, but hey it turns out pretty good in the end.\\n\\nOverall Enjoyment(10)-\\n                                      I thoroughly enjoyed this anime and is one of my all time favorites. I'd recommend this to every one!!\\n\\nHope you liked this short review and found it helpful ;)\"]}"

And at the center of this mess is Jack Black, whose over-the-top shtick as Steve feels less like a character and more like a bloated, annoying caricature of himself phoning it in with the energy **** who ate too many pork chops and forgot what made his Bowser a good character.Where Super Mario delivered a tight, colorful romp with a villain you couldn't help but like to hate, Minecraft stumbles through a plot so thin it could've been scribbled on a 3x5 card with a fat sharpie. The live action gimmick is a disaster with corpulent Jack Black waddling around in a turquoise shirt against a green screen looks less like an adventure and more like a sad clown act at a kid's party no one showed up to. His constant mugging and forced musical numbers grate on the nerves, turning Steve into a flabby, loud distraction instead of the everyman hero Minecraft fans **** visuals? A garish mishmash of CGI and real world actors that clash worse than a creeper in a flower biome. The charm of Minecraft's pixelated freedom is buried under a generic 'save the world' story that feels like it was ripped from a dozen better films none of which bothered to star a Jack Black who seems to think yelling and flailing is a substitute for depth. Super Mario knew how to balance nostalgia with heart; this just shovels Easter eggs and tired gags into a pit and calls it a day. It's not just terrible it's a betrayal of everything that makes Minecraft special, leaving you longing for the Mushroom Kingdom instead of this blockheaded bore.TLDR - Jack Black ruined this movie and he is a bloated slob who phoned it in.\"]"

And I LOVE David Batista, but all I could think any time he appeared on screen, is Oh Look David Batista. You have to cast less known actors in big fantasy movies like this, because it just takes the watcher out of the movie, it takes you OUT of the beautiful world building when Zendaya with weird eyes appears on screen every so often. Completely jolts you out of the fantasy and back to \"Oh. Zendaya looks kinda weird in this movie.\" or \"haha look its David Batista\".',\n",
       " 'This might be my favorite movie !\\nDune (2021) is a sci-fi movie adapted from a roman directed by Dennis Villeneuve with Timothée chalamet as Paul Atréides  and Zendaya as Chani\\n\\nIn Dune(2021) Paul Atréides follows his very important and powerful family to the desertic planet of Arrakis gifted by the Imperium , where a very important ressource is collected and put on the market, but after an conspiracy and a betrayal Paul have to flee on the planet where he will met the native désert’s people, the Fremen\\n\\nThe actors were chosen perfectly and respected the physical descriptions given in the roman with the exception of some like Liet Kynes who was played by a woman. I also loved the makeup art on the Harkonnen family and the Eyes of Ibad\\n\\nThe film technique were amazing ! I think we cannot represent Arrakis better than they did , the lighting were very good on the desert and the pictures and ambiance were perfect \\nThe soundtrack by Hans Zimmer was flawless !\\nI really loved the costumes, from the Paul outfit on Caladan or Jessica outfit on the Arrakis arrival to the distille and Harkonnen Armor\\nAnd that’s why this movie won 6 oscars for 10 nominations\\n\\nDune explore theme like ecology power and colonialism.The film shows how the struggle for the rare ressource spice touch political, economic, and cultural conflicts, mirroring real-world tensions over oil and natural resources.  And my favorite theme is religion because its a big interest to me at this moment in my life, i love debatting about religion, learning about the story of religion so i absolutly loved the religion thème and everything its brings to the story \\n\\nFinally i really recommend to the movie watcher to try to read dune !!! Even though the adaptation is perfect in therm of cinematography i think the plot is very hard to fully understand and the movie miss a lot of scene and aspect of the story . So as a lover of Dune universe i fully recommend the book before watching the movie !',\n",
       " 'Extremely slow & boring, most action occurs in the dark and is hard to see. I was 2 hours into it before it grabbed my interest then was very anticlimactic.',\n",
       " 'Exceptional, wildly fantastic and never a dull moment. Truly spectacular in every possible way a movie can be. Cast all excels in character, cinematography out of this world. Worth the wait, for sure.',\n",
       " 'EPIC SCALE MOVIE\\nCGI WAS AMAZING, as well as the score, acting, plot, and cinematography.\\nthe movie overstayed its welcome a little bit, with some scenes dragging out the film to its colossal 2:30 runtime. this being said, the movie was great and i would definitely recommend to any drama or sci fi lovers.',\n",
       " 'Um espetáculo. Na minha opinião um dos melhores filmes dos últimos anos.',\n",
       " \"I've watched 👀 this movie at least ten times, that should say Everything!!!\",\n",
       " 'Not bad. I still prefer the classic one from 1984 though (which I\\'ve just rewatched). I can\\'t make comparisons with the books because I didn\\'t read them, so I don\\'t know how much the films differ from the original story. I can only make a comparison with the first film and I definitely liked more the characters of that one. I\\'ve found them having more personality. In this one I find the characters more \"flat\". It\\'s still not bad though, good special effects and interesting lore',\n",
       " 'A slogfest of a story, without any exciting moments to consider this movie memorable. The 1.5 stars are for the fact that the movie is undeniably beautiful with incredible sound. Feels like this movie was made to set up for the vastly superior second chapter.']"
