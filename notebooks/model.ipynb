       " \"Minecraft 2025 is a colossal misfire that makes you wonder how anyone could fumble a property as endlessly creative as Minecraft this badly especially when Super Mario proved video game adaptations can be vibrant, fun, and worth watching. Instead of a blocky wonderland bursting with imagination, we get a soulless, corporate cash-grab that's as uninspired as a dirt hut built by a first-day player. And at the center of this mess is Jack Black, whose over-the-top shtick as Steve feels less like a character and more like a bloated, annoying caricature of himself phoning it in with the energy **** who ate too many pork chops and forgot what made his Bowser a good character.Where Super Mario delivered a tight, colorful romp with a villain you couldn't help but like to hate, Minecraft stumbles through a plot so thin it could've been scribbled on a 3x5 card with a fat sharpie. The live action gimmick is a disaster with corpulent Jack Black waddling around in a turquoise shirt against a green screen looks less like an adventure and more like a sad clown act at a kid's party no one showed up to. His constant mugging and forced musical numbers grate on the nerves, turning Steve into a flabby, loud distraction instead of the everyman hero Minecraft fans **** visuals? A garish mishmash of CGI and real world actors that clash worse than a creeper in a flower biome. The charm of Minecraft's pixelated freedom is buried under a generic 'save the world' story that feels like it was ripped from a dozen better films none of which bothered to star a Jack Black who seems to think yelling and flailing is a substitute for depth. Super Mario knew how to balance nostalgia with heart; this just shovels Easter eggs and tired gags into a pit and calls it a day. It's not just terrible it's a betrayal of everything that makes Minecraft special, leaving you longing for the Mushroom Kingdom instead of this blockheaded bore.TLDR - Jack Black ruined this movie and he is a bloated slob who phoned it in.\"]"

Sin necesidad de leer los libros, comprenderás a la perfección todo el contexto. El director busca deleitarnos con sus tomas cinematográficas y su espectacular sonido ambiental. Una obra de arte digna de un Oscar. El único problema que le veo, y por el que no le doy un 10, es el comienzo. Puede ser muy tedioso, pero se entiende perfectamente por qué.\\n\\nConclusión: Esta es una película que definitivamente tienes que ver en algún momento. El comienzo puede ser lento porque te da mucho contexto. No pierdas la oportunidad de verla.\\n\\nCalificación: 8.5/10',\n",
       " 'Took me a while to get into it, but as someone who has not read the Dune books, it truly feels like a book. I can see the influence and see how the book must have been like, I definitely plan to read the books at some point. Some of the decisions are a bit sub-par though. They should 100% have had a different cast. Yes, sure, they chose some good actors, but starring Zendaya in something like this is an absolute no. And I LOVE David Batista, but all I could think any time he appeared on screen, is Oh Look David Batista. You have to cast less known actors in big fantasy movies like this, because it just takes the watcher out of the movie, it takes you OUT of the beautiful world building when Zendaya with weird eyes appears on screen every so often. Completely jolts you out of the fantasy and back to \"Oh. Zendaya looks kinda weird in this movie.\" or \"haha look its David Batista\".',\n",
       " 'This might be my favorite movie !\\nDune (2021) is a sci-fi movie adapted from a roman directed by Dennis Villeneuve with Timothée chalamet as Paul Atréides  and Zendaya as Chani\\n\\nIn Dune(2021) Paul Atréides follows his very important and powerful family to the desertic planet of Arrakis gifted by the Imperium , where a very important ressource is collected and put on the market, but after an conspiracy and a betrayal Paul have to flee on the planet where he will met the native désert’s people, the Fremen\\n\\nThe actors were chosen perfectly and respected the physical descriptions given in the roman with the exception of some like Liet Kynes who was played by a woman. I also loved the makeup art on the Harkonnen family and the Eyes of Ibad\\n\\nThe film technique were amazing ! I think we cannot represent Arrakis better than they did , the lighting were very good on the desert and the pictures and ambiance were perfect \\nThe soundtrack by Hans Zimmer was flawless !\\nI really loved the costumes, from the Paul outfit on Caladan or Jessica outfit on the Arrakis arrival to the distille and Harkonnen Armor\\nAnd that’s why this movie won 6 oscars for 10 nominations\\n\\nDune explore theme like ecology power and colonialism.The film shows how the struggle for the rare ressource spice touch political, economic, and cultural conflicts, mirroring real-world tensions over oil and natural resources.  And my favorite theme is religion because its a big interest to me at this moment in my life, i love debatting about religion, learning about the story of religion so i absolutly loved the religion thème and everything its brings to the story \\n\\nFinally i really recommend to the movie watcher to try to read dune !!! Even though the adaptation is perfect in therm of cinematography i think the plot is very hard to fully understand and the movie miss a lot of scene and aspect of the story . So as a lover of Dune universe i fully recommend the book before watching the movie !',\n",
