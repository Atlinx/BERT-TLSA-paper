       " 'original_text': ['Spike Spiegel is a bounty hunter with a dark, violent past. Nowadays, he roams between the seedier colonies of space along with his partner Jet Black and their spaceship Bebop as they try to catch a bounty or two, barely making a living at it. Some of their bounties, like the mysterious Faye Valentine and the intelligent \\'data dog\\', Ein, end up as fellow partners. Is Spike trying to justify prior misdeeds by working for the right side of the law? What will happen when his past catches up to him? And what of the pasts of his fellow shipmates? Will any of them survivelong enough to find out? \\n\\nCowboy Bebop has been often referred to as the new anime noir, a title that does fit, but doesn\\'t even begin to fully describe it. Equal parts film noir, spaghetti western, and 70\\'s cop show; Cowboy Bebop is both retro and fresh at the same time. A very stylish, beautifully crafted series that deserves much more attention than it gets. If ever there was a series more deserving to be a sleeper hit, Bebop is it.\\n\\nCowboy Bebop is well suited to TV. Each episode manages to stand alone, but at the same time link together an overall larger story. Even if you only see two or three episodes, not exactly in order, one wouldn\\'t be lost, and would find enjoyment in them. In order to truly appreciate it, though, one must see it through.\\n\\nCowboy Bebop also presents a realistic view of the future. Spike and Jet travel in what to us would be a highly sophisticated craft, but to them is the modern day equivalent of a 1976 El Camino. The places they visit are far from what one would expect. Instead of Neo-Tokyo with its shiny, impossibly tall skyscrapers that never end, we have Neo-Tijuana, with its dusty dirt roads, run down shacks and migrant workers. Space is ethnic, but not in the Star Trek sanitized for the sake of politically correctness way. Each colony reflects a melting pot more akin to Los Angeles or New York City than any Blade Runner wannabe ever could.\\n\\nThis striving for realism also is reflected in the character designs. Spike is lanky and handsome in his own way, but by no means is he a slender pretty boy. Faye is sexy and curvy, but she\\'s no large breasted bimbo. Jet is burly, not fat, and has traits that would make one think he is of Russian descent. Ein can easily be recognized as a Welsh corgi, and not just another undistinguishable mutt. The only one who looks remotely like a \\'cartoony\\' character is Ed, and even then no one would ever mistake her as anything -but- a scrawny preteen tomboy. (And to see her name and appearance, you\\'d think she just got off the boat from the Philippines.)\\n\\nThe animation is beyond superb. Its quality excels over most current releases. Cowboy Bebop uses computer graphics, but does so in such a fluid, breathtaking manner. There are practically no scenes that feel \\'artificial\\', like what\\'s going on in the foreground is totally separate from the background. Many computer-generated anime can\\'t seem to shake the look that the characters are just floating in front of the background stills. Everything in Cowboy Bebop seems to breathe with life and motion, even in otherwise stoic scenes, and it\\'s a rarity and a marvel to behold.\\n\\nAnother bonus Cowboy Bebop has going for it is the soundtrack. Yoko Kanno scores (literally) again with her work for this series. The opening theme alone is already one of *the* best intro pieces I have ever heard. The blend of jazz and blues is absolutely perfect in setting the mood of the series. I ask you, has this woman ever -done- any bad music? (Of course not!)\\n\\nThen there\\'s the storyline. Even though each episode stands quite well on its own, with poignant moments interspersed with exciting action, the underlying theme of Spike Spiegel and his motivations for what he does is absolutely intriguing. With each flashback, you get one more piece of the puzzle, from Spike\\'s shady origins to the loves that influenced the way he is. Maybe his bounty hunting is really a search for identity as much as a way of life he has chosen. The plot and characterization in Cowboy Bebop have a sophistication and subtlety that is practically one-of-a-kind. It\\'s hard to find movies this involving, much less animated television series. Cowboy Bebop simply puts most anime...and Hollywood, to shame.\\n\\nOn the surface, it\\'s easy to dismiss as \\'70s retro fluff. \"Hey, there\\'s Vega$ all over again!\" And yes, many a Japanese and American movie star or feature is lampooned in one form or another during each episode. Cases in point: Spike Spiegel is a postmodern Lupin III. And in the first episode alone, Asimov Sorenson and Katarina.... can we say Desperado, kids? (Heck, even Quentin Tarantino seems to have a cameo!) But beneath that noir veneer is a very human drama that has just enough humor and clever dialogue to be realistic, yet highly entertaining. This is a must-have for any serious collector of Japanese animation.\\nSimply put, this anime is one of the best.',\n",
       "  \"I have to admit, shoujo anime are something that I'm always very hesitant about, the fact that nowadays, they don't seem to have much original concepts, is only one of the many reason why I'm reluctant to place them carefully in my anime schedule. Ouran was not one of those. It's probably because I wasn't very knowledgeable on anime when I first watched Ouran High school Host Club. But it was also because I was drawn into something that I know people will find cliché at first, but trust me dear, a few more episodes, and you'll find yourself crying silently alone at 4am in themorning. \\n\\nSo lets dig in.\\n\\nStory: 10/10\\n\\nOur story starts off with our dear Haruhi Fujioka, an innocent girl who just happens to be in a prestigious school called Ouran Academy. Basically somewhere rich people drop their rich kids off, and hope that they learn something. Haruhi is not the typical student, as she is a commoner, who has outstanding grades, and eventually got a scholarship. She stumbles upon an abandoned music room where she will eventually find people that she'll later on regret finding.\\n\\nAn idiot, 2 more idiots. The loli, quiet guy, and very, very manipulating douche.\\n\\nAnd this is the part where she just so happens to break 3 million yen vase and very, very, manipulating douche, makes her pay off her debt by working for the host club.\\n\\nI also forgot to mention that she is in fact dressed as guy.\\n\\nI hate it. I hate how this show made me love these idiots. I hate how this show made me cry because of these idiots. And I hate that very, very manipulating douche, who made me not hate him.\\n\\nThe story is somewhat tragic, I know they are portrayed as rich and all, but the host club has people with different stories that the viewer might relate to. I found very, very manipulating douche's story similar to my own.\\n\\nI do find that around the end, the story makes up a last minutes plot twist, which I had expected. But I didn't care since the stories before the last minute twist had left me bawling my eyes out so really, I was still emotionally effected by the time the twist occurred.\\n\\nYou soon gradually love how the pieces form a puzzle for the host club, how the members were intertwined and how this one idiot made a club.\\n\\nThe story is hilarious, the characters are hilarious. Even I have to admit I had viewed this as a very easy-going show until it starts torturing my heart. You'll fail to pass it off as just another harem, because it isn't. If you need proof just look at all the damages to my heart and internal organs. \\n\\nIt's all their fault.\\n\\nI found the story enjoyable and heart-wrenching.\\n\\nArt: 8/10\\n\\nRoses are flying everywhere. That is all.\\n\\nSound: 9/10\\n\\nI was pleasantly surprised at the music, the nice, light, orchestral, classical music for the theme of the host club that you'll hear every once in a while is very relaxing. The theme song is just..\\n\\nMeh.\\n\\nI mean, it's not bad, it's just not good either. \\nI did watch the English Dub.\\n\\nEnglish Dubs are something I know a lot are reluctant about, but the casting is great. The voices fit perfectly. It's just perfect, I even liked Rengi's voice actor. It's great. I watched the sub, and to be honest, I find both good. It's up to personal preference, but for now, I recommend both really.\\n\\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\\nFind out for yourself. I'AM NOT WRITING SOMETHING THAT I KNOW IS GOING TO MAKE ME CRY, OKAY?\\n\\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\nI'm just going to say that I found myself in a black hole once I finished. Desperately searching for a second season. I loved this anime, the character development is beautiful. You'll see what they've gone through in the past, and it's beautiful. It really is. Especially that manipulating douche's story (reason why I was found isolating myself for a week after an emotional breakdown at 4am)\\n\\nOverall: 10/10\\n\\nDid I enjoy something that seemed ridiculous? Yeah\\n\\nDid I enjoy a lot of idiots doing idiotic things? Yeah\\n\\nDid I enjoy crying at 4am after watching this show? Yeah\\n\\nIs this show going to put you in an emotional mental state after you watch it?\\n\\nWell, yeah.\",\n",
       "  '*Spoiler free-ish review* Silver spoon is the very definition of \"Don\\'t judge the book by It\\'s cover\" Silver spoon is a anime/manga from the Author of the famous Fullmetal Alchemist and tells a story about Hachiken, a smart guy who doesn\\'t know what he wants from his life. He is cornered by his parents who want him to join boarding school for his destined university. Finally he has mental breakdown and says screw it and joins a agricultural school far away from his home. Lesson by lesson he begins to understand the lives of the people who live on the countryside and how they life from hand tomouth. \\n\\nHachi is conflicted since many of his fellow classmates come from big old households who feel the agricultural school as necessity for inheriting the family business while Hachi joined the school to escape his past life.\\n\\nSilver Spoon makes the watcher question his morals and ethical choices. They show how hard living by agriculture really is in realistically manner. \\nIt\\'s easy to get in debt, hurt yourself from overwork and most important is to commit your whole life for your craft. \\nIt also makes you question your own morals and think about animal rights. It\\'s very refreshing to see how boldly they show the process of raising the livestock with care only to have them end up as their livelihood.\\n\\nAll the ethical and moral questions aside, Silver spoon has this lovely SOL and romance as part of it. I enjoyed and cherished every single episode.\\nThe OP and ED set the feel and they\\'re perfect for this show. Especially the ED is heartwarming.\\n\\nI totally recommend you watch the anime and read manga afterwards. This series is a masterpiece within It\\'s own genre.',\n",
       "  \"This review is for both the first and second season of 3-Gatsu no Lion. 3-Gatsu no Lion is an absolute masterpiece in character writing, and as the show progresses, I keep finding myself getting blown away. I have never seen a show (or really any media) with a cast of such unfolding, believable, multi-dimensional, human characters. 3-Gatsu no Lion centers itself on a high-school Shogi player who suffers from overwhelming depression, and lives in relative isolation. The depression is visualized in absolutely beautiful ways through the animation, the metaphors and the protagonists inner monologue. And ultimately you find yourself rooting for acharacter who fails to see his value and assumes he is burdening all of those around him, while also seeing the outside perspective of how he is touching and shaping the lives of those around him and bettering the world, even though he cannot recognize it.  In spite of the inherently dark themes in the show, it always remains believable and never feels contrived or melodramatic.  And somehow, the show threads the needle and feels really uplifting instead of depressing.\\n\\nAnd while I think that the story of the protagonist earns this series a 10/10 rating by itself, I find myself getting blown away by how the show handles the side characters.  Every character in this world is incredibly human, and has their own motivations and struggles.  This show constantly subverts expectations by making you root for characters that lesser shows would have left as cliched antagonists or undeveloped background characters.  But 3-Gatsu no Lion lets these 'background characters' step into the foreground, sometimes even drifting away from following the protagonist for a while.  The reality is, the show introduces characters for you to hate, and then you wind up understanding them and sympathizing with them.  Or it sets up characters for you to overlook and then pulls the rug out from under you when you realize that they are just as complex people as the main character and have their own equal struggles.\\n\\nThe power of the show is that it is one of the few shows where the main character isn't the center of the universe, but is struggling inside a living breathing world.  And in most shows, the main character is 'special'.  In 3-Gatsu no Lion, he is definitely special, but so is everyone.  This is a show that is filled with characters that all could have been the main character, and that is an impressive feat.  And it also makes the main character's struggles more real and meaningful.\\n\\nI may be biased in that 3-Gatsu no Lion perfectly fits within my stylistic preference for shows (along with shows like Oregairu and Natsume Yuujincho).  But 3-Gatsu no Lion is the most 'human' show I've ever seen, and I think is a must-watch for anyone who likes Slice-of-Life shows, or emotional/uplifting shows.  This one is really special.\",\n",
       "  \"This is a review about how I felt over each aspect of the Anime and not a critical review.Thus it may be a bit biased Story and setting A story about a stray God.... seemed a bit unique, so I decided to try it.Figured that if many people love this, why not? Turns out I loved this anime too.The one thing I like about Noragami is that even though it was shown to be modern and had ancient roots, it never felt that they clashed as the modern setting did not try to be anything more than a setting and let the story Characters This anime isa character driven show with a heavy emphasis on character interactions, their problems and their development  from going through  said problems.Yato, our main God,  being the funniest and most stereotyped of them all, was the perfect fit for the series as he did not overshadow the other characters and still became a better being.Hiyori and Yukine got the best character devolopment and their interactions and problems felt believable. Overall great characters in a unique story.\\n\\nAnimation\\nNot much to talk about it except that it's a great fit for the story.See for yourself.\\n\\nSound\\nThe opening by Hello Sleepwalkers was a great hit when this anime was released and I can see why.They also have a unique soundtrack that fits the mysterious God vibe you get from thus show with the occasional drums to add to its fighting scenes.\\n\\nEnjoyment\\nIt will speak for itself after you get to the 3rd episode.Even though the comedy may feel a bit childish, it actually works really well.\\n*Spoiler*(Kind of)\\nI think the best comedic scene was when a guy tries to commit suicide due a certain God of poverty.\\n\\nOverall I would say that the first season was better than the second as while the second season focuses more on the story', the first focuses more on the characters , which is great to watch\\n\\nWatch this show if you are bored with shone type anime and love story driven titles like the Monogatari series\",\n",
       "  'When it involves new anime, hype usually starts with something small, the cause either due to a title being created by a prominent mangaka, being produced by the studio Madhouse, or being something that very, very subtly thinks outside the box. Then, the hype surrounding this new title becomes so ridiculously out-of-proportions that there’s little chance of the series fulfilling these expectations. With that said, I will introduce the 12-episode mystery known as Erased, whose birth, rise, apex, and decline in MyAnimeList.net’s (MAL) Top Anime rankings epitomize the hype machine as a whole. When Erased was first released, it surpassed Cowboy Bebop, Mushishi, Death Note,Gurren Lagann, the 2011 remake of Hunter X Hunter, Monster, and even Legend of the Galactic Heroes, all considered timeless, transcendent works of the medium. Erased settled into the top 10 for a while before soaring into the top 5 and, during this voyage into the upper echelon of the Anime Hall-of-Fame, I bought a nonrefundable ticket for the ride. As someone who adamantly sticks to the older, more renowned series, I was immediately suspicious of the widespread idolation of Erased but my insatiable urge to witness what the hype was about pushed me to watch this series. Whether its ranking on MAL and my decision was ultimately justified remains to be seen.\\n\\nErased revolves around a time-traveling mangaka named Satoru Fujinuma venturing into the past, reverting into a child in the process a la Dragon Ball GT, to confront his mother’s killer. As the drama unfolds, the series showcases a truly masterful, variety-filled soundtrack. When the focus is on R&amp;R, soft, barely audible guitar melodies ease into the atmosphere. When the pulse-pounding suspense is at its climax, tragic violin pieces are flawlessly alternated with sweeping, powerful piano tracks. Every once in a while, Erased experiments with different combinations of music, at one point having tech house and an opera string quartet perform the Fusion Dance.\\n\\nThough I am helplessly enamored of the show’s music, I am even more in love with the cinematic style involved in the animation of Erased. When Satoru discusses or thinks about his time-traveling powers, a film reel effect occurs with the film reel frames symbolizing Satoru watching his life so far like a movie. In episode 1, the smoke released form the cigarette of Satoru’s mother guides the transition from one scene to the next. In episode 3, Satoru visits the bedroom of Yuuki, a friend from long ago, and there’s a beautiful back-and-forth shift between past and present. In episode 5, there’s a cutaway to a painting of The Last Supper as Satoru eats his dinner to foreshadow what will occur next. The cinematic style in Erased climaxes at the end of episode 6, where Satoru is in the rain, about to be hauled off to jail, and he spots his mother’s killer. It is at that moment where everything suddenly stops (even the raindrops are frozen!) and turns black-and-white, the color erased (pun unintended) from the scene except for the killer’s dark red pupils. Let’s just say that what occurs in episode 6 doesn’t happen too often with anime titles.\\n\\nAs someone with a theme song fetish, I have always believed that an anime’s opening, which is often a viewer’s first glance at a title, can make or break the series. That said, the theme song for Erased isn’t particularly terrible but it’s not memorable in any way (It will never be compared to “Mystical Adventure”, “Tank!”, “Cruel Angel’s Thesis” or any of the other classic theme songs). The theme song for Erased is all about Satoru: him in a theater, him on the playground, him playing Rock Paper Scissors with his friends, him screaming outside in the snow, him running away from his mother’s killer (You get the point). The question: who is Satoru? He doesn’t have any unique physical features, personality quirks, or any special gifts besides the whole time-travel thingy. Satoru has a purpose that drives the series forward, to protect the ones he loves and even those he doesn’t know too well, but it’s hardly a unique purpose. In other words, Satoru is (shocker!) yet another one of those self-insert protagonists that I despise with a passion. Unfortunately, most of the supporting cast don’t fare much better when it involves depth and uniqueness. Hinazuki is the main female character of erased, one of those quiet loner types that never get a chance to really develop, a damsel-in-distress relying a little too much on Satoru to rescue her, and a child that acts nothing like a child (More on this later). Airi is one of Satoru’s co-workers with what’s easily the dumbest backstory ever (#candybarsarecursed). Kenya is a quiet, abnormally intelligent scholar of a child seeking to protect others just like Satoru (Kenya is, unfortunately, not black). The only person in Erased that actually acts like a real person is Mr. Yashiro, my favorite character. At first, Satoru’s teacher appears as relatable as possible whose gentle, relaxed personality resembles that of a midmorning autumn breeze. However, the depths of Mr. Yashiro’s soul reveal a mortal man marked by obsession, rejection, and an obvious yet intriguing plot twist. If only the rest of the cast of Erased were as complex as Mr. Yashiro…\\n\\n“If you don’t dig deeper, the readers won’t be able to see you in the work,” – Satoru’s editor (Episode 1)\\n\\nAbove all else, this is the underlying cause of every issue in Erased. When I look at Erased, I discover an ambitious young writer filled with larger-than-life ideas for his work but doesn’t know how to fully express them or inject his personality into his writing. This problem is apparent in Erased having some serious pacing issues and in the show not knowing what it wants to be (Erased is generally labeled a mystery but there are also sci-fi elements, an insane amount of time spent on the school grounds, and it mostly feels like a simple slice-of-life than a gripping suspense-thriller. Honestly, Erased would’ve been better had it stayed loyal to the mystery aspect). Spawning from the show’s lack of structure are, of course, the plot holes issue, like not explaining the effects of Satoru’s time-traveling or how he acquires this ability in the first place. It is obvious a little before the 15-year time skip but, afterwards, the animation style that I obsess over is decimated almost entirely, the once-overpowering OST lacks its flair for the dramatic, the plot isn’t as intense, and overall Erased just isn’t the absurdly addictive thriller that it used to be. The last (and probably most crucial) thing I don’t like about the author of Erased is how he characterizes children in his story; it’s like he was never truly a child himself. Me, I can easily recall and cherish my childhood. Being a young boy was building the biggest castle in the sandbox. Being a young boy was making fun of other boys who wanted or had relationships with a girl (Back then, we thought they were infested with “cooties”). Being a young boy was riding your bicycle down the street by yourself to the grocery store so that you could feel like “a real man”. Being a young boy was doing what you previously thought was scary or impossible or reckless. Being a young boy was fighting boredom by using your imagination to invent new methods of entertaining yourself. Being a young boy was about pulling pranks, getting into fights, and having fun.\\n\\nNo young boy or girl talks about an Edgar Allen Poe book that doesn’t exist. \\nNo young boy or girl jokes about having a friend kill someone. \\nNo young boy or girl willingly locks someone or allow themselves to be locked in a bus alone for days on end, no matter the circumstance. \\n\\nWhen I finished Erased, there wasn’t that empty feeling you get when you complete a memorable series, that feeling of “NOW what will I do to spend my time?” When I finished Erased, I immediately thought, “Should I write a review for this? Maybe I could use my time for something more productive and worthwhile.” That’s not what I thought when the life-changing experience known as Gurren Lagann came to a close (you know, a CLASSIC title). I was staring at my computer screen with my mouth agape and my eyes watering for what felt like forever (Somehow, I did not cry). As for Erased, I watched it, loved it, stopped loving it, tolerated it, and then it ended. As fast as an eye-roll, Erased has faded from MAL’s Top 10 and from my anime-watching life. In conclusion, this series wasn’t particularly terrible or great. In fact, it was so unmemorable that it will be eventually erased (pun intended) from my memory until its name pops up again one day and I’ll vaguely think, “Oh yeah, think I checked that out a while back.”',\n",
       "  'A few years back whenever i browse through random forums, whether it be on games or just about anything really, i would sometimes see people use this very interesting signature, a signature of the opening sequence dance of Lucky Star. But at that time i had no clue what lucky star was or did I really watch that much anime to know anything about it. I just had the impression that it was just a bunch of cute girls dancing. Then a few years later when i got into watching anime i was looking through MAL and i came across Lucky Star and i instantly wasreminded of that opening dance sequence that i would see in those forum user\\'s signatures. So i was all like HEY I REMEMBER THIS! So i decided to give it a shot. But before i even began to start watching it, I would approach a friend of mine and seek his opinion on the anime. During that time i just started to watch anime so i was not sure what was good or not and my friend told me that it was really boring and he only watched a total of 5 minutes of it then he decided to drop it. So for a while i decided not to watch it. Later on after watching more anime so i start to get a sense of what i like, i decided to try this anime knowing that my friend hates it. \\n\\nAND I AM REALLY FUCKING GLAD I DECIDED TO WATCH IT.\\n\\nI\\'ve always assumed that i would like what ever my friend likes since that seemed to be the case when i started out watching anime. But i have gained my independence in this. Basically i watch what i want. lol.\\n\\nANYHOW enough back story. REVIEW TIME!\\n\\nSTORY: 9\\nEven though this anime supposedly has no freaking story, i find that to be the beauty of it. Just how the hell can an anime where there is no story be good? Well it is possible. \\nThe so called \"Story\" revolves around these 4 girls that just live their lives in high school. At first you might say \"What the hell? that sounds stupid\" but it is actually really really interesting , to me at least. Lucky Star is one of those shows that you either don\\'t like or you love it. And i for one, loved it. \\nEven though it\\'s just about cute girls doing cute things living their lives, there are actually a few touching moments in this anime. \\n\\nART: 9\\nKYOTO ANIMATION \\'NUFF SAID!!\\n\\n\\n\\nHaha I am totally a fan boy of kyoani, but this type of animation is what kyoani is known for. The type of animation in Lucky Star is incredibly simple AND IT WORKS!\\n\\nI totally love the moe moe ness in this anime. This is probably the biggest selling point of the anime. THE EFFING MOE! But there are a lot of other enjoyable things about this other than its moe tastic animation.\\n\\nAt episode 10 we are introduced to the Anime Tenchou, and holy crap they really put a lot of effort into the animation. Once you watch it you would understand what i mean.\\n\\nSOUND: 9\\nThe music in this anime is great. I am particularly quite fond of the track \"FUN FUN FUN DAYO\" which i plan to learn it on the piano so i can have my own FUN FUN FUN.\\n\\nI also really liked the ending karaoke segment. It is very amusing to see the character\\'s seiyuu\\'s sing other songs. Konata\\'s (Hirano Aya) version of Cha la head cha la is just freaking hilarious.\\n\\nCharacter: 10\\nTHIS IS WHAT I LIKE MOST ABOUT LUCKY STAR!!!!\\n\\nIzumi Konata: This chick is f*cking funny. She is athletic yet hates it, she is really short and is an otaku. She lives with her dad which is okay with her playing Eroge\\'s (PORN GAMES!) And to top it all she is so god damn moe.\\n\\nHiiragi Tsukasa: I have always compared these twins with the twins in Clannad. I mean seriously, they look the Effing same. EXCEPT i do not hate the short hair one this time around. God i really dislike Ryou Fujibayashi. ANYHOW...... Tsukasa is totally the cute but stupid kind of person. Kind of like Konata but she\\'s more normal like.\\n\\nHiiragi Kagami: MAN OH MAN.  SHe is an awesome f*cking character. She is just like her alter ego Fujibayashi Kyou from Clannad, which is also my favorite chick from Clannad. She is the typical tsundere girl that tsukkomi\\'s every single chance she gets. She is aggressive one of the bunch and seeing her when she\\'s not is just absolutely great. \\n\\n(Just a random note, i really don\\'t know why i prefer these typical tsundere girls in most of the animes with a lot to choose from, maybe i just like aggressive chicks with purple hair, cough* cough* Sasasegawa Sasami from Little Busters cough* cough*)\\n\\n\\nTakara Myuki: Although Mal states her as a main character i see her more as a support character. The amount of screen time that she gets compared to the other three is small. Probably like 50%. Her character is the that of a really intellectual high class like ojou sama that isn\\'t a total bitch. She reminds me of Mugi-chan from K-On. same type of aura. It would be awesome if she got a lot more screen time.\\n\\nEnjoyment and overall: 9\\nI really enjoyed this anime. It is something i can keep on rewatching as much I want and not get bored of it. It is not one of those anime\\'s where it is the best watching it the first time around, no. It is one of those anime\\'s that you just sit back and relax and just enjoy the awesome nothingness that brings you a smile to your face. \\nThis is purely my perspective of this though. There is that phrase of \"maybe this isn\\'t your cup of tea\" Well i don\\'t really drink tea but i bet if this was turned into tea i would gladly say it is indeed my cup of tea.\\nSo if you like a story revolved around nothing and just like seeing a bunch of cute girls and a bunch of parodies than i am sure you would enjoy this anime. \\nIf not, well I can\\'t do anything about it. \\n\\n~Til Next time,\\nTomislol',\n",

       "  'So this is it, the anime that \"created\" Studio Ghibli. Story: Today, we all know the usual concept of an environmental fantasy story. An all-loving hero (or heroine) tries to stop stupid militaristic people from destroying nature and therefore endangering the human race as well. In the 1980s this was a message that needed to be put out there, even if it meant to be a little more direct with it. Nausicaä does a pretty good job in putting its message into an entertaining story that does not feel too heavy and doesn\\'t get boring either. The ending is a little farfetched, but its in typical fairytalefashion, so it is pretty much what you expect and there is no need to be disappointed by it. However, after so many years of environmental education, Nausicaä can feel a tad forced at times.\\n8/10\\n\\nArt:\\nLovely, colorful and detailed. Ghibli is a name that stands for animation quality and rightfully so. For a movie that is over 30 years old now, it still looks fresh and enjoyable. The character design is not very diverse, but they all look good, especially Nausicaä herself. The backgrounds are amazing as always and the animation fluent. It only really falls a little flat when compared to later Miyazaki works, but that is kind of an unfair thing to do. Comparing its age to its quality, there is hardly something they could\\'ve done better.\\n10/10\\n\\nSound:\\nThe soundtrack has a lot of different sounding pieces, so it\\'s kind of a hit or miss thing. For me personally, most of the tracks sounded pretty cool, though they didn\\'t always fit the scene. The key scenes however all got beautiful, fitting songs attached to them. The voice actors all do a pretty good job, I especially enjoyed Iemasa Kayumi as Kurotawa with his snarky attitude.\\n9/10\\n\\nCharacters:\\nThe whole movie revolves around Nausicaä, so it was essential to make her as likeable as possible. And she is. I mean, her character archetype has been done to death by now (and even before Nausicaä), but if a characters actions and reasons are coherent and make sense, that is not a real problem. I for once wanted her to succeed and felt bad for her whenever things went wrong, that\\'s the best thing you can achieve. The rest of the cast did its job, but let\\'s be honest, this movie is a one man...er, girl show. Which is a shame, because some of them seemed interesting, but they hardly have the time to shine.\\n9/10\\n\\nEnjoyment:\\nThis is a beautiful movie that stood the test of time, like so many Ghibli movies do. I wouldn\\'t call myself a fan, but I can acknowledge their quality. While I found Nausicaä to be one of the most likeable main characters I\\'ve encountered, the focus on the message was a bit much for me at times. It\\'s a good and important one, but I prefer things to be a little more subtle. Nonetheless, I was entertained well and would watch Nausicaä again.\\n8/10\\n\\nOverall:\\n8.8/10',\n",
       "  'Angel Beats. What an Anime, what a story. A short story considering some of the Anime out there, but is far from a weakness. In this review, I would like to convince everyone questioning if they should watch this anime or not, to watch it. The review will be spoiler-free up until the last part where I will be reviewing the end in detail (I will tag a spoiler there, so just stop reading when you get that far). The first episodes of the anime I was kinda questioning everything. Who is this \"Angel\" why is everyone in this world? Why are they rebelling against this\"Angel\", how did everyone get there? And do not worry. All these questions will be answered during the show. I am not gonna lie. The first episodes were indeed a bit hard to understand, which made it kinda questionable if I enjoyed it or not. But I kept watching, and it became more and more awesome.\\n\\nEverything becomes so well explained, and everything goes so well together. I promise you that you will enjoy one of the best Anime I have watched, with the best ending I\\'ve ever seen in ANY movie/show/anime EVER. (I will discuss the ending further down). The last episode will leave you with the feeling as you have been hungry for days and you just ate the best meal of your life. As if you have been thirsty for days and just drank your favorite refreshment. As if you have been wanting nicotine for a long time and finally get it. You will be finished. You will be fed up, unthirsty and satisfied. \\n\\nWhen it comes to the soundtracks. Oh the soundtracks. I am listening to them as I am writing this review, as the soundtracks are so emotional and well made. They complete the anime. Everything from the band to the op and the outro song plays its part in the story. \\n\\nThe only reasoning for giving 9/10 instead of a full score of 10/10 is due to that the plot might be weak at times in the early/mid episodes. For the score of the ending, I give 100/10. \\n\\n\\nENDING/SPOILERISH REVIEW COMES NOW. IF YOU HAVEN\\'T WATCHED THE ANIME YET, STOP READING HERE AND GO WATCH IT RIGHT NOW. COME BACK TO READ THIS ONCE YOU\\'VE FINISHED.\\n\\nHow I cried. How I fucking cried. I cried to the point of no longer feeling like a man, rather a baby that had his candy stolen. I have never been more amazed of a ending like this in my entire 19-year old life. Yokatta mi to. Happy for them. (op song). The tears of pure happiness and satisfaction is what I would describe them as. Everyone, leaving the world feeling so satisfied with everything. How Yuzuru confronted Kanade with his love. How Kanade couldn\\'t say I love you back because she would disappear. (Many people are calling this romance uncalled for and I will come to this a bit further down). How Yurippe said good bye. (Jaa ne, an informal friendly, will definitely see you later. )\\n\\nThere is no easy way of describing the questions I had in my head after watching this anime. Just the whole feel around everything after the end totally changed. When we saw how Yuzuru died and came to this world by donating his organs I got goosebumps. When Kanade said she was the one who got Yuzuru\\'s heart I swear I got goosebumps from my toes to my hair. I swear that even the inside of my eyeball got goosebumps. This is the strongest moment I have witnessed in my entire life. And it goes over a lot of IRL stuff I\\'ve seen. \\n\\nIt can\\'t be put to words, simple as that. How all of these people had an unfulfilling life before they came there and had a blast. It can really compare to a lot of stuff in the real world. The track \"My song\" from Masami Iwasawa made a lot more impact after knowing she would disappear to a happier life. How she lost her voice and couldn\\'t sing in the real world no matter how much she loved it, and now coming to this world, she can sing as much as she want. It\\'s too beautiful to put to words, as much of this anime is.\\n\\nRegarding Yuzuru (Otonashi) and Kanade\\'s romance in the end. A lot of people said they \"cringed\" when Yuzuru confessed to Kanade, as it was \"uncalled for\". For me, this is a questionable way of describing it. Yuzuru was the guy who always questioned why they attacked her. He was the one who saw straight through her and realized she is actually a human-being with a lot of feelings held up inside her. Yuzuru was the one to make Kanade open up.\\n\\nTo me, I always believed that Yuzuru had something for Kanade. He loved her. Yes, it is a relationship built over a very little period of time, but how can this affect how strong it is? Kanade is carrying Yuzuru\\'s heart, and even before Yuzuru knowing this, he loved her. How can this not be bound by faith?  To me, how fast a relationship progresses doesn\\'t matter as long as it is STRONG. Which is exactly what Yuzuru and Kanade\\'s releationship is.\\n\\nI could go on, and on, and on about this anime. But I am gonna leave it at these final words:\\n\\nIf there is something this anime has taught me, it is this: Some people are struggling. Some people are having problems some of us can\\'t imagine exists. But it doesn\\'t stop them from having a big heart, and it doesn\\'t stop them from fighting on. So whenever you are facing some uphill battles, continue. As you never know what the reward will be for finally getting up that hill and letting go of the past, thus accepting your problems and struggles to move on.',\n",
       "  'The best animated show I have ever seen. Period. I\\'ll tell you why, hopefully. At first when I read the synopsis I said to myself, \"this show doesn\\'t look very good, time traveling with a microwave or something?\" it seemed kind of weird to me. But after a few weeks after I went ahead and gave it shot because of all the amazing reviews it got. The first 6 episodes were really good, but then after that it turned into something beyond excellence. Its hard to describe how great of a show it was the last 18 episodes. It pretty much changed my life. It alsotaught me that you can\\'t really cheat time or life for that matter. Many mixed feelings from this show, happiness, sadness, scared, confused and at the same time enjoying the heck out of the show. Now ill get to the review (Nostalgia is getting the best of me while writing this... sniff.... sniff)\\n\\nStory 10/10\\nBefore this show I hadn\\'t seen any other show that has to do with time traveling or even science, there are probably some but none I have seen or heard of. And with this comes a very unique story. The pacing at first can feel slow for some people, but then after a few episodes. BAM. Twists after twist and then the pacing of the show moves perfectly as the show goes on. They truly used this story to its best, they didn\\'t do anything half the effort. They put every bit of effort into this storyline and executed in an excellent way without messing it up. Because with time traveling as the story it could get really confusing and boring. But not the case here with Steins gate. Can\\'t stress enough on how well the story is developed in this show. Don\\'t want to say anything else. You\\'ll have to watch the show to receive the awesomeness I got. \\n\\nCharacters 10/10\\nProbably the best developed and interesting characters of any show I have seen, especially the major ones. Okabe is charismatic, comedic, thoughtful, kind, and very intelligent. He definitely means good intentions for everyone and everything he does. He\\'ll always act like someone is calling him on his phone in times of when he doesn\\'t know what to say, which fits in great with whatever scene he is in. And he is guy that will never give up and puts forth every bit of effort into what he does. Very original, definitely not your typical cliché character. Makise. Main female protagonist of the show. Definitely a tsundere and my favorite also. At first seems like your typical tsundere character but later on in the series really develops quite well and we get to see different sides of her throughout the show. Takes an interest into Okabe and helps him in his journey of the time machine and his struggles. Also very intelligent. Would get into more detail about the other characters but these two are the main, main characters that make the show the best it can be. The other characters are great too. Well developed and have great personalities that fits in well with the show. The only other show that rivals this with character development would be code geass or clannad (those shows have good character development, right?) but great job here also.\\n\\nArt/Animation 9/10\\nWhile not perfect here, definitely above average. The character art is great for all the characters. Wont say much here. Animations are fluid and smooth. Overall has a dark tone to the series especially the last 16 or so episodes. Lighting is great also.\\n\\nSound 8/10\\nDefinitely the weakest part here, but not weak on its own. The opening is pretty good, fits well with the series. Soundtrack is good. Nothing really special here.\\n\\nOverall 10/10\\nI enjoyed watching this more than any other show. The characters are so likeable all in their own way. You\\'ll definitely feel for each character at the end of the show. This show will make you cry, laugh, and smile. Well it should. It was that awesome. This will probably be the only show I will re watch just because of the amazing storyline and character list. Such a unique show nothing really else like this. Very original, not sure if that means its good or bad, but probably good. Didn\\'t think it was boring for one second. If there would be a flaw, it would probably be the slow start to the show, but I don\\'t think it is, it might be for some people though.\\n\\nI would start watching this show right now if I were you, it will definitely be worth your time, it was worth my time. And you might think if just some fanboy for steins gate, but I don\\'t think that is the case. This show is amazing, a masterpiece. \\n\\nOne more thing, I don\\'t really recommend watching the OVA, it kind of ruined the \"feelings\" I had after the original series. If I were I would wait a few days after watching the show, then watch the movie (which is awesome also) and then if you really want to you can watch the OVA, that\\'s my take on it.',\n",
       "  \"This will have spoilers. Majo no Takkyuubin, Kiki's Delivery Service, is a coming-of-age story for a little witch girl, who ultimately wants to find her place in a growing hustle-and-bustle city that is largely unamicable and unfamiliar with witches. This makes it difficult for Kiki to find her place in society, but this film teaches that through hard work, kindness, perseverance, and a little help from the right people, you can find where you belong. This story highlights the importance of valuing the slower, more earnest things in life; whether that's a friend who loves art, the elderly, airships, friends, or a welcoming bakery shop owner.In the grand scheme of things, taking the time to do the great things you love, (and making it a part of your everyday life) is worth more than anything. \\n\\nAs with most any Ghibli movie, the art and style used are very aesthetically pleasing, fitting, and beautiful. It truly is a work of art. The film demonstrates a very pleasing scenery of nature, in the woods and suburbs, but also highlights the hustle and bustle of the city through the advancing technology of cars, airships, cops, and even the fact that the newer generations in the city seem pretty unfamiliar and even aghast when it comes to witches like Kiki.  \\n\\nOverall it is a very heartwarming and wholesome watch when seeing this little girl try her hardest to do things seemingly out of her reach, only to be pushed in the right direction by the best of people. She learns to make friends, grows confident in her abilities and appearance, and despite a couple of big mishaps, she finds herself at home.\",\n",
       "  'Monster is a compelling Psychological, Mystery, Drama that is heavily driven by its thrilling story. Some who watch this may not be able to get into it but the rest will enjoy the experience. Set in Germany, the story is about a very promising surgeon Dr. Tenma who ends up being betrayed, just for doing what he believed was right. However what he thought that he did was right ended up coming back to him later, for the better and worse. In the first couple episodes the series keeps on alternating from slowly developing its story to going into a time skip. However the story soonfinds itself as it develops at a steady pace. At this point though you wouldn’t know where the story is heading or what to expect next, so you’re just forced sit tight and experience whatever the story gives. \\n\\nThe characters are what make this story. With numerous anime series out there revolving around kids and young adolescence; it is refreshing to see one that revolves around a variety of characters from adults to children. Dr. Tenma is very interesting himself as he is realistically portrayed, in the way that he acts and interacts and what’s more is that he goes through major developments throughout the story. Also a lot of the other characters are portrayed incredibly well, including the ones that only appear for 1 or 2 episodes.\\n\\nMonster truly deserves credit for its animation because at the time it initially aired, it would be one of the best looking dramas. Superb environments with German aesthetics, plus everything has completely fluid movements and the characters even have Naoki Urasawa’s design. The music also suits the eerily, dramatic, atmosphere of this series well and if it wasn’t for the numerous silent moments I would have thought the music was perfect. \\n\\nOverall Monster isn’t just an anime series; it is something to be experienced, for its intriguing and suspenseful premise. The way, in which the mood can quickly change, from slow paced character building to sheer horror, using various devices is an amazing feat in itself. Some people who watch this may not be able to get into it, due to the lack of excitement but for those who are patient will certainly enjoy this anime for its dark theme and compelling story.\\n\\n^_^',\n",
       "  \"Character progression, art style, story. This series takes these values to heights that make film critics shimmer with satisfaction and guarantees it a solid rating. I, however, am no film critic. I'm a simple guy donning simple tastes and battling with depression. Personally, I wish I never watched this. To my untrained ear, the music seemed monotonous throughout the series and continued to carry a tone of despair and solitude. Through my simplified vision, the art style seemed forced and uncomfortable. In my dull and shallow mind, the story felt overly romanticized and stagnant. Through my naivety, I blindly became attached to the characters, and forced myself to watchthem struggle through a life that is less than they deserve.\\n\\nI sit here, having finished the final episode, wondering why things end up the way they do, and why we are so powerless against it.\\n\\nThis review may be absolutely worthless to anyone who stumbles upon it, but I had to find somewhere to express my experience before I do something far more stupid on impulse.\",\n",
       "  'There are very few things in this world that can truly ruffle my feathers. But let me tell you, when I see people taking a massive dump on Rent-a-Girlfriend because they can\\'t deal with a main character who has flaws, it drives me right up the wall every time. Rent-a-Girlfriend is not a masterpiece. Heck, it\\'s not even one of the top anime of the season. But it does something that few other shows of its kind do: it\\'s not afraid to present a horrendously broken protagonist struggling to deal with his own problems. Ya\\'ll probably recognize the generic harem protagonist: average looks, totally oblivious, prone tomisunderstandings and extremely horny. That\\'s basically the recipe, right? Rent-a-Girlfriend\\'s protagonist Kazuya is exactly like that, but instead of treating those flaws I listed as a joke, the show puts them under a magnifying glass and lets Kazuya stare at them intently. He sees how uncool he is. He understands how desperate he is. And to top it all off, the show starts with him being dumped by his girlfriend of one month, which has utterly annihilated the little confidence he probably had to begin with.\\n\\nKazuya is not a hero. He\\'s not the shounen protagonist who always does the right thing. He\\'s not the cool guy in class that all the girls like. He\\'s not even the likable dork that blunders his way to happiness. He\\'s a down-on-his-luck twenty year old virgin who hates himself and confuses desirability for worth; in other words, he feels like he\\'s nothing unless some cute girl wants to be romantically involved with him.\\n\\nHe\\'s screwed up. And it\\'s this screwed up nature of his that leads him to literally rent the anime\\'s main heroine Chizuru as a girlfriend. Incidentally, Chizuru is a near-perfect foil to Kazuya; she\\'s capable, driven, smart, thoughtful, and a rather attractive specimen of a woman. She also happens to be the perfect balm to Kazuya\\'s broken personality.\\n\\nI mean that when I say it; Chizuru\\'s purpose as a character is to \"fix\" Kazuya. She puts him in his place when he does something wrong, gives him confidence when he has none, pulls him to his feet when he\\'s feeling hopeless, and supports him when nobody else believes he\\'s worth the time of day. I\\'d even go so far as to say that the draw of this show is not hoping that Kazuya ends up with Chizuru, but believing that Kazuya can be fixed, and can therefore become worthy of her, whether they end up together or not.\\n\\nRent-a-Girlfriend is not a harem (at least not in its first season). It\\'s a boy-meets-girl story and character drama with a million extra steps and complications. Are those million extra steps and complications necessary? No. Not all of them. The story is riddled with silly drama sideshows that slow the pace of the character development. That\\'s why I didn\\'t give the anime a higher score. But it\\'s still a decent show despite that, and the fact that people love to hate its protagonist just because he\\'s not another perfect anime gigachad or something gives me a migraine.\\n\\nBe nice to the kid; he\\'s already suffering enough.',\n",
       "  \"Demon Slayer is a visual treat with beautiful sound to back it up. The story is basically a venn diagram of Naruto, Bleach, Shaman King, Tokyo Ghoul, and Inuyasha. A decent distillation of the good stuff with tolerable trope-creep and superior pacing. Except for Zenitsu - he's an unbearable looney toon and hopefully they tone that guy down in future seasons. Should YOU watch it? The first five episodes are top notch in all dimensions. The world is built beautifully, the key characters engage us, the tone is set to mature and mysterious, future directions are tantalizing. Everything stews together perfectly and starts to smell amazing. Beautifulartwork, compelling themes, lovely sound, great animation - and a zero-to-hero training arc that is as good as they can get, I suppose. But in the fifth episode a clear shift in direction put me on the fence...\\n\\nBehind the first door, the show may live up to the promise of the first five episodes and I would be happy I kept watching. Behind the second, the forgettable shonen formula wrings all the special sauce out of the manga, which I don't ever plan to read, and serves us the rest with a sprinkle of badass fight scenes to entice us into consuming trash. Thankfully it lived up to my hopes many times and only lapsed into garbage territory breifly in ways that don't matter that much. The Gotei-9 for example were absurdly lame, but they're only on screen long enough to screw up half an episode. The fight scenes were VERY badass, and spread in a thick layer across the entire season rather than sprinkled with a cherry on top of episode 19. While our main character is a bit of a wet blanket and his crew as useful as urinal cakes, between Nezuko and the bad guys it works out. \\n\\nMy take is that you will not be disappointed with the quality of the first five episodes, and will see in that time exactly what the show has to offer. Can't go wrong up to that point. Demon Slayer feels just a bit unique, and to me it's greatest strength is the atmospheric art + sound + animation combo that really breathes life into the demonic abilities of opponents and makes a spectacle of the fight against them. Add to this the flashback sequences we get that humanize the demons, and we've definitely got a deeper battle-shonen here than most.\",\n",
       "  '((The same as second Season without endless 8)) This is one of those strange little shows that to me; is a gem. If you start watching it, it might be rather strange because of the order that is given to you. The first episode 00 is not really the first. It’s the episode that the group makes later on in the show. A lot of shows are like that, in the wrong order. When it aired is a nonlinear way known as Kyon order. It almost makes no sense and so I suggest that you watch them in the Haruhi order which if you are lookingat Kyon order number, it would be 2, 3, 5, 10, 13, 14, 4, 7, 6, 8, 1, 12, 11 and 9. What does piss me off though is that in 2009, they added a new season, but it is supposed to be mixed in with Season 1 that added additional footage and dialogue to the story. It means that I have to rewatch the whole show again with the second season and try to put them together.\\n\\nThe feel of the show is like a Nuevo, and it’s nice to have Kyon’s thoughts on the whole idea of Haruhi’s antics. I don’t think I would be able to stand this show without his calculated thoughts and it would go into Azumanga Daioh mode I think. I really do wish I could hear more about his background and about his little sister. Every once in a while, she just seems to pop up out of nowhere and doesn’t seem to be part of anything. She could just as easily been left out instead of having her in the show. There were also times when they lost me, talking a lot about logic and philosophies in the characters who are around Kyon. I can understand when It’s Yuki, maybe even Itsuki but when Mikuru starts talking logically about time travel and then suddenly goes into ‘That’s classified’ thing, it just gets annoying because it doesn’t seem like her character.\\n\\nThe animation is pretty good, though it’s pretty much the same as almost any other school life with the rather clean artwork though they have constant hair-los even in the dark. It’s this nice little shine that went all the way around there heads. It’s a bit annoying in that aspect. The background is pretty washed out and the people stand out really nicely against it being bright. There is a lot of fan service, especially with Mikuru and the strange outfits that Haruhi forces her into. I have to say, I would have thought Haruhi would look a bit more out of control looking then what she looks like. \\n\\nThe voices in the English actually are much better in my mind but that is just my opinion. I can understand them much better if I don’t have to read the sub titles and not only that, Wendee Lee is a great Haruhi! I love her out of control voice and right next to Crispin Freeman’s cool and collected voice, it sounds really well done. Much like yin and yang. I’m not really sold on Stephanie Sheh’s Mikuru. She seems a little too timid and high pitched. It’s also nice to hear that Johnny Yong Bosch as Itsuki with a cool and collected character instead of the hot headed thugs he seems to be known for.',\n",
       "  \"Some people like to attribute Code Geass's success to the fact that it is a Sunrise mecha. Personally, I'd like to think that it succeeds (critically) despite the fact that it is a Sunrise mecha. Code Geass manages to establish a believable backdrop from which it launches a compelling plot along with motivated and realistic characters, something that has been missing from the last few Gundam series produced by Sunrise. It injects a plot where the focus is finally on the characters and the events surrounding them, rather than the machines that they use to fight. In fact, it could besaid that Code Geass only qualifies as a mecha anime due to the existence of the machines - they are in no way integral to the plot nor its development anymore than a tank or any other weapon that the characters may be using (aside from the mysterious &amp;quot;Geass&amp;quot; itself).\\n\\nGeass's plot is strengthened by its attention to detail in the geopolitical climate that the series quickly establishes from the get-go.  While the setting isn't too unique for a futuristic mecha (world divided between multiple superpowers, belligerent native populations fight to reestablish their cultural identity, etc.), the way the events are interwoven with one another sets itself up as being above the status quo.  Code Geass also manages to ask some of the questions that other futuristic plots seemingly neglect, either through purposeful avoidance or just through sheer ignorance.  From a political / sociological perspective, the setting and the development are especially engaging, posing questions on the topics of nationalism, racism, genocide, and the rules of war to the audience.  While you shouldn't expect any profoundly new ideas to arise from the series, the fact that the writers and creators did weave these ideas into the ongoing plot makes the world both more realistic as well as more theoretical at the same time, providing both an environment for the characters to exist in as well a philosophical establishment that they can debate.  \\n\\nHowever, the writers do not merely craft a beautiful world and leave it alone - instead, they focus much of their attentions, especially in the latter half of the season, towards physically and metaphysically deconstructing the world, both in the direct, tangible actions of the characters as well as the moral questions surrounding their resolve and trains of thought.  Such is the development of the actual plot of Code Geass: fluid, dynamic, and engaging.  While not entirely unpredictable, the plot's development is seamless in terms of being able to logically move from one event to another, such that the implications of a &amp;quot;cause and effect&amp;quot; paradigm can be observed.  At the same time, the plot is also not so simplistic as to be a &amp;quot;Point A -&amp;gt; Point B -&amp;gt; Point C&amp;quot; formula.  Instead, we witness the joining and interweaving of multiple, distinct plot lines, which at first glance are independent of one another, but towards the end fuse into one.  Then, Code Geass throws us a curveball, and splits the strands again, preparing us for the upcoming Season 2....\\n\\nThe greatest relative strength of Code Geass when compared to most other action / mecha anime are its characters and the way they develop.  Sunrise made the intelligent decision of contracting CLAMP to design the characters, since they are both visually and emotionally appealing to a wide array of audiences.  Internet messageboards are usually torn between the main protagonists and side characters of the story, each holding one above the others for a personal reason that they see within each one of them.  In addition, the side characters are not there merely for ornamentation - even the seemingly minor characters at the sides of the main few are given room to develop with their own storylines and reactions, such that we are never really compelled to dismiss characters as merely being &amp;quot;filler fodder&amp;quot;.  Prepare to be intrigued by these individuals - from the psychological coldness of Lelouch, to the restrained idealism of Suzaku and Kallen, to the overall question mark that is C.C.  The reactions of the individuals combine to form distinct, evolving psychological profiles, allowing the series to be populated by a cadre of multifaceted individuals.\\n\\nWhile Code Geass is extremely successful from a storytelling perspective, it does have its faults, especially on the technical side.  Plain and simple, the fight scenes were not too impressive.  That is not to say that they were awful, but the mecha and battle scenes definitely did not compare tot he fluidity of the script nor the depth of the characterization.  In addition, especially towards the latter third of the season, the plot does take a few freedoms with regards to suspension of disbelief, as well as falling into the trap of rapidly switching between &amp;quot;tragically dramatic&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;comically relieving&amp;quot; scenes.  However, these are minor problems, especially the &amp;quot;bloated plotlines&amp;quot;, which fixes itself by the end of the series.  I also would not recommend this series to mecha addicts who are genuinely more interested in awesome combat scenes between mechas, since Code Geass will not live up to your expectations.  However, for the rest of you, even if you have never considered picking up a mecha anime to watch, pick up Code Geass, it is sure to not disappoint.\",\n",
       "  \"Code Geass. Perhaps the greatest anime of all time to me. This show looks, sounds, and very simply is, amazing. Note, some small spoilers may be in here. Story: 10 Code Geass has an incredible plot. The idea was genius, and the way the played out the story worked perfectly. They brought the right things into view at the right time, and they did it throughout the whole series. When I saw the first episode, I didn't leave my computers chair for anything besides eating, and no other anime has been able to do that for me since. It was that good. Art: 10 Code Geass looked amazing,simple as that. The world looked realistic and beautiful, and the knightmares, they were on a whole new level.

       "  \"Toradora. A rather different show. But an exhilarating experience that towards the end forces you to just sit back and enjoy the ride, with all the emotional ups and downs that accompany it. While not a unique concept, the story lends itself to exquisite execution, with a masterful telling of the hazardous, yet charming journey of two unlikely lovers. Even though no drastic measures are taken throughout the unraveling of the plot, by the end you feel a certain affinity to the entire cast which you can not claim felt for many other shows. And very little will leave you with the same warmth asToradora. You cannot help but don the same wry smile which Ryuuji and Taiga commonly share.\\n\\nThe characters are an excellent mixture of quirks and shortcomings; and with a broad array as well. While Minori is warm and inviting (though odd), Ami is cold and standoffish. And then there's Inko-chan. But to focus on the two main characters is to shine every spotlight in the world on the most gleaming part of Toradora's composition. Ryuuji is fierce-looking, but the kindest, sweetest soul there could be. Taiga, on the other hand, looks like a fragile doll, yet is every bit as violent as Ryuuji looks. When the two come together, a satisfying clash is created, where a viewer can almost see the chemistry and the making of an everlasting love. An incredible warmth is felt in the viewers' hearts at every interaction between the mismatched duo.  A warmth that makes one hope for only their best, and a warmth you certainly don't want to let go.\\n\\nOn the AV front, the show manages to excel by rarely ever having outstanding QUALITY as is commonly seen these days. Whether or not Toradora was able to escape the budget shortfalls of other anime, or if its funds were more excellently appropriated remains to be seen. One thing is sure: Toradora is a visual and audial feast of which calibur will rarely be seen again.\\n\\nIn short, Toradora is a fantastic adventure through the complex rivalries of relationships, and a believable telling of the formation of a very true love. It's a show with feeling rarely felt in any sort of medium, and a show that no connoisseur of romantic anime should ever dare to miss.\",\n",

       "  'Overview: What happens when you create a series largely based on Philip K. Dick\\'s classic dystopian masterpiece Minority Report and have Urobuchi at the helm? Actually, a really kickass anime! If you are currently going through mystery show withdrawal after finishing HBO\\'s True Detective or BBC\\'s Sherlock and need more to get your fix, Psycho Pass has got you covered! Story: 10/10 The story takes place in a dystopian future where a program called the Sibyl system makes all of your decisions for you including your job, what you are going to eat, and pretty much everything else. People don\\'t have any stress because they never have tothink or have any free will at all. If you do become stressed though, the system sees you as a threat and a potential criminal in the future. You are arrested and either executed to prevent any future crimes you may commit or you can join the police and hunt down other criminals like a crime dog under the command of an elite officer that rules over you like a slave master. Crime, suicide, poverty, disease, and war are all low, but this future honestly kind of sucks! Now our squad of detectives must hunt down an enigmatic figure that is helping others commit crimes and get away with it. A criminal consultant for hire. Will our guys and gals in blue be able to stop this madman!?\\n\\nCharacters: 10/10\\n\\nThe characters is Psycho Pass are all excellent. Firstly, you have Akane Tsunemori who defies gender stereotypes and anime cliches. She is a highly competent detective with a genius IQ. She could have done anything, but chose to become a detective above all else. She has a very strong sense of justice and a kind heart, but she is also logical and not blinded by idealism. She knows for example that even a corrupt and terrible system can\\'t simply be torn down overnight and replaced with nothing if millions of people are dependent on that system. This puts her practical wisdom far above the likes of Daenerys Targaryen or either of America\\'s last 2 presidents. Another character is Shinya Kogami, who is a human hound dog bent on solving the murder of his partner and chasing the responsible party to the gates of hell. Shinya can seem cold and harsh, especially in episode 1, but he grows as a character and Akane is able to restore some of his humanity. The villain is the ever delightful Shogo Makishima, who is like Johan Liebert from Monster had a love child with Jim Moriarty from BBC\\'s Sherlock. I mention this particular adaptation of the Moriarty character because the whole \"criminal consultant\" thing was likely lifted directly from this series. The rest of the support cast as great as well, but I won\\'t describe them all here.\\n\\nArt: 9/10\\n\\nThe art in this series is spectacular. The characters and environments look great, the animation is fluid and smooth, and those guns are fucking awesome!\\n\\nSound: 8/10\\n\\nThe soundtrack is quite good. It isn\\'t the greatest soundtrack in anime history in my opinion, but it is very solid and gets the job done! Bonus points for the well done use of classical music, especially Makishima\\'s love of Beethoven\\'s 9th Symphony. Because it is never a bad time for a Clockwork Orange reference!\\n\\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\nThis series was extremely enjoyable and very addicting. Especially after Makishima is introduced. This will have you on the edge of your seat and also make you think a bit as well. It is rare when a series can combine adrenaline pumping action with great characters and thought provoking writing. \\n\\nOverall: 10/10\\n\\nThis is an absolute masterpiece! If you haven\\'t seen it yet, go out and watch it! The writing is top notch, the characters are great, the suspense and action are great, and it combines entertainment with honestly pretty decent artistic aesthetics. The first couple episodes may throw off a few viewers, but I recommend at least giving it until Makishima shows up to decide if this series is for you.',\n",
       "  \"Cowboy Bebop. Perhaps the greatest anime TV show created thus far. It's a massive mixture of genres, but is mostly sci-fi, comedy and action with a western vibe and a touch of film noir. The story of Cowboy Bebop, or the lack thereof, is probably the weakest link to the series. This series does not have an ongoing story. However, the story is NOT the main focus of the show. Each episode can stand on its own. The main focus is the immense variety of entertainment that this show provides. Many episodes are done in a different style. Some are dedicated to character development (what I callthe chill-out episodes), some are dedicated to character back-story (each main character gets about 2 or 3), some are dedicated to pure action and fun, while some are psychological thrillers or even social commentary.\\n\\nThe second main focus is the characters. Each main character is very well developed by the end of the series. It seems that the creators found the perfect kind of characters that would compliment the crew of Bebop. And what's this perfect formula? Contrast. Each character in the crew of Bebop has a very unique personality. Putting characters that do not fit together creates very interesting and funny situations, indeed.\\n\\nThe music is top-notch in this show. It ranges from jazz, funk and bebop to pop, classic rock and choir singing. Very memorable and compliments the scenes well.\\n\\nBy the time you finish this series, you will probably remember many of the times where the crew were just hanging out, living their everyday life. I think these scenes are what make the show. It wouldn't be the same without this contrast to the action throughout the show.\\n\\nOverall I give Bebop a 10 out of 10. It's extremely enjoyable; the production design is amazing, and it has lovable and memorable characters, as well as amazing music that perfectly compliments the show.\",\n",
       "  \"I have been longing to watch Studio Ghibli movies for so long, finally watched this. This animation style is so unique and completely different from any other anime movie, or series I have watched so far. The work that is put into every character is phenomenal. Would recommend it to anyone who has a love for anime and I up for a dramatic+ slice of life + heartwarming story. Loved it ♥️ The story is unique, at least I don't know any anime protagonist who is aspiring to become a violinist and a story writer. The art style is very fitting to this kind ofstory, I was so amazed seeing this kind of art style as this is my first Studio Ghibli movie. Yes the characters are well-rounded they remind me of someone I know, hence we feel real. \\n\\nI think anyone who watches this movie is going to have a hell of a treat and is surely gonna love it.\",\n",
       "  'Dr. Stone lives up to the hype and goes beyond it! The characters are very relatable and fun, especially the villagers, each with their own funny tropes. The premise is great, but the execution on it is exhilarating! Watching Senku-tachi cook up something new every episode as they leap through millions of years of civilization is just so satisfying, and the fact that it\\'s all mostly scientifically sound makes it even more amazing. My only reservation on this anime is the villain. Though I like his motive, he doesn\\'t get enough screentime and we don\\'t get enough of his \"empire\" to truly understand it. Thatbeing said, season 2 might fix this problem. All in all, IMO probably the best anime of 2019.',\n",
       "  'Look up comedy in the dictionary. If it doesn’t say “Lucky Star” there then you should write it in. Very funny and incredibly smart Lucky Star pokes fun at the most ordinary things in life, and does it brilliantly. Even though this series is a few years old, I only recently saw this on the top anime page of MAL. I was quite astounded to find that this was #130, when (judging by the anime above it) in my opinion it deserves to be much higher. And it was then that I saw the divided reviews, some giving it ridiculously low scores.So, despite it being somewhat futile, I decided to write a review on it.\\n\\nI have given Lucky Star marks based on the categories of storyline, art etc only because I had to.  To be honest, I think it is impossible to review Lucky Star in such a general way.  This is the kind of anime that comes along very rarely, one that attempts to innovate and stand out from the crowd.  The best way to define the genre would be “pure slice of life”, abrupt and somewhat in-your-face, and I think this is what unnerves some people and prevents them from opening up to the series.  It bombards you with jokes and various comedic references almost in passing.  Hence, a lot of people fail to comprehend punch lines and complain about the lack of storyline.  Unfortunately they’re completely missing the point.\\n\\nThis story is about the very ordinary lives of a very ordinary group of schoolgirls.  The style is exactly like a person reflecting upon a yesterday and laughing to himself as he remembers all the amusing things that happened.  He omits the boring parts and various unrelated conversations he had during his very ordinary day and focuses only on the funny or strange bits.  The fact that, like an ordinary person’s life, it has no over-arching storyline is the whole point of the show.  Why did I give it 10 for story then?  Basically because I believe it does what it sets out to do brilliantly, and should be rewarded for it.\\n\\nAfter watching a few episodes you tend to settle into the rhythm of the show and appreciate it much more.  The jokes themselves are hilarious, making fun of both the extremely ordinary as well as the bizarre.  Countless references to other popular anime and otaku culture also provide a source of genuine laughs.  A few heart-warming moments are also there to balance it up nicely.  Once you get into it the enjoyment factor is definitely a maximum, but this isn’t a show you can rush through.  The best way to watch it is a couple of episodes at a time, complimenting each with slices of your own life.  In fact, after watching I find it hard to go through a day without a potential Lucky Star reference.\\n\\nThe art is also top-notch.  Going for more of a semi-chibi style, it does a great job in complimenting the light-heartedness of the show.  The backgrounds are exactly that; 2d backdrops that are there to add a bit of depth to the art but nothing more.  However, this works well to compliment the simple art style and the focus on dialogue.  As well as the catchy opening theme, the hilarious and unique endings, the background music also aids the light-hearted atmosphere.  The characters are definitely the show’s biggest strength.  Each character plays a role in reflecting on another side of life, from the outright ridiculous otaku Konata to the calm, somewhat introverted Minami.  Varied and original, they really inject an energy into the anime that really makes you want to keep watching.  Add to that the talented voice actors, many of whom also did the popular The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, and loads of ironic Haruhi references and you’ve got a very funny mix.  (I definitely recommend watching Haruhi before Lucky Star so you can get these jokes.)\\n\\nThere is no question the Lucky Star is quirky and unique, and is shunned by some viewers because of this.  I am of the opposite opinion, however.  This is a show that dares to be different, and should be celebrated as a very successful experiment by Kyoto Animation.  Truly one of the greatest comedy anime ever made.',\n",

       "  'Monster anime.. Some says it is overrated, some says it is overhyped, but I don\\'t give a damn. ==WARNING; POTENTIAL SPOILERS AHEAD== This anime is strong, maybe the best atmosphere in any pyschological anime/movie I\\'ve ever watched. Call me funny, but everytime Johann monologue or dialouge appears, it gives me the cold and thrilling feels. Yes, for me, it\\'s that good. Story 9/10 I didn\\'t give the story 10 points because I think the weakest point is on the ending. Maybe some of you think that the ending is very genius, but trust me, it isn\\'t. Or maybe I\\'ve put my expectations too high (Comparing to HBO serials likeBreaking Bad, or hollywood movies that are highly rated because of it\\'s ending). But else than that, it\\'s really amazing. I told all of my friends that this is an \"HBO series in Anime\". The story is slow paced, which I really like, it develop the Kenzo Tenma characters and others (Johann, Anna, Lunge) even wider. It will never stop to amaze you, at least before the last episode of this series.\\n\\nP.S. : Guillermo del Toro, which is known as a director of HBO has submitted the live action HBO series based on Naoki Urasawa\\'s Monster. Yes, it is that good.\\n\\nArt 9/10\\nThe art is really outstanding! Well, I realized that when it\\'s the scene of Anna Liebert as child says \"Kill him, kill him.\" Wow! the face really frightening me. Or even the scene when a kid forced to walks on a local prostitution site, you don\\'t need to imagine more, because the art already gives you more than what you expect.\\nBasically, if I can compare the arts in atmospherical ways to top dark psychological thriller anime nowadays (Death Note, Pyscho Pass) I will give Death Note an 8 score, Pyscho Pass getting a 7, and Monster getting a 9. Watching Death Note and Psycho Pass or even NGE didnt give me that thrilling feels, or only disgusting feels because how much gore shown in it.\\n\\nSound 10/10\\nNow this is the part that I love the most about this anime. The soundworks is so amazing, supporting every aspect of the movie. Peaceful town? Yes. Frightening atmosphere? Absolutely. Opening and Ending? Both of them are good, especially the ending one. I still remember the ending music, and I can\\'t get it out of my head. It really match the \"Nameless Monster\" theme. Perfect.\\n\\nCharacter 10/10\\nSince there is so many characters in it, I will point out only the Important ones.\\n- Kenzo Tenma is a well developed character, you can really the way he thinks. A neurosurgery doctor, to a depressed adult young man who maybe wanted to end his own life, you can really feel what he really feels.\\n- Johann Liebert is a top class made character. Well maybe you can feel and know what Tenma thinks, but what\\'s better than that? An unpredictable ruthless monster who done his job with mindblowing ways. This character is #1 for my all time favorite characters.\\n- Anna Liebert. I hate to say this, maybe she is the weakest part of the characters section. I know she is weak and strong in a way, but his presence did not give me any new ways to see the series. Her point of view is just somewhat mediocre.\\n- Inspector Lunge, he is listed as my 3rd favorite characters on this anime. He stands to what he believes, he is a strong and realistic minded character. You can hate him, or love him, it\\'s just the matter of your point of view.\\n- Eva Heinemann is a supporting characters for me. Rather than main as what MAL shows on the page, I think she gives an impact to the show, but not that much. She\\'s just like a bridge and connects things and scenes up.\\n\\nEnjoyment 9/10\\nWhy do I only give it a 9 out of 10? Because the unimportant part of the series that really gives little impacts, or almost none which takes 5-10 episodes. I think it should add more Important stories, more like Johann\\'s raising from his dead with his sister, rather than old couple that have trouble back at the farm.\\n\\nOverall 9.5/10\\nI give it a 9.5 because nothing is perfect. For me, masterpiece is a 9, and this show is beyond it. One of the best \"Dark Psychological Thriller\" anime I\\'ve ever watch, or maybe it\\'s the best. But I remind you, that this show is not a casual show like Psycho Pass (Which I think is overrated, sorry though). This is how Dark Psychological Thriller anime should be made, call me a fanboy, maybe I\\'m just a bit overrated it, but hey, it\\'s my opinion. \\n\\nI put a 10 scores so much on MAL not because I think its perfect, it\\'s just because I just like to do so, if I enjoyed it, why don\\'t give it a free click to raise its popularity? :)\\n\\nP.S. This is my first review, please comment me on my profile :)',\n",
       "  \"This show is my all-time favorite anime because this was the first-ever anime I watched and I remember watching it as a kid on adult swim the nights before school with my brother. Story: It's the time skip from Goku as a teen to being an adult and a parent now as you follow his new adventure with the same old friends from the original DragonBall. There are many great Sagas in this anime particularly my favorites are the Frieza and cell saga. This shows so many amazing things from DragonBall from the fight scenes to the plot. Art: Honestly I really enjoy the old-styleanime since DragonBall Z was made in the 80's so it is very nostalgic for me because I like that style it reminds me of cowboy bebop and sailor moon, etc.\\n\\nI highly recommend this to people who really want to start to get into shonen anime because DragonBall has set the foundation for almost every shonen anime. Without DragonBall, I believe many of today's shonen animes could be a lot different with DragonBall setting out the Blue Prints.\",\n",

But yeah...\\n\\nOverall: Welp, I'll be kind and I'll give it a 3 because to the end it's Berserk. The whole problem here was and is the studio. The movies were much better and I'd actually enjoy watching Berserk 2016 if the same studio made it. GEMBA just please stick away from Berserk as far as you can.

       "  'If I had a teacher like Onizuka I would actually have enjoyed school and looked forward to attending every day. The show itself is good but he makes it great. For those of you who have yet to watch it, please let me try and convince you with a short review to give it a try. This is my review. Contains Minor Spoilers Story The story of GTO concerns Eikichi Onizuka, a reformed biker gang leader that strives to be a great teacher and meet chicks. The story of the teacher that reforms delinquents has been done countless times but the story of GTO feels fresh. For one,instead of taking place in a lower class public school district, the students are of a higher class with wealthy parents. And Onizuka doesn’t come from the same privileged and sophisticated background as his students and this provides an interesting comedic dynamic. The story has a few heartfelt moments that’s scattered throughout the show. The only complaint I have the with the story is that it began to feel repetitive near the end with the same “Onizuka wants to turn student’s life around but student hates Onizuka” formula being used over and over again.  \\n\\nArt\\nThe art style looks really 90’s from the character designs to the background and it fits the style and tone of the show like a glove. Onizuka has one of the most flexible faces you’ll see and it provides a lot of laughs on its own. Watch the second opening and try not to laugh when Onizuka gives the finger, I dare you.\\n\\nSound\\nSteven Blum is fantastic. He gives Onizuka an inherent goofiness and likeability but also makes him come off as cool, menacing and bad ass. However some of the voice actors sound off and don’t really sound natural. One of the students talks with a surfer accent and sometimes it’s so bad that you end up laughing. The show has one of the best soundtracks you’ll hear. Both openings of the show are excellent. Upbeat rock songs that you’ll want to listen to over and over again.\\n\\nCharacters\\nEikichi Onizuka is well known among members of the anime community for a reason. He’s funny, vulgar and caring. He looks after his students and never gives up on them. His methods can be unorthodox and he does a lot of things real teachers would never do but that just shows how far he would go for his pupils. Since Onizuka wants to help his learners throughout the story expect a lot of character development. The supporting characters are well developed but they are not nearly entertaining as Onizuka with the exception of vice principal Uchiyamada.\\n\\nEnjoyment\\nGTO is amazing. It has a lead that’s impossible to hate, a really fun soundtrack and a funny and dramatic story, even if it does start to lag during the second half.\\n\\n8/10']}"

The one thing I will say is to not look too deep into what you think show is, I've seen people saying it strays away from its 'parody' tag and saying it as a bad thing. It doesn't really parody anything for any of the main characters. Anyway onto the review none of you care about. Story - 7 ------------------------------ The story of OPM isn't a particularly deep one, nor is it that different from numerous other stories you've heard before. But it is a well told one, and a well paced one. Effectively the show from 1 all the way throughto 12 is about our hero, Saitama, fighting things and generally being unbeatable. Whilst he goes around saving the day, all the other heroes and civilians believe him to be just a normal average hero, or a fraud. This he clearly isn't to anyone who sees him, but because of his outlook on heroism he doesn't really mind not being recognized as the best. The jokes of the show come mainly from this misunderstanding, or from the gross power difference between Saitama and whatever he's fighting.\\nGood story, not anything amazingly special though.\\n\\nArt - 10\\n------------------------------\\nNow the art in this show is absolutely outstanding. The fight sequences have some of the most in depth and interesting artistry I've seen in a show. Take a look at the OPM manga, and imagine it fully animated. That's what you get here. \\nGlorious.\\n\\nSound - 8\\n------------------------------\\nThe sound for this show is brilliant. (In all honesty i don't know how sound could ever really be a 10/10, which is why this is an 8 from me.) The sound design hits all the triggers, and has lovely noises in all the right places. The fights feel heavy and epic, and the comedy feels slapstick and easy. The switches between these moments don't feel jarring, and flow together perfectly.\\nTo top it off the OP for this show is great, and will have fans shouting 'WAN PANCH' at their screens when it hits.\\n\\nCharacter - 7\\n------------------------------\\nA great selection of personalities is on show here, and they all complement each other wonderfully.\\nWe have our Hero, Saitama - A hero for fun, slapstick and uncaring; all whilst being the most powerful man in perhaps the universe.\\nAlongside him is Genos - Saitama's disciple, and cyborg enamored by our hero's greatness.\\nThen we have the collection of heroes, all vying for power and recognition. Each with a distinct ability set and personality set.\\nFinally there comes the villains, these are effectively the reflection of the heroes. The again struggle to showcase their powers, but they differ in that they all have the mad super-villain motive of - destroy the earth, kill all humans.\\nNice bunch of characters. Oh, and they're voice acted well too.\\n\\nEnjoyment - 10\\n------------------------------\\nWhereas I can admit this show probably isn't for everyone, I think most people will love it. Its an easy watch, especially if you go and discuss it with some friends after the fact.\\nYeah, if you're anything like me - you should feel the 'hype'.\\n\\nOverall - 9\\n------------------------------\\nThis is a well put together show, that faithfully adapts the source material in a way that only ever improves.\\nA must watch for anyone that likes anything, you may not love it but you should definitely give it a go.\\n\\nBaiBaiBai ヾ(^_^)\",\n",

These characters can never act like real people or else the only thread holding the plot together, that both Miyuki and Kaguya are too prideful to admit they like the other, would immediately collapse. Chika, effectively an agent of chaos, is Schrödinger's idiot: she is simultaneously an expert and utterly incompetent at reading emotions and superficially dumb while being an expert in many things. Both Kaguyaand Miyuki construct scenarios where they can trap the other into confessing their love for them, so the two can date since they are too proud to admit it themselves. Both are clever, scheming, and intelligent, well, supposedly. They concoct situations where every they have conceived every possible outcome, ensuring the other has no room to maneuver. Well, sort of. It's an excellent premise if the characters weren't so generic and the execution hollow.\\n\\nIn an early episode, both Kaguya and Miyuki pretend not to have an umbrella so they can share the other's, a staple of anime romcoms. Since both planned ahead, both pretend not to have an umbrella and now have to trick the other into admitting they have one. Kaguya walks through how Miyuki knew it would rain so he took the train rather than rode his bike, which she knows because she did not see his bike at school. Which, if Miyuki had a modicum of intelligence, would let him know Kaguya looked through the bike rack to trap him, so she too had planned ahead. But rather than have any real battle of wits, so the characters act how we're told they should be, Chika suddenly appears to offer Kaguya her umbrella. We're given a cheap way out of a poorly contrived scenario.\\n\\nThese characters can't act like real people or there wouldn't be a plot.

The womb looking thing that brought shit back to life was cool and thats about the only good relic in this whole series.\\nThe anime boasts about how many different and unique and special there are but does not show any of them or what they do. What a shame.\\nYou can make up excuses for all of these intense fundamental problems but you are the one making them, not the show. You are inserting reasons that were not present there.\\n\\nEpisode 10-12:\\nFinally the loop ends when Riko is out of the picture for a little while. The part that made you feel \"uncomfortable\" was barely anything, it was a bit edgy but I have seen much worse.\\nNanachi is the only good character in this anime. Regu is ok at best since his character is essentially \"Help Riko with shit\" and nothing more.\\nI liked these episodes the best, probably because the anime actually started explaining like a few different things? And had some character interaction that wasnt just them narrating what they were doing (Which is 90% of the dialogue in 4-9).\\n\\nEpisode 13:\\nOk so, this one was mostly good, very edgy but it was ok. I liked it up until the point where Nanachi explained her logic for wanting to kill Mitty.\\nIt literally contradicts itself. If Mitty is already gone and her responses are just \"instincts\" or \"reactions\" why does it matter if she dies?\\nIf her soul is still in there why not try cure her somehow instead? I wouldn\\'t have a problem if the logic was \"Do it because it was her last wish\".\\nBut it wasn\\'t, it was \"Kill her because shes in a cage\". If shes in a cage that means her soul is still in there and shes not just reacting on instincts.\\n\\nThe PEEdophilia in this anime is absolutely terrible. I\\'m not one that cares about nudity but this isn\\'t that.\\nThis is just sexualization for the sake of it, the constant pissing is painfully forced and would ruin the anime by itself if it didn\\'t have the other problems.\\nLiterally who is this for? Fanservice for the author and like the 1/100 people in the audience who like such despicable shit?\\n\\nIn conclusion, Made in abyss is a terrible waste of a potential story, character interactions and world building. Art is not my thing but it is good, music is fine, and that is all, and it is not nearly enough to make it worth even consider watching.',\n",
       "  'Writing a review as I sit in a hospital bed.... DEDICATION! This anime struck a sour cord for me when it finally clicked in the first episode what the setting was all about, because at that point it hit far too close to home for me, and if you must ask, yes one of my childhood friends died when I was in year 6(Last year of elementary school), only really difference is I\\'m pretty sure none of us can see her. So please be aware that there might be bias in this review, but I think my reason is justified. Ano Hi Mita Hana no Nam-. Nopefuck that. Ano Hana or The Flower We Saw That Day by the English translation is about loss at a young age and how that effects people later in life, specifically the Super Peace Busters! a former collection of some no-longer-really close friends, with our main view of the story coming from the eyes of Jintan (Only nicknames shall be used in this review) an almost prefect depiction of shut-in gamer, almost never venturing outside and when he must leave his den he does so with a disguise.\\n\\nNext in the second focal character Menma an awfully cheery little thing who loves her ramen with egg mixed in and is almost inseparable from Jintan, more would be said but that enter\\'s spoiler territory. Next on the block is my personal favorite character Poppo he is just one of those guys that everyone needs in their lives, the funny, energetic if occasionally loud dude that you meet at parties, again not much else to say without cross the line.\\n\\nFourth to the plate is Anaru who I\\'ll say is the most deliqual of everyone, hanging around (in the words of the anime) \"Crotch loose girls\", there\\'s something between her and Jintan but I\\'m not telling.\\n\\nThe fifth and sixth members of the former Super Peace Busters! I can some up in two words each for Yukiatsu, tranny and cunt (sorry but he is, at least at the start, and Tsuruko, bitch and bitch. These opinion will change over the anime but first impression are what i remember people by.\\n\\nThe art is really fluid when it wants to be and there are moments when my brain clicked \"Well that looks pretty.\" The sound is par I only give it a 10 because the piano came in when it was needed.\\n\\nThe thing that I noticed when I finished Ano Hana, apart from the standard fact that I was crying, was that it just did in 11 episode what other shows fall to do in 26, I think that feat speaks for itself.\\n\\nGoodbye my brethren, see you in the next one.',\n",
       "  \"Serial Experiments Lain seems to have left a significant mark on anime, often rated highly. That being said i found my experience with the anime rather disappointing. One of the main parts of the anime is it's horror that is especially prominent in the initial episodes. The series begins with a deeply unsettling atmosphere, haunting imagery and creepy(ish) audio. The first few episodes create a sense of unease and makes you feel like the anime will be laced with these great moments of psychological horror. However, as the series progresses the horror element disappears completely. The more convoluted the narrative seems to go, the less creepyit gets. This shift might leave fans of the horror genre feeling somewhat unsatisfied as the initial promise of psychological horror fades.\\n\\nThe voice acting is a standout feature here. The cast delivers performances that are so very monotone it's rather chilling. The lead Lain is particularly noteworthy as her subdued and almost emotionless delivery at times captures her detachment from the world around her. This monotone approach extends to other characters as well, creating a world where everyone seems slightly off and dreamlike. I should mention that i watched the dubbed version of the anime.\\n\\nThe movie is undeniably ahead of its time with it's themes of social media that feels more real today than it would watching it back then. The anime seemed to predict the impact the internet would have on society. This is impressive and adds a nice layer to the anime that is still relevant to this very day. That all being said i do believe if Serial Experiments Lain were released today, it may not be received as well. The once decent visuals and animation does not hold up against today's techniques, making it less appealing to your average viewer. I also do believe when rating the anime it's one that you really need to take into account the time of which it was released as there are so many better alternatives for anything noteworthy in this anime in my eyes. The anime i believe provides nothing you cannot find a better version of today. That being said i obviously will take into account the time at which it was released.\\n\\nThe story is full of interesting ideas, however it feels more incoherent as the plot continues. The story feels messy and rather difficult to follow thus leaves you with more negative confusion than feeling any sense of intrigue. I do not believe an anime needs to always explain perfectly what is going on and/or treat the audience as if they're stupid. However i feel the way this anime treats it's story is poorly handled and feels more like a convoluted mess than something deserving of theories and discussion.\\n\\nI also would like to mention how forgettable the characters are. While Lain herself is the titled named protagonist, the supporting cast lacks any memorable qualities. They often serve more as vessels for lain to tell a story rather than fully realised individual characters. This lack of strong character development can make it challenging for viewers to form emotional connections to a single character throughout the story. Although i only just watched the anime, i have already forgotten half of the cast. This all being said Lain is by far the most important character in the anime. Thus as long as her story was told better, i think this issue wouldn't have been as noticeable.\\n\\nOverall, the anime is a piece of history that is good in it's voice acting, ahead of it's time exploration of the web and in the earlier episodes it's horror. However, the narrative discombobulation and lack of compelling character's throughout really hold the anime back. Despite these flaws my final score will take into account the release date of the anime (that being 1998).\\n\\nFinal Score - 4/10\",\n",
       "  'Fate/Zero was the very first experience I had with the Fate franchise by Type Moon; I never played/read the Visual Novels/Light Novels nor watched anything Fate/Stay Night or Fate/Kaleid related before, so I’m not going to make endless comparisons to any other things Fate related. Just to make that clear. Also, this review covers both seasons for convenience. To be honest, Fate/Zero\\'s premise sounded rather cheesy to me at first. But I\\'ll promise you, the execution is fantastic, thrilling, and mature. That ranges from the fantastic visuals to the excellent soundtrack, the interesting and intriguing characters, their dialogues, as well as to the very well realizedfight scenes in between.\\n\\nThe story is set place in an alternate reality, in which Magis (mages) exist, magic can be studied and used to bring back old heroic personalities from across the history, such as King Arthur or Alexander the Great, to fight in a battle royal to the death with the goal of obtaining the \"omnipotent-wish granting device\" called the \"Holy Grail\", said to grant one miracle to the winner of said battle royal. This battle is called \"The Holy Grail War\" and takes place in Fuyuki City every 60 years. Seven Mages (“Masters”) are chosen, and each of them get a Servant to join the fight. These Servants are separated into seven different classes; Saber, Archer, Lancer, Rider, Assassin, Caster and Berserker. Each Servant is, as already mentioned, a Heroic Spirit from the history books, brought back to life to fight for honor and the power, which the Holy Grail supposedly possesses. After three failed attempts, the 4th Holy Grail War takes place and that\\'s where the story of Fate/Zero begins.\\n\\nThe backstory of the Fate series is huge and could literally fill books. The very first episode plays it nice and safe for everyone not familiar with the franchise and takes a 50 minute long, almost exposition dump, on you, explaining some important details about the history of the war, the main families involved in it, their connections and so on. We also get introduced to the several different Mages and get a small glimpse of what they are fighting for. While I agree that it was necessary to understand what the hell is going on, it also was one of the less entertaining parts of the show, but I personally didn\\'t have a problem with that. I\\'d rather “suffer” a huge info dump instead of having to scratch my head at everything that\\'s happening during the show any time. The story of the show flows pretty well actually and the balance between lengthy dialogues and impressive battles was handled really nicely. The cliffhanger at the end of the season was really nasty though. I still don\\'t see why this was split into two halves anyways…\\n\\nEach Servant gets a different Master of course, and each Master has different reasons to participate in this battle alongside different tactics to win it. Some are playing it out honorable in a traditional fashion and others are going on rampages with their new best friends because they can and feel like it. That makes every one of the different characters never feel really dull and especially as the cast of characters mostly consists only of fully grown adults (meaning no high school-girls, tsunderes, no token lolis and so on) very refreshing and it also includes no random fan service to ruin the otherwise serious and dark mood of the show. Fate/Zero is a mature anime but it can seem a bit “edgy” sometimes, especially as one Master is a psycho who loves to torture and kill children with his new Servant and said Master doesn\\'t really get much explanation for his behavior, other than \"It\\'s art and so coooooool!\". The characters are a mixed bag; on one hand some are intriguing and on the other hand some were barely fleshed out or just contribute nothing to the main story then sitting around and talking. I’m looking at you, Tokiomi! But my overall impression of the characters was genuinely positive though and I rooted for a lot of them. They weren\\'t perfect though and tend to act stupid at times, but nothing that would make me upset or dock a lot of points for.\\n\\nSo with being a battle royal in its core you might think that it\\'s quite obvious who is the winner because there is a main character and everything, but it\\'s really not. Yes, there are some characters that get (a lot) more screen time and dialogue than others, but among the main ones it\\'s always a struggle because every Servant and Master has different strengths and weaknesses and especially one fight between two Servants in the early parts of the show was really gripping to watch. But sadly, most battles between Servants boil down to dialogues and speeches about honor and chivalry and it makes the characters appear a bit dumb at times, when they let the enemy get away for like the 10th time instead of just finishing them off. It may be necessary for the continuation of the plot, but as a viewer it wasn\\'t that enjoyable all the time and I sometimes ended up shaking my head. But some fights between the Masters and their use of magic and weapons are where shit really hits the fan. You really feel the difference when watching the Masters and Servants fight. The Masters act a bit more realistic and out to really win the war and have their wish granted, while the Servants mostly fight in and for their honor. It makes a real nice change of pace to see the Heroic Spirits fight one another in a duel like fashion and the Masters fighting one another like it was an extermination, so the action doesn\\'t get old fast and some Master/Servant combos even have a clash of ideologies sometimes as they don\\'t agree on their methods used in the war. It was really interesting to watch how some relationships between Master and Servant didn\\'t bloom perfectly but were also spread with doubt and hatred for each other. \\n\\nSpeaking of relationships between Master and Servant... What also spiced the whole thing up more were these different interactions between some Masters and their Servants. Especially the duo of Waver and Rider made for two solid developed and likeable characters, the same goes for Irisviel and Saber. Sadly that’s not true for all of them; those two groups definitely took the cake in this first season for me. Another honorable mention goes to Archer helping Kotomine Kirei to develop as a character and changing his view on the whole situation he is in. While their interactions mostly consisted of talking and can be boring for some, I found them to be interesting and necessary to get a better view on the character of Kirei, who starts of as a pawn by Tokiomi but becomes a strong and more confident stand-alone character later on. But the character interactions didn’t just consist of the Master and Servants, but dialogues and discussions between some multiple Servants as well. They also get to talk with each other, share their thoughts and ideals – and not always for the better. For some people Fate/Zero may be too much talking and too less fighting and I would agree with those to an extent. But all in all I was pleasantly surprised with the aforementioned balance between dialogues and crossing swords this show has to offer, especially since the pacing in Season 1 is a slow, steady build-up, only to have it all tumbling down in Season 2. It was a worthy pay-off and I really loved the ending, though some scenes might confuse people not familiar with anything else Fate related.\\n\\nAnother thing which made this already well executed story even more stand-out was the great animation done by ufotable, which most notable works include the famous Kara no Kyoukai - The Garden of Sinners movie series. Everyone who saw their films know how they make an anime appealing and exciting, this is also helped by the excellent visual and sound direction the show has. The art is detailed; the animation smooth and fluent, the use of lighting and shadows brilliant and even the obligatory ufotable 3DCG looks really good. The quality got even stepped up in Season 2 and it looks even more impressive. Truly a sight to behold.\\n\\nThe soundtrack was made by Yuki Kajiura and if you already listened to a soundtrack done by her, you know how most of her music sounds; epic choirs, orchestra and so on - Fate/Zero is no exception. At some points I could have sworn I was listening to a Madoka Magica or Kara no Kyoukai OST instead, they really sound that familiar. While that\\'s a good thing to those fond of her style of music, it\\'s also off putting for those, who don\\'t like the “typical Kajiura flair” that much. I personally like her style and tracks like \"Point Zero\", \"the beginning of the end\", \"fate to zero\", \"this day, and never again\" or \"The Battle is to the Strong\" made a lasting impression on me and got into my favorites on iTunes. The rest of the audio design is fantastic as well, with good sound effects and the voice actors did a solid job as well. They really made the characters feel alive. I can\\'t speak for the English dub, but the German dub was slightly above average. To all German speaking readers: Stick to the subs please, it’s not worth the money. All in all Fate/Zero is one of the best looking and sounding anime I had the pleasure with yet, it was a feast for my eyes and ears in 1080p Blu-Ray quality. It was a great experience to say the least.\\n\\nLet\\'s get to the verdict of Fate/Zero:\\n\\nI really had a good time with this show, I like it a lot. But as much as I enjoyed the intriguing characters, the well animated fight scenes and the dialogues, it of course felt rather incomplete and the cliffhanger at the end of Season 1 left a bad taste in my mouth. I can just imagine all the disappointed faces when they had to wait for so long for this to continue airing back in the days. But I didn\\'t have that much of a problem with it. Another thing which put me off was some of the decisions some Masters and/or Servants made during important fights. If they wanted to, they could have ended this all in one season, but no. Also, some characters didn\\'t get any real light shed at all, but I think everyone will have someone to root for at the end. Another thing which could be a bummer is the extremely slow pacing at times, especially in Season 1 and compared to the very dynamic events in the \"Second Season”. In my opinion, though, that’s what makes the whole watch of Fate/Zero all the more rewarding. The first season is the slow and careful buildup while in the second one everything comes crashing down (in a good way). All in all, Fate/Zero is a fantastic anime with few misteps here and there and a rather week plot. I still recommend it to anyone looking for something a bit different from the generic moe-blobs and ecchi harems we usually get these days. It\\'s worth checking out for this reason alone. And on top of that it\\'s well made and exectued and you get an interesting story with great looking action.\\n\\nSTORY SECTION: 6/10\\nPremise 1/2 (not that mindblowing)\\nPacing 1/2 (kind of slow in S1, too fast in S2)\\nComplexity 2/2 (a lot of mindgames, intrigue etc.)\\nPlausibility 0/2 (all the technobabbling still amounts to lose rules)\\nConclusion 2/2 (great setup for Fate/stay night)\\n\\nCHARACTER SECTION: 7/10\\nPresence 2/2 (cool and strong)\\nPersonality 2/2 (well founded for the most part)\\nBackdrop 2/2 (a bit forced but fits well and rounds the characters a lot)\\nDevelopment 1/2 (only a few get it)\\nCatharsis 1/2 (overblown, but it\\'s there)\\n\\nART SECTION: 9/10\\nGeneral Artwork 2/2 (very detailed and creative)\\nCharacter Figures 2/2 (stand-out and distinct)\\nBackgrounds 1/2 (great looking, but very samey)\\nAnimation 2/2 (very fluent)\\nVisual Effects 2/2 (great for a TV series)\\n\\nSOUND SECTION: 9/10\\nVoice Acting 2/3 (solid)\\nMusic Themes 4/4 (all around great and fit the show very well)\\nSound Effects 3/3 (great for a TV series)\\n\\nENJOYMENT SECTION: 8/10\\nArt 1/1 (looks great)\\nSound 2/2 (sounds amazing)\\nStory 2/3 (lots of intrigue and the grand scale of things felt epic)\\nCharacters 3/4 (I liked and rooted for most of them, but some are weak)\\n\\nVERDICT: 7,8/10 (putting it up to 8/10)',\n",
       "  'The reason why I gave this anime a 3 is not because it’s bad, but rather because I wasn’t able to enjoy it at all. Let’s state the good points first, the art is beautiful. The music is good too, even though there are too many « interruptions » (dialogues, inner thoughts, public reactions, etc) during the performances, which can’t let you enjoy genuinely the classical music. Then, regarding the actual contents of the show : almost all the characters pissed me off, starting by the main one. It’s fiction, so let’s suppose a psychological disorder such as Arata’s is possible ; but he is whiny, indecisive, andannoying. Even thought his premise, while cliché, is not the worst and makes you want to root for him (« I’m a nice and talented guy but I’m still traumatized about something that happened years ago, and it explains why I’m absolutely not self-confident neither about music nor about the girl I like »), he’s too passive, and the way he acts towards himself and others often frustrated of disappointed me.\\nAbout the main girl, I can understand that she looks perfect because she is depicted from Arata’s point of view ; but I didn’t feel empathy towards her at all. Her behavior (I won’t spoil, but she made some important decisions revealed at the end) is well justified, but it feels too « fictionesque », too idealized. It’s not sufficient for her to look perfect from Arata’s point of view, she is also made to look perfect to the spectator. \\n\\nThese « bad » traits wouldn’t feel so awful if they were the only problem ; after all, the characters have some consistency. But all of it is intensified by the atmosphere of the show : the pace is sluggish, and everything is made to look over-dramatic. While the beginning looks light-hearted, it quickly deviates from this path. Most of the show is made of monologues, inner thoughts, and commentaries, which is really unbearable sometimes. At some point, even a simple discussion between the two protagonists can’t be « normal » anymore, and the « childhood memories » are just too much. What is more, because of this atmosphere, I wasn\\'t receptive at all to the comedy.  \\n\\nThen, the ending … I guess it’s the reason why it got such a high score on MAL. Yes, it’s a beautiful and sad ending, but it’s far from enough to make up for the rest of the show. \\n\\nOf course, it’s subjective, but the story, characters, pacing and atmosphere really suffer from the comparison to Nodame Cantabile. They have a similar premise (trauma of the main character, meeting with a peculiar girl in the first episode), but Your Lie in April is just too childish, really bad-paced, and wasted its potential ; besides, the musical dimension is just too different. While Nodame is centered about music, and actually teaches you a lot about classical, YLIA simply \"uses\" it : the characters and their relationships actually take the whole place, while music is more of a tool for their evolution and the advance of the story. \\n\\nI admit 3 is harsh (and normally, I would have given it a 5), but this score also takes into account my disappointment. I enjoy good romances, bildungsroman, and I love classical music, so I had great expectations for this show since I only saw praise about it ; but sadly I had to force myself to watch through the end.',\n",

       "  \"Shinkai's worst movie. I haven't seen them all, but I'm calling it anyway. Not a single aspect of his style works with this. Shinkai's fantastical externalization of the internal here slips into total solipsism; emotions are of such paramount importance that they are worth destroying a city and likely killing untold thousands over. That is, unless those people are part of one's found family, apparently the one class of humans deemed worthy of salvation from an apocalypse which is, as with everything, made as clean and naturalistic as possible; all its serious real-world issues sterilized and made into inoffensively beautiful wallpaper. It's genuinely misanthropic, and, evenworse, seems to have no idea that's what it is!\\n\\nThis is such a staggering misfire that I seriously wonder if Shinkai made this as an act of deliberate self-sabotage meant to destroy his own career, because I don't think it's possible to make a more scathing parody of the Shinkai style than this.\",\n",
       "  \"Just binge watched this because everyone was hyping it so hard that it was through the roof. And honestly, i don't see what's good about this. This might be one of the most overhyped anime after SAO. Minor spoilers ahead. Art is good i guess. It's not outstanding or absolutely disgusting. It's just what most anime looks like. And i didn't pay much attention to the music, but it was pretty enjoyable. I actually enjoyed the first 4-5 episodes. I thought it was gonna be something new and good. It was nice, but i was severely disappointed in the end. Main driving thing that is his powersare barely explained and barely touched. No one knows how does it work or how did he gain it.

Only to end in a rushed ending that leaves many things half assed.\\n\\nCharacters are barely introduced, it focuses on 2 characters so much that it's not even funny, sure we get a glimpse of other characters backgrounds here and there but it doesn't clear up anything. And they just leave one of those 2 characters they were focusing on after episode 8 or so only to show up at the end with someone else's kid.

       "  'The thing about deconstruction anime is that everyone in the industry wants to make one, and the only reason is because that everyone wants a slice of Utena and Evangelion. Too bad not many are able to succeed in overtaking both Evangelion and Utena. The closest i can think of is Now, Here, Then & There which deconstructs the \"another world\" genre but it still failed to make an impact to the industry & fandom like what Eva & Utena did. Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica might not be the next Evangelion & Utena, but it certainly creates the same impact to the industry in the sameway that Evangelion &amp; utena did. With great critical reception and high sales in DVDs and Blu-Rays, Madoka Magica exceeded it\\'s expectations as a deconstruction of the Mahou Shoujo genre.\\n\\nThe story is about a middle schooler named Kaname Madoka who is torn between two choices: to either be a Mahou Shoujo in order to prevent an apocalyptic event called Walpurgisnacht or to not be a Mahou Shoujo in order to save herself from the impending despair befalling her. \\n\\nIn the midst of these two choices are two people who wants her to decide: Kyubey, a cat-thingy who wants her to be a Mahou Shoujo and Akemi Homura, a Mahou Shoujo who doesn\\'t want her to be a Mahou Shoujo.\\n\\nNow, the story starts off basically as that, but as it progresses it becomes more of a Faustian retelling than a simple Mahou Shoujo story. As the anime goes on, her friends and family members became torn as she sees her friends die, her colleagues becoming witches and the suffering Madoka endured. We get to see the true nature of Kyubey, and why Homura does not want Madoka to be a Mahou Shoujo. It\\'s gets sadder, and in the end you can feel the sadness going into your heart.\\n\\nThe thing that sets Madoka Magica apart from other Mahou Shoujo anime is that not only it\\'s a deconstruction, it\\'s also a more Evangelion-esque take on the genre. This is directed by Akiyuki Shinbo who\\'s known for directing not only SHAFT\\'s greatest works, but also anime masterpieces like Nanoha and La Petite Cosette, so you get alot of influences from Nanoha, Cosette and other SHAFT works in this. It\\'s also written by Nitroplus\\'s gen Urobuchi, known for writing mangas like Saya no Ueta and Fate/Zero along with Nitoplus\\'s games like Steins;Gate and Chaos;Head. So unlike Utena, Tutu and other Mahou Shoujo deconstructions, Madoka Magica makes itself way more darker ala Narutaru or Bokurano. Urobuchi was a fan of Mohiro Kitoh, and thus you can see some influences from Kitoh\\'s works in this.\\n\\nThe art and animation is pretty good. Now, SHAFT is also known for being experimental so they also include lots of stop-motion and retro-European animation style. But due to this, you can see QUALITY animation which became the product of 4chan memes. Still, it\\'s nice to look at and it doesn\\'t have \"stop text\" like Shinbo\\'s other anime works.\\n\\nThe characters start off generic like other Mahou Shoujos, but as the story progresses they become much more interesting. Especially Akemi Homura, where later in the series you get the suffering she endures just to prevent Madoka from being a Mahou Shoujo. Her story is just heartbreaking. Madoka\\'s friend Miki Sayaka also has a good side story, seeing her becoming a Mahou Shoujo because of a promise and getting broken after that. it\\'s mean and sad at the same time. \\n\\nSpeaking of characters, the seiyuus in this are really good. Yuuki Aoi does a good job as Kaname Madoka, whereas SHAFT queen Chiwa Saito is amazing as Akemi Homura. Eri Kitamura does a great job as Miki Sayaka and Kaori Mizuhashi is also good as Mami Tomoe, a blonde but more refined version of her character from Hidamari Sketch. Nonaka Ai (Another SHAFT seiyuu) also does a great job as Kyouko Sakura. But one surprising casting is none other than Emiri Katou as Kyubey. Yes, it\\'s Kagami from Lucky Star doing a role that is definitely different from her Lucky Star days. Holy damn i was surprised and disturbed at how good she is as Kyubey. I\\'m surprised.\\n\\nThe sound is great. Yuji kajiura\\'s wonderful music creates this magical atmosphere that is present throughout this series. The OP is wonderful, i love listening to the OP. It\\'s beautiful but as the series progressed, you actually feel sadder listening to it. It\\'s one of the saddest OPs i\\'ve listened to in a while. But i don\\'t like the ED. It felt more like a rip-off of a System of a Down song. Seriously, Kalafina\\'s singer sounds like a Japanese high school girl trying to sing like Serj Tankian. I\\'ms erious. I don\\'t get why people actually like the ED. But in the end, it didn\\'t affect my enjoyment of Yuki Kajiura\\'s music as a whole, so therefore with the exception of the ED, the music and sound of this is amazing.\\n\\nOh and if you really want to enjoy watching this, do not judge this series from its first episode. Watch until episode 3, and after that you will get to know this series better. \\n\\nOverall, Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica is a well made anime that does the same impact as EVa or Utena. Whereas Utena deconstructs the Sailor Moon style of Mahou Shoujo, this series deconstructs the Nanoha side of Mahou Shoujo, and in the end it\\'s great. It gets into your heart and you\\'ll love it in the end.',\n",
       "  '5 Centimeters Per Second Review 4/10 Note: review is not spoiler free. This is for those who has already watched the anime. What really gives the anime a high rating is how the animation and the setting itself suits each other. But what brings it down is the lack of development and.....the ending. Although the movie does show that the Tohno and Akari are deeply close friends, it is the most generic way of giving two people a relationship. \"Close friends\". We never saw what deepened their friendship the most except the fact that they always hanged out together and Tohno stood up for her. So now wehave Kanae. Some random surfer girl who falls inlove with Tohno in his new school and also doen\\'s know what she should do for college. That\\'s it. She felt like just an extra character who has no purpose at all as she didn\\'t affect the main character at all. Kanae was just someone that would teach people they might not be the right one for the person they deeply loved. The rocketship scene also felt like it served no purpose except for the beautiful art, but it\\'s not enough to make up for the episode. Overall the second episode felt like it was just there and pointless. It could\\'ve definitely used to show more between Tohno and Akari instead of a new girl that would end up being forgotten.\\n\\nAnd now we have the ending. To be honest I entered the anime thinking it would end up happy. To my dismay, it wasn\\'t, atleast for Tohno. The number one thing that I hated about the ending is not because they didn\\'t end up together but because of how Tohno ended up as. My impressions on Tohno in the end is a washed up guy who  lost hope in his life and would end up alone. His newest girlfriend just broke up with him and because Tohno was still stuck in the past, he couldn\\'t move on and would quit his job wtih the thought that he was at his limit. It was certainly depressing. As for Akari, she was able to move on and marry, but had hints of regret inside her.  Overall, the anime is as realistic as real life. It is not a light novel romance anime as it shows what would really happen if it would occur in real life. It showed how long distance relationships are hard to maintain and would be a miracle if kept.',\n",
       "  \"And now presenting; Puddin’s First Review! I know a little something about superheroes, ladies and gents, and I know a little something about comedy. One Punch Man gets a looooot of love for, apparently, “doing both of these things so well,” so obviously a natural Joker like moi, was obviously going to be drawn to this after having read all of Les Mis in one sitting and had a craving for something a bit less heavy handed. Something that could make me laugh that isn’t my own jokes for once, you know? But this, this is NOT what I expected, nor what I consider a“Pioneer of Parody.” Folks, telling the same joke more than once, let alone OVER and OVER again kills it. KILLS IT. It takes a crowbar right to the gut and yanks, gnashes, tears it to shreds, until there is nothing more but a pile of viscera and doggy dinner scraps sopping wet in cold, ripe blood. Does that sound very appetizing to you? DOES IT? Because to me, The Clown Prince of Crime himself, that sounds deliberately disdainful. In fact, telling a joke more than once is quite similar to explaining the joke. And if you have to explain a joke, then there is no joke!\\n\\nAnd all of the heroes in this show? RIPOFFS! A man who can defeat anything in one punch, wears a cape, flies around, and is BALD? Excuse me, but you seem to have mish-mashed good ol’ Lexy and Supes into some horrid catastrophe of a character, and labeled him some contrived “Hero” wearing something only that total HACK Ronald McDonald would put on willingly. And people think “Satanma” or whatever his Wapanese name may be, is a hero? Must I describe to you what a hero is? I certainly hope not, there seems to be loads of them running around nowadays, you’d know it if you saw it, all it takes is some fraud wearing colorful underwear over their pants and BOOM! You have yourself a hero, listeners, and they don’t even need to have powers. Take Bat Brain and his boy-toy sidekicks of his. \\n\\nAnd what just really hurts me inside is that they didn’t even have the decency to rip him off like all the rest- the best we get is Green Tornado, Asian Cyborg, and Katana wannabe. If that type of damn near PLAGIARISM is allowed to go on further, I swear upon my mother's grave that Madhouse Studio will have earned itself a place on my hit-list, and finally live up to its name… literally! Have you seen what I can do with some paint and a little patience? I’ve transformed whole museums into art houses truly worth experiencing, how hard can a little cartoon company be?\\n\\nAnd don’t give me all of that guff about “the animation,” kiddo, because I could care less. In a down to earth sense, what matters here ain’t the look, as I’ve learned throughout my days, it’s the substance behind the appearance. There’sa aint’sa no substance’s here to be found but a poorly written aneem, partner. \\n\\nSo in short, avoid this like the plague. It neither makes you laugh nor accurately portrays all of those superpowered boners dicking around in tights. If you want superheroes, well then, put on a cape and a mask and hope I don’t kill your whole family. If you’re in the mood for a real laugh, go watch “A Serbian Film” or “Seinfeld.” Either one works!\",\n",
       "  'To Quote Mark Watney in The Martian \"I\\'m going to have to science the sh*t out of this.\" That one sentence, is Dr. Stone. Before I go any further I want to stress that the idea itself is interesting. Something happened throwing the whole world back into the stone age and then protagonist-kun arrives to save everyone with SCIENCE! Fine, Sounds like a great idea for a children\\'s educational show.... but this is clearly not meant for kids though. If anything it\\'s more of a twist on the isekai genre with the OP main character complete with a cast that does nothing but play cheerleader to him. Thisis where the show has a problem. Science is used as a catch all phrase for everything from chemistry to medicine to rocket science to astrology. It\\'s all \"science\" everything is \"science\" and since Senkuu maxed his \"science\" skill then he is obviously at PHD level in all of them... at highschool... sure.\\n\\nThe characters here are beyond weak. They\\'re so one-note it actually hurts. Tsukasa is set up as the bad guy early on with so many flags they might as well be in an airport runway. Kids shows respect their viewers more than this. \\n\\nArt is stylized enough for a few character designs to stand out but that\\'s about it. \\n\\nOverall this show is sorta empty and feels like it doesn\\'t have anything to say beyond \"Science is cool yo\" which... is sorta lame.  it\\'s not a bad show though, just.... meh...',\n",
       "  \"A biopic following a airplane designer from youth to the death of his wife and end of WWII, skipping the rest of his life. TWR is heavily fictionalized to the point where 'biopic' is questionable, which raises the question: if the point is not to depict Jiro Horikoshi's life, by adding an entirely fictional romance and death from tuberculosis, and entirely skipping over the last 37 years of his life, then what was the point, and why did Miyazaki choose animator & director (but not voice actor) Hideaki Anno to voice the protagonist? A good hint comes from the title of the excellent accompanying documentary ofthe process of making TWR and Studio Ghibli's other film-in-progress, _The Princess Kaguya_: _The Kingdom of Dreams and Madness_. Indeed, TWR is more about dreams than planes or war: it starts in a dream, ends in a dream, and the fast cuts without any dissolves or other signals or markers of time produce a dream-like effect where one never knows when a scene is set or when in the future the movie has jumped to or if one is in one of the several dreams and what in the dream is real or not. (For example, the dream with Caproni features an absurd looking multi-story multi-winged flying boat passenger plane which probably most viewers assumed was some sort of 1920s-esque parody, but the prototype of the Caproni Ca.60 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caproni_Ca.60 was very real.)\\n\\nThe documentary, to some extent, focuses on the human cost of making anime: it is a notoriously brutal career path which burns out animators, requires endless hours of painstaking labor from hundreds of people, and destroys any kind of family life. Stories abound of animators making sub minimum wage or sleeping 4 hours a day, and Miyazaki's son has written of his anger with his father for putting his anime career above his family and hardly being a father at all. (Although Goro Miyazaki comes off as a bit of an ass in the documentary himself.) All to produce some stories and entertainment, mostly for children, of dubious social value.\\n\\nIt is no surprise that Miyazaki and Anno have often expressed doubts about the value of their careers: why do they make anime? Then again, did they ever really have a choice? However much Miyazaki might vow after completing a movie to never undergo the insane ordeal again or to retire, he winds up making anime again. (As indeed, he predictably has after vowing TWR would be his last, and is working on an anime, _Boro the Caterpillar_, even now.) They can't stop, won't stop. In the lottery of fascinations (http://slatestarcodex.com/2013/06/30/the-lottery-of-fascinations/), they drew a cursed ticket. In the same way, Jiro (and it's interesting that the other 'Jiro' that instantly comes to mind is from _Jiro Dreams of Sushi_, which likewise examines the question of a normal life vs the demands of an obsession leading to greatness) 'simply wanted to make a beautiful plane'; but in that era, and even now, there is little civilian market for a fast maneuverable single-person plane - only the military needs such a thing. It was easy to make the scientist/engineer's Faustian bargain with the military: you can get the funding you need for what you want... as long as it has military applications, and you don't mind selling your soul or having to witness the consequences. (Admittedly, most who make that bargain don't see it backfire as quickly and spectacularly as the Japanese did.)\\n\\nThe intended conclusion, presumably (given the bizarrely abrupt non-ending), is that expressed by Baron Caproni, when he analogizes war-making planes to the pyramids of Egypt: as terrible as the human cost to build them was, their greatness and immortality were worth it, and the world is the better for them. One can quibble about the facts there (archaeologists apparently regard the pyramids as built by a largely voluntary labor force in the Nile's off-season where agriculture was not possible, which given Malthusian conditions might not've affected standards of living) but the analogy falls flat: I don't wind up convinced that there was anything particularly beautiful about the Zero, much less any enduring eternal beauty which could justify contributing to so many unjustified wars. Jiro and the other should have, like the proverbial Chinese scholars, declined to serve an evil emperor and retreated to the hills to await a better regime to serve while they tended their gardens. Even after two watches, the rationale comes off as weak despite all the soap opera histrionics. And while the use of Anno as a voice-actor is an intriguing art-mirroring-life choice, ultimately Anno is something of a disappointment in going through the movie in a pleasant monotone. (You can also listen to Anno voice-acting in the _Evangelion_ Addition audio-drama, and to interviews of him like _Hideaki Anno Talks To Kids_ to confirm that he voices Jiro as himself, essentially; I'm always surprised how high-pitched Anno's voice is for such a relatively big guy.) Indeed, the plot and pacing overall are deeply unsatisfactory, and I think I liked the movie considerably less after rewatching it, as all the flaws became much more obvious on a rewatch: frankly, it's kind of boring! Actually, I would have to say that the documentary about TWR, _Kingdom of Dreams and Madness_, was much more interesting than the movie itself...\\n\\nSo the message falls flat. What was good about it then? I would say: the opening dream-flying sequence is indeed lovely in the same way as _Ponyo_'s ship &amp; water animations; the earthquake sequence, though brief, is also good; there are occasional parts of interest in the plane designs and the Caproni dream sequences. Overall, I would rank this as above _From Up On Poppy Hill_ (with its egregiously awful plot twist) or _On Your Mark_ or _Only Yesterday_ (and maybe _The Cat Returns_) but well below the Miyazaki classics like _Castle of Cagliostro_ or _Whisper of the Heart_ or _Ponyo_ etc.\",\n",
       "  \"There some mecha's that achieve near brilliance, and others that are rendered useless in their awkward failure. Code Geass is neither of this. I started Code Geass as soon as the first episode aired.. Yes, I have enjoyed it very much. But to my surprise, on the arrival of the 13th episode, Code Geass took the anime industry by storm. Like a moth to a flame, people crowded the anime and simply worshiped it(God knows how many CC fans are being born as of this moment). Much as Ive enjoyed Code Geass, it does not do justice to be considered what it is today. Infact I feel its popularity is similar to FMA, both are highly enjoyable but nowhere near being the masterpiece people claim it to be.\\n\\nCode Geass is not a sight to behold, but rather a sight to gather thousands of fans within only barely dozen of episodes. Spectacle, after all, is Code Geass specialty, not subtlety, so enjoying the sum of the parts sometimes requires dispassionate detachment or at least blind belief. But whether you think Code Geass is absurd or lacking originality, Code Geass is one of the most fun and engaging anime's in recent memory, as long as you don't think about it too hard.\\n\\nJapan, being defeated by the empire of Britannia, whose territory reaches nearly one third of the world thanks to their high-tech war machines called Knightmares, was renamed to Area 11. Britannia swiftly depraved the Elevens(Japanese) of their pride, rights and isolated them from the migrating citizens of Britannia, leaving them to poverty.\\n\\nThis is where our main boy steps in. Lelouch, a young former prince of Britannia who was known to have passed away, not to mention a cheap ripoff of Light Yagami from Death Note.  During a battle between the Britanna and a scarce amount of rebelling Elevens, Lelouch finds a capsule containing a naked woman, who gives Lelouch Geass, a mysterious ability that can control any human simply by looking them in the eyes and speaking his commands. And because that it just so happens that Lelouch has this great animosity for the Brittania, he plans to single handedly face the tyrant. \\n\\nLelouch under the alias of Zero, becomes a hope to the elevens and a threat to Britannia.\\n\\nIts hard not to compare Lelouch from Yagami Light of Death Note. But if you can get past it, you'll find out something more. Coming with a tragic past pre-installed, it may seem that Lelouch is your typical apprehended teenager(Gundam anyone?). But Lelouch in a way, is a revenge-driven genius who would dare to go against the world to reach his goals and doesnt endlessly desires to just die without a fight.  He even has the discernment for seizing control of the situation and directs the terrorist group by radio, controlling them and anticipating the moves of the Britannian forces like it was a game of chess.\\nIt isnt entirely plausible how is still able to manage a double life and lead the Japanese to victory. But it does provide Lelouch moments to look more sympathetic and less unrealistic.\\n\\nSo yeah thats pretty much what you need to know. Lelouch battles Britannia with the help of the ever so gullible and disposable Japanese. Oh and I forgot to mention Suzaku,an Eleven who is his childhood friend, siding to Britannia. They both basically the want the same thing, only they have different methods. Lelouch wants to rid of Britannia to make the world easier for his sister to live in, Nunally. Suzaku, on the other hand, wants to climb the ladders of Britannia, and gradually change it to good from the inside. \\n\\nThere's a ton going on in these first five episodes, and the pacing is rapid-fire.  Add in a truly epic stage, some awesome battles, and just a dash of comedy to keep things from getting too dark, and it's really hard to see where this show can go wrong from here. \\n\\nCode Geass is majestic, in terms of entertaining. The plot twists are so twisted that it becomes endless and absurd. Every episode ends in marvelous cliffhangers that can make you get a garotte wire and strangle yourself for an entire week until the next episode comes out and makes you do the same thing all over again. It just keeps getting better and better.\\n\\nThe actions are also a treat. From assault to massive warfare, Code Geass is impressively detailed. The contest between Britannia and the Eleven are as breathtaking as they are thrilling, while the individual battles are supremely well choreographed.\\n\\nCode Geass has so many things working in its favor that it becomes easy to overlook some of its flaws.\\n\\nThe animation is completely convincing and fulfills the shows &amp;quot;mecha plausibility&amp;quot; quotient well besides than the roller blading war machines. Moreover, few if any prior shows have as effectively integrated the tacky yet refined movements of the robots as they do here. CLAMP did the designs here so be sure to expect it to be excellent(and have arms, which have uncanny ability to stretch an extra three feet)\\n\\nThe music is fluid. It always depicts the sound perfectly. Be it a gunshot or a whole building crumbling down, it is nicely executed. The background effects are also a plus. You get to hear a bunch of insects flying around or birds chirping.\\nIt gives a rather credible atmosphere partnered by a perfect atmospheric melody. The clarity of the sound effects definitely supports the anime very well.\\n\\nVoice acting is no slouch either. It can easily persuade you of the emotion of each characters tries to convey, even supporting characters are given enough to time to emote.\\n\\nThe results are predictably impressive, even genre-defining. However as good as Code Geass is in terms of spectacle, the show does hit a few dud notes in terms of plot and characterization. But put together with visual flair, it&amp;rsquo;s a winning combination that helps to ensure Code Geass is a roller coaster experience of thrilling intensity.\\n\\nJust like Da Vinci Code, it is &amp;quot;preposterously entertaining&amp;quot;.It is safe to say that anyone who's interested in action or mecha will go bananas over Code Geass.\",\n",
       "  'Goddamn, last season was heavy on the shonen/superhero stuff, wasn\\'t it? Seraph of the End: Battle in Nagoya. Ushio and Tora. Noragami Aragoto. And of course, the most popular one of them all, One Punch Man. It\\'s going to be difficult to find something new to say about each of them, but lord knows I\\'m going to try my damndest to do so. Might as well start with the one that got everyone\\'s attention, even if not for all the right reasons. I mean it\\'s a giant understatement to say that I wasn\\'t the only one who watched One Punch Man, but it\\'s also abig understatement to say that I wasn\\'t the only one who wasn\\'t impressed with the thing.\\n\\nIt\\'s even worse in my case, because I don\\'t get shonen action as substance at all. I don\\'t hate it, and there was a time when I enjoyed pretty much everything that came out of Shonen Jump\\'s mouth the same way I enjoyed Marvel v. Capcom, but you\\'d think the genre would grow up along with the audience and focus more on substance rather than repeat the same outdated Dragonball Z-style over and over again because holy hell did we not get sick of that ten years ago. But with the explosive popularity of One Punch Man along with David Production continuing to make more bloody adaptations of Jojo, I think it\\'s pretty clear that that isn\\'t going to happen anytime soon. So who cares if the plot is weak? Who cares if the satire goes for all the easy shots? Who cares if the characters don\\'t have any real struggles or flaws or story or anything going for them besides how they look and a stupid name? It\\'s a popcorn anime, and it\\'s very good at what it does.\\n\\nExcept even by the standards of popcorn anime, I\\'m not sure it does. I mean you have the director of Space Dandy and the production values from Madhouse on this project, so obviously you\\'re going to get a great-looking show. With that said, why is the action so fucking bad? Every time it showed up, the camera would spin around or zoom far-out whilst characters threw massive explosions at each other or delivered a punch in a desperate attempt to make it look cool when in reality, it looks overblown and retarded. There is absolutely no choreography being applied to any of the action and it becomes really boring to watch as a result. And even if there was, it is an absolute cakewalk to determine who\\'s going to win the fight before it even starts because the whole show is built around Saitama saving the day in his own dry way with nobody in the entire universe being close to his level in terms of fighting prowess. Add in the fact that nobody really dies in this show anyways but the one-off characters who have less charisma than a Marvel villain and there\\'s a limit to how much tension One Punch Man is allowed to have in regards to its fight scenes (i.e. zero).\\n\\nNot helping is the fact that Saitama is an incredibly boring character who has no depth to him besides one joke: he\\'s a normal dude who became the strongest in the world by training really hard and is bored with his life as a result. Every other hero in this show became powerful through genetics or body modification, and as such don\\'t believe Saitama when he says that he just worked hard, nor do they trust him because thanks to his lack of brains, he\\'s lowly ranked in the Hero Association. This could have made for some interesting conflict, but One Punch Man never really treats Saitama\\'s invincibility as anymore than a cheap joke or a deus ex machina trying to be a cheap joke, no thanks to the other heroes having zero chemistry with the dude and making DC\\'s good guys look like Marvel\\'s. Aside from a cyborg whose only real purpose in life is to lose so that Saitama can have someone to save, I can\\'t recall a single time he\\'s ever had a real conversation with anybody. Hell, I\\'m pretty sure Genos has had more overall screen time than him.\\n\\nAnd don\\'t even get me started on the villains in this thing, who make Marvel\\'s bad guys look like DC\\'s. I can\\'t even remember anyone\\'s name, let alone what they added to anything. There was some attempt at making the final bad guy an \"invincible contrast\" to Saitama, but it was so poorly handled it made the relationship between Spiderman and Green Goblin look like Batman and The Joker - and I still didn\\'t bother to remember the dude\\'s name afterwards. Word of advice to anyone creating a bad guy: Marvel\\'s villains are absolutely awful! Nothing but a bunch of random animal or element gimmicks applied to some misguided fool trying to overcompensate for the fact that Mad Hatter has them beat in the character department. But you know what\\'s worse than that? Actual animal or element gimmicks fully realized in physical form, without even an attempt to make them realized as actual characters.\\n\\nAll of which could have been forgiven if the show was funny, as One Punch Man is supposed to be a comedic satire on the shonen action/superhero genre. Thing is, the show only has one joke (Saitama being Saitama) and said joke never made me laugh. Not once. Which would already have been a giant problem by itself, but the fact that the satire sucks too does it no favors. And not just because it goes for all the easy shots, but said shots are even misaimed a few times. There\\'s one moment in the show where Saitama makes himself out to be the bad guy in order to save face for the other heroes due to some random jackass who apparently never appreciates anything in his life, but it falls incredibly flat because it\\'s incredibly obvious it was done so that the show can repeat its one joke. Not one single person was buying the jackass\\'s bullshit, so there was no reason for Saitama to do that, especially since it\\'s never brought up again afterwards. It\\'s an extreme, but by no means the only part of the show where it\\'s clear the writers have no ambition for this show beyond taking cheap potshots at a genre that has been satirized so well in the past.\\n\\nLet me make it clear that One Punch Man is by no stretch of the word \"bad\". It knows what it wants to be and does it well, even if it wants to be is nothing higher than mediocre at best. Because if we\\'re judging it in comparison to the rest of the shonen/superhero anime that aired in Fall, One Punch Man is the worst of the shonen action anime that I have seen. Good visuals can only take you so far, and whilst I commend Madhouse for keeping the quality high for most of its run, thirteen episodes is a long time to watch something that has little to no substance. Hell, the specials don\\'t have anything noteworthy about them visual-wise, leaving you with nothing at all.\\n\\nMy advice to you guys? Watch Concrete Revolutio instead. And no, I\\'m not going to stop sucking Concrete Revolutio\\'s dick until more people admit they were wrong to abandon it for the much weaker Sunday superhero show.',\n",
       "  \"Having watched this right before I'we written this review, I didn't know what to expect. Then the first frames came in. Whoa! WHOA! OH MY JESUS! This is it! This is how you make cell animation in 2008! I can tell ya, NOTHING EVER was this beautifully drawn before! I don't think I was even breathing during the second story! It easily puts every other cell animated title to shame(ONLY in terms of animation), and will be the only thing for YEARS to come that will deserve a perfect score. For how it is drawn, naturally. For in every other aspect, 5 Centimetres per second is a mixed bag. Wehave one story going back and forth on the line from stupid to beautiful. One that is exactly how the entire feature should have been, and one that's just plain moronic. But let's go with the airing order, shall we?\\n\\nThe first story: I don't really know. Sure, it's anice little topic, lovers seperated and all, but it seems as if common sense would be cast aside for drama. How is it, that in the present day, two people who are in love with each other but seperated still communicate by mail? Why does it take a train trip to get the idea of using the telephone to keep in touch? Why does the story give us the illusion that the meeting itself solved anything when later on it disproves itself? Sure enough, the train trip felt agonizing at times (a HUGE plus), but it was just a bit too melodramatic. So like I said, I can't really put it anywhere.\\n\\nThe second story: HELL YEAH! Now this is romance! I don't know how the show manages to make the viewer forget that the imagery plays a huge part in conveying the overall tone, but it does, and you just sit back, and enjoy a rendition of a girls emotions that is so beutiful, and most importantly, so REAL(unlike 90% of everything else in this regard), you instantly forgive life for failures like Tokikaku. This story has a heart, this story has a soul, this story is so much better then the other two, you would have to think it was written by a completely different person! The best of the bunch, hands down!\\n\\nAnd so, we arrived at story three, the train to real life will leave from here in ten minutes, we apologize for the inconvenience.\\n\\nEver been on a roller coaster? Harken back to the time when you were on it first, the mesmerizing felling of climbing ever higher and higher, until the point where you reach the top, and suddenly, you realise that you don't really want to go down, but you will anyway, and besides, it's the only way to get back on the ground. Not to mention that you can't do anything about it. Now imagine that suddenly, while you are at the top, the roller coaster crumbles undernath you, and you plummet to your doom at terminal velocity until you stop sixteen feet under ground leaving a crater big enough to fit the entire roller coaster in. This is as close as you will come to the experience that is the third story, something for wich the person who gave the green light for it's enclusion should have his/her lungs exposed to ridiculus amounts of Zyklon B. It tryes, and HOW it tryes to give a fitting aftermath to the first story, but the degree it fails at this makes you question the sanity of the mind that ever thought of it's creation, let alone inclusion! It haphazardly introduces new characters for no known reason, and succeeds in making (at least) the main character look like a totally unrelatable, ununderstandable retard by not only having him NOT living in contact with his girl, but rather getting a new one, WHITOUT SEPERATING HIMSELF FROM THE FIRST ONE, AND BEING ANXIOUS ABOUT IT! Basically any bit of common sense that was gathered for these characters in the first story goes out the window so fast, you wonder why there was any reason giving them any in the first place. Plus, it doesn't solve anything! It's Bullshit with a capital B (no, better, a backwards b, a d), and ultimately pulls the production down into mediocre junk territory for making everyone believe that the characters of the first and third story are the real focus of the story, completely overshadowing the brilliant second one. (Thankfully, it's barely ten minutes long, so it can't detract from the value of it's prettyness and it's middle.)\\n\\nOh, and if you are going to have a male solo artist singing the end theme of your show, make sure you get one that doesn't sound like me when drunk and trying to parody sing(this goes double for L'arc en ciel).\\n\\nNo wait, Japan doesn't have any of those.\",\n",
       "  \"Unfortunately, the movie that introduced 'mainstream' America to Miyazaki is not as good as it has been advertised. Story: The story itself is rather underwhelming; a small spoiled brat is 'spirited away' to, well, the spirit world, her life as she knows it is suddenly in danger, and she has to overcome her selfishness in order to get back to her world, all the time helping and being helped by an attractive young male spirit who is actually a dragon...did you catch all the cliches in there? Art: This is the movie's one saving grace. Miyazaki was always known for his fantastic animation, and Spirited Away isno exception. The scenery is breathtakingly realistic, and despite the two-dimensional characters, could almost be mistaken for live-action if one were to not be careful. \\n\\nSound: The music is relatively bland; no really noticeable or memorable moments in the score. For once I prefer the sound effects to the actual soundtracks. It is also worth noting that the voice actors usually speak all their lines with one monotonous emotion. This is not inherently their fault, though, as will be explained in the next section.\\n\\nCharacter: The movie's weakest point by far. None of the characters are likeable, except the minor ones, and maybe the animals. Sympathy for Chihiro doesn't really grow as the movie progresses, which is no doubt the opposite effect the filmmakers wanted. The spirit Haku is also an offender here; as cool as we are supposed to think he is, this is hindered by his all-around boring-ness.\\n\\nEnjoyment/Overall: In the middle of recording this for my family to watch later, I had to just cancel it after realizing how disappointing the film was. What was I expecting? Well, maybe a movie that had a storyline that was taken further, characters that actually develop and manage to be likeable, and an interesting musical score. Is that too much to ask? If you haven't already fallen prey to Miyazaki mania with this one, I would say just skip it. Not missing much.\",\n",
       "  'One of Studi Ghibli\\'s finest movies. The tale of the princess kaguya or \"kaguya-hime no Monogatari\" is a beautiful story about responsebility, what it means to be human, and finding yourself. Quoting Imdb plot synopsis \"Found inside a shining stalk of bamboo by an old bamboo cutter and his wife, a tiny girl grows rapidly into an exquisite young lady. The mysterious young princess enthralls all who encounter her - but ultimately she must confront her fate, the punishment for her crime.\" This movie doens\\'t look like typical anime style, instead they\\'ve chose to draw it with watercoloring, which gives it a soft andsmooth look. It isn\\'t overly detailed, it used a variety of beautiful colors in unconventional ways. Sometimes they even change the style to reflect a character\\'s state of mind. The animation is one of the best I\\'ve ever witnessesed, and apperently it took over 5 years to draw, and that paid off. The story is simple enough allthough it manages to be though provoking and very sad. The movie shows the variety of all humans, greedy, jelous, caring, narcissistic, sad, happy, and so on. The movie reflects on if it\\'s worth being human with all our negative emotions, or if it\\'s better to not remember anything. To quote Kaguya: Just a little longer, to feel the joy of living in this place\". We all experience emotions, bad and good, and Princess Kaguya gets to experience what it means to be a human, but does she really belong in this world? \\nOne thing I got to point out other than the BEAUTIFUL animation is the music which is incredible, just incredible. My favorite scene from the movie includes a couple flying over a field of flowers, which is just too amazing to be real. The tale of princess kaguya is very sad, beautiful and a very good movie.',\n",
       "  \"Sophie is your average teen girl living a mediocre life with no purpose - Unlike her beautiful sister, whom she envies within her soul, she is rather plain and her measure of self-worth suffers for it. One day, she encounters a dashingly handsome man. He saves her from the leering of soldiers. He steals her heart with a graceful display of his abilities. Almost suddenly, her life has taken a magical turn!First off, let it be said that this is an INCREDIBLY SUBTLE film. \\nIt is highly unlikely that you will understand it in one sitting - I had the film fly right over my head and was left in disappointment by what I had then perceived to be weak writing on Miyazaki's rendition of the classic YA novel by Diana Wynne Jones.\\n\\nThink Chekhov's Gun when it comes to (almost) everything here - why a character makes an otherwise confusing or obvious remark; why were you shown a shot of someone doing something otherwise ordinary. The trick here is to notice these key moments of foreshadowing or revelation in all the deepest throes of gorgeous eye-gasm. \\n\\nThen think outside the box. With enough contemplation you will be able to see beyond the surface themes of this work of art.\\n\\nStory: 8/10 \\n\\nThis is a story about revelation, perspective and acceptance. Its subtleties are truly subtleties - Miyazaki seems rather unafraid of having his audiences miss something utterly crucial to the interpretation of the plot.\\nThemes dance across the surface of the water but never really submerge the viewer into its depths unless the viewer has had time for contemplation.\\nThe pacing is good but not stellar - there are minor hiccups here and there which are inevitable given the source material. My biggest gripe is the abrupt closure of some issues at the end.\\n\\n\\nArt: 9/10 \\n\\nFrom the hand-painted landscapes to the marvel of the Moving Castle, from the expressions of characters to the non-expression of things, Howl's Moving Castle is a technical masterpiece of 2D animation.\\n\\n\\nSound: 6/10\\n\\nWhile the sound and music are decent they do not add something to the show nor necessarily express a part of the show well.\\n\\n\\nCharacter: 7/10\\nCharacter designs are strong in the leads, however some individuals never really achieve any level of depth.\\n\\n\\nEnjoyment: 7/10 \\nWatch and you will no doubt be enthralled by the magic of Miyazaki's craft and his ability to tell stories about the human condition - Howl's is a departure from his usual flavouring of film and has elements of its source work permeate its atmosphere in quiescence.\\n\\n\\nOverall: 7/10\\nHowl's Moving Castle is a nuanced film with amazing animation that is not afraid to be sophisticated. It has strong rewatch value (even more so than his other films) and tackles some psychological aspects inherent in all fictional works with mercy and finesse.\",\n",
       "  \"The story seemed great at the beggining but all become into a dumpster fire when more lolis appeared in the show, and that's when I realized the characters have no chemistry between the viewer and the show. I can't feel anything for any of them. Sorrey waifufags but as a woman I can see the things in a more clear way. Okay, besides annoying lolis, this show also has a team rocket, who appeared every fucking episode doing some boring shit like bullies that run away when the good guy solves everything or btfo them. Also the fights were so boring as hell, art wasclose to zero. I mean okay, iron maiden's appearance was great but the rest of the fights? trash (no, not you trash, the other trash). \\n\\nMoving onto the art, awful awful cgi, the parts that were supposed to look amazing were laughable the most part of the time, I can't believe I loose my time watching this show. Godzilla vs. Giant Bird was the cherry on the cake. The tense got lost and instead it made me laugh so hard and also I felt ashame of watching the show.\\n\\nCharacters, ok, I may have a problem, but I DISLIKE Raphtalia's character, unlike people that loves her character just because muh waifu raccon, muh loli, or waifu 1dimensional seasonal bait, I do dislike her. I used to think about her as a meh character when reading the manga and reading some WN spoilers but anime made her dirty specially in her character focus episode. \\nNaofumi, was well, at the begginig I felt pity for his fate and also maybe wanted him to find happiness BUT the show made me change my mind once the show advanced, OP shield? really? OP powers REALLY?! okay man I guess you don't need help much less the help of Raphtalia aka your sword since you have too OP powers, huh? well, have a happy life, you are not interesting anymore since also seems you forgave trash and slut for making your life miserable (at least at the beggining). \\n\\nThe rest of the characters are forgettable, I don't even remember well the name of the rest, I guess, I need to reread manga and try to read the LNs...At least the characters were more enjoyable in the manga.\\n\\nThe sound, well, I guess is okay. i heard the guy in charge of the ost was the same of MiA, yeah I guess that could be possible but definitely his work here was way too inferior from his work in MiA.\\n\\nTo sum up, If you want to loose your time and think watching a raccon girl is worth your time or maybe if you are a furryfag, slavefag, waifufag, etc. This show is for you. You won't be dissapointed. Also, what about taking note of this: That tight raccon girl is a 10 years old  girl who also wants to impress her benefactor (her owner) by wearing swimsuits and making sandwiches. (That reminds me of a certain mary sue...)\",\n",
       "  \"I'm not a big shonen follower. I dislike long anime. Yet Hunter x Hunter, from the creator of Yu Yu Hakusho, managed to sneak its way into my top 5 anime of all time. Imagine a shonen series where the main character, a young boy, does NOT start out as a complete idiot who knows nothing trying to be the best trainer/ ninja/ fighter in the whole wide world. Our hero, Gon, from the first episode is already skilled, patient and persistant. He is young, boyish and naive but never annoyingly so. And his aim, reflecting his character, is pure and simple; he wants tomeet his father, who he's never met.\\n\\nRather than beginning with long boring training scenes, Hunter x Hunter gets straight to the point and starts with the action filled Hunter's Exam. Well, it does take a few episodes to really get there, but as other reviewers have suggested, please give this series a chance through the first few, at least five episodes. Yes, the artwork is a bit dated and it's a bit cheesy and Gon makes animal friends. Skip the first few eps if you must. The real treat is coming.\\n\\nThe Hunter exam is not like anything you've ever taken at school before. And it certainly doesn't rely overmuch on simple muscle or physical strength. So you're not going to see boys beating each other up, moving on to the next bad guy, lather rinse repeat, oh no.\\n\\nThe Hunter Exam is about testing it's contestants, psychologically and physically. It forces them to form friendships to complete certain tasks, then pits everyone against each other, about giving choices where each choice is more deadly than the last and choosing not to choose is a gamble. Some episodes have a lot, and I mean a lot of clever dialogue and talking, while others are more action based. It's overall quite a smart series, and rather dark; people die (and stay dead) and good doesn't always triumph. In fact, some of the most morally ambiguous people and situations you may ever encounter take place in this series.\\n\\nOne of Hunter x Hunter's strong points is it's cast of characters. Not only do our main 4 boys have strong, three-dimensional personalities but so does every other character on the show, from old family friends who appear for a few episodes or recurring characters that appear ever so often.\\n\\nWe have Killua, the fan favorite, a white haired, sometimes angsty teenaged boy who is actually an assassin from a big, famed, filthy rich family of assassins. (Just wait till you meet his family). Killua is blunt and sarcastic, basically Gon's foil.\\n\\nKurapica, my favorite character, is another story. Aloof, proud, collected, highly intelligent and harboring plenty of dark secrets, Kurapica is the brains of the operation, getting them out of plenty of tight spots where muscle just doesn't cut it. But as you soon find out, it's not that he lacks muscle or fighting skill. \\n\\nAnd then we have...Leorio. At first glance you may wonder why he's really even there. He spends most of the series lagging a bit behind his younger friends.He's really just an average guy and provides a lot of the series humor. Though some people consider him to be an extra addition that doesn't make sense, I think the series just wouldn't be the same without him. Somewhere in the midst of all the insanity this average guy barely keeping up with them just works. \\n\\nReally it's the characters that pull this series together, from the ever talkative ninja, to the Hunter Examiner without a mouth (who nevertheless talks a plenty), to the evil Hisoka who delights in finding those challenging enough to kill to the deranged family of assassins. Everywhere you turn is a new, interesting character, some of them more unique and original than many main characters in other series.\\n\\nSo overall, if you're looking for a solid anime that isn't regularly interrupted by filler, features great battles, great characters, dark, gritty artwork and smooth animation then Hunter x Hunter is for you.\",\n",
       "  \"Overview: I'm currently on a quest to watch every Miyazaki movie and I'm almost done. Miyazaki has the highest batting average of any writer/director in anime as far as I'm concerned. I guess it was inevitable that eventually even he would swing and miss. This is the beautifully animated mess called Howl's Moving Castle. Background: Firstly, Miyazaki is at his very best when he writes his own material and creates his own original stories. He has shown he CAN do brilliant adaptations like Kiki's Delivery Service and Castle of Cagliostro, but the source material needs to mesh well with his own writing style, preferred themes, and tone. WithHowl, Miyazaki decided to adapt a very mediocre children's book and force his own unique quirks and traits into it. It just felt like a square peg being hammered through a round hole. It was also 2004, so Miyazaki changed the script halfway through production to shoehorn in a war sub-plot that wasn't in the novel and doesn't remotely fit the narrative and tone of the novel. Come on Miyazaki! I know you were mad about the Iraq War. We all hate the Neo Cons. This didn't fit in a children's story with an absurdist plot that ONLY worked because it didn't take itself seriously! This felt as wildly out of place as inserting Glenn Greenwald's anti- US Imperialism diatribes into Green Eggs and Ham.\\n\\n\\nStory:\\n\\nHowl is an elusive wizard who lives in a moving steampunk castle. Everyone tells terrible rumors about him, but it's all bullshit. He's actually a nice guy for the most part, just a bit selfish and cowardly. Our heroine is a young hatmaker named Sophie, who is cursed by the evil Witch of the Waste to have the body of an old woman. Even worse, the curse makes it so she isn't allowed to tell anyone her true identity. Sophie journeys into the Waste to find a way to reverse the curse and ends up stumbling upon Howl's castle. She decides to just start living there and offers to be his cleaning lady, which he accepts. Howl is constantly running from the Witch of the Waste because he once was in love with her beauty, but left when he realized how evil she was. She has been doggedly pursuing him in order to steal his heart...literally. This was all from the novel. The first half is a straightforward adaptation that improves upon a lackluster story by adding Miyazaki's trademark playfulness and sentimentality. \\n\\nNow we start the 2nd half and everything goes to shit. Howl is called by multiple countries to turn himself in and transform himself into a monster to be used in a massive World War. This war is being orchestrated by Howl's evil former teacher, who wasn't in the book. She wishes to drain other witches and wizards of their powers and transform them into monsters to create a glorious war. She has no clear plans for global domination like the villain in Laputa, she just really loves war I guess. Howl ends up sending Sophie to meet this evil lady and she drains the Witch of the Waste (the actual villain from the book) of her powers and relegates her to comic relief. Howl ends up swooping in to save Sophie along with the Witch of the Waste and evil Warmonger witch's dog...for some reason. Howl is slowly transforming into a monster, but this is never really explored and leads nowhere. The Waste Witch tries to steal Howl's heart and Sophie ends up inexplicably risking Howl's life to save the evil bitch. Then Sophie falls into a canyon and inexplicably survives. She finds a random door which leads into the past, so she can see how Howl gained his powers. She then pops back to the future and finds Howl there injured but alive. Howl gives up his powers to restore his heart and the Warmonger witch, who has apparently been spying on them via the dog, just randomly decides to end the war and give up. The End.\\n\\nCharacters:\\n\\nSophie is easily the worst Miyazaki heroine. She starts the story wise and resourceful. She doesn't have a character arc to complete. She doesn't really have any interesting traits or characteristics. Howl starts off with very clear flaws, but his journey to fix those flaws is horribly executed because the 2nd half of the film is a beautifully animated, explosive taco shit. The Witch of the Waste was clearly evil and then after getting her powers drained becomes a senile goofball. The warmonger witch just turns good out of fucking nowhere for no reason. I know Miyazaki wanted to have a pacifist theme, so he didn't want a traditional violent confrontation with the villain. That worked in Princess Mononoke because the antagonist was clearly established as morally complex and not simply evil. Howl is like if the villain in Laputa gained the flying death fortress after killing hundreds of soldiers and then just suddenly turned good! If you establish a villain as an evil warmonger and you don't want a violent resolution, have Howl encourage the people to stand up to her! Maybe the soldiers throw down their arms and refuse to shoot the civilians, which causes her to flee. Don't just have her turn good at random!\\n\\nArt: The ONLY reason I gave this a 6. The art is absolutely gorgeous.\\n\\nSound: Pretty good. Not great, but pretty good.\\n\\n\\nOverall:\\n\\nI haven't seen Ponyo yet, but I'm willing to bet this is going to be the worst Miyazaki movie for me by a country mile. The art and animation is beautiful and it clearly tried hard, but nothing in this film worked. The characters, the story, the themes, were all a mess. Yet somehow this piece of shit might be the highest rated Miyazaki film on MAL. HOW?! Did people just give it a 10 back in 2008 because Miyazaki made it and then everyone forgot about it? I guess people actually talk about how good Naussica, or Spirited Away or Porco Rosso is and this inspires backlash and rating bombing from random assholes. This manages to escape unscathed because nobody online goes on and on about how amazing this movie is. This is NOBODY's favorite Miyazaki film. It's a wonderful looking mistake.\",\n",
       "  '**SPOILER FREE REVIEW** Erased is a grippingly cinematic, but ultimately childish and half-baked attempt at an anime mystery drama that makes a mockery out of the serious themes it chooses to incorporate. However, that didn’t seem to stop it from taking the anime world by storm and soaring into the top FIVE on the all time MAL rankings while it was still airing. Yikes. This show is clumsy, saturated in over-convenience, and excruciatingly awkward at times, but it’s obvious that something about Erased really resonated with a lot of people. Let’s find exactly what makes this show popular and, more importantly, where it all went wrong. Synopsis:Satoru Fujinuma, our protagonist, is a detached 29 year old Manga artist who possesses a special ability that he refers to as “Revival”, which causes him to be sent back in time several minutes before tragic accidents that occur in his general vicinity, whether he wants to or not. He will continue to be sent back in time until he stops the event in question from occurring. One day, tragedy strikes, but this time, Satoru is sent 18 whole years in the past. Soon, he realizes that the event he has to prevent is the abduction and killing of one of his classmates, the solitary and mysterious Kayo Hinazuki, which took place when he was a child. \\n\\nIf you couldn’t tell right of the bat after reading the synopsis, Erased was playing with fire from the very beginning. The use of time resets as a plot device carries great power in the context of a story, and with great power comes great responsibility. The problem with time resets is that if you don’t establish strict and appropriate rules and restrictions from the very beginning, it becomes nothing more than a transparently lazy deus ex machina whose properties bend and shape to the convenience of the plot. Nothing breaks immersion like some mystical superpower with no established boundaries that seamlessly drifts in and out of the plot for no discernible reason, only reappearing to solve otherwise unsolvable problems. This is a problem that Erased has, and it’s one of the main things that make the story so impossible to take seriously. Satoru’s “Revival” ability has absolutely no rules. It shows up for no logical reason, doesn’t show up in situations where it did before, contradicts the very short and insufficient explanation we were given of it, and the story can’t seem to decide if he has the ability to consciously trigger it or if he does not. It’s madness. Utter chaos. The foundation of this anime’s premise was so badly botched that it causes the world of Erased to come off as one that doesn’t have any rules, and that is far and away its biggest failure as a mystery drama. I don’t mean to suggest that Revival is the only aspect of this show that is overly convenient and lazy though; the anime is riddled with poor planning and lack of explanation. For example, people show up for no reason and out of nowhere at the best/worst possible moment on a consistent basis, like this is some sort of battle shounen. Erased’s writing is a disaster, plain and simple.\\n\\nI could talk for a long time about the technical problems of Erased’s storyline, but it commits a sin that is perhaps even more egregious: The bastardization of a mature theme. Namely, child abuse. If you are going to incorporate such a serious and heart-wrenching topic into your story, fine; just make sure that you treat it with the respect that it deserves. Unfortunately, Erased utterly fails to do that. Instead, it merely shoehorns it in as a cheap, lowest-common-denominator way of tugging at our heartstrings. Erased chooses to make us feel bad for its characters not by fleshing them out with personality, but by having them be graphically beaten on camera for reasons that are completely unnecessary to the plot. This edgy, shock-factor bullshit is what cemented my dislike of this show. This is the kind of thing that doesn’t just impede my enjoyment of the anime, but makes me genuinely angry that the writers thought they could manipulate the emotions of the viewers so underhandedly. It’s completely shameless, and they should be embarrassed.\\n\\nThere’s one more aspect of this show’s plot that I can’t resist mentioning... *Sigh…  Hear me out on this one. Maybe this is just me, but the entire premise of this show is fucking CREEPY. Seriously. There are some shockingly blatant pedophilic undertones in Erased. There are multiple instances where the protagonist, WHO IS 29 YEARS OLD, gets obviously aroused by the thought of a relationship (or more…) with Hinazuki, who is a child. If you think I’m joking, there is scene in the latter half of the show where Hinazuki is taking a bath and Satoru overhears her from the other room. He then gets a flustered/uncomfortable, flushed look on his face and thinks to himself, and I quote, “Get a hold of yourself. You’re 29.” WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT SHIT MAN???  That’s not a one-time thing either! That is a reoccurring gag throughout the show! Who the HELL thought that would be a good idea?! Is this some sort of underground fetish show or something? Was it made for people who fantasize about fucking children while they are also in the body of a child? Nobody is ever going to convince me that Satoru’s reoccurring and vague attraction to Hinazuki is not disturbing as hell. It makes my skin crawl, and more importantly, it makes the show even more impossible to take seriously. This is incorporating humor into your show GONE WRONG.\\n\\nAs bad as Erased’s plot is, even shows with bad plots can often be redeemed if they have a strong cast of characters. Well, Erased doesn’t have that. Not even close, in fact. Our protagonist, Satoru, is your standard white-knight archetype. If you don’t know what that is, it’s when a character is defined entirely by his desire to be morally righteous and help others. There is literally no other defining trait to this character whatsoever! The first episode makes it seem like they would make him deadpan or detached or, hell, SOMETHING in order to differentiate him, but no. Any individuality Satoru may have possessed in the first episode completely evaporates and is nowhere to be found from episode 2 and onwards. He’s just a walking, talking robot who spurns the plot forward with his soulless, mechanically predictable actions. At no point, except maybe in the first episode, did I care about this character, and that is a certain way for a show to fail.\\n\\nNow let’s talk about Satoru’s love interest (Yes, I’m calling her that. This show knows what it did), Kayo Hinazuki. Kayo is a character that is able to single-handedly exemplify so much of what is wrong with this show, in the sense that she is not a real character at all; she is a plot device, just like the rest of the cast. Her sole purpose is to be used as a literal whipping post just so that justice-kun can swoop in to be her knight in shining armor and pretend he doesn’t want to get into those prepubescent pants. She is nothing more than an object the show utilizes to manipulate the emotions of the viewers; an artificially created victim who exists only to suffer some one-dimensional, interchangeable hardship rather than an actual character with a personality and interesting outlooks, dreams, or crises.  Erased is lazy, deceiving character writing at its finest.\\n\\nSo at this point, if you haven’t watched Erased, you may be wondering that if everything I wrote in the above paragraphs is true, what is the appeal of this show? The answer, quite simply, is that the cinematography is very well executed and the directing is very engaging. The environments are always crisp and detailed, plus the shot composition is absolutely spot-on in most instances. There are notable exceptions, but I won’t get into that. As for the directing, Erased presents information to the viewer in a very streamlined, matter of fact manner. Scenes intended to be connected are always spelled out to the viewer through the use of flashbacks, and lots of creative transition sequences are used with narrative accompaniment between scenes. I prefer when shows leave it up to the viewer to deduce certain things rather than being spoon-fed, but for what they were going for, they did a good job. Erased looks good, is animated dramatically, and is easy to digest. Those are the factors that lead to its massive popularity, and frankly, those are the only aspects of the show that can’t be harshly criticized justifiably. \\n\\nAt the end of the day, Erased is just another overhyped anime written for edgy teens that uses cheap, manipulative tactics to emotionally affect the audience, fooling them into thinking it’s a well-written show when it obviously isn’t. It’s immature, terribly inconsistent, the characters are soulless plot devices, and its laughable use of the ultimate anime cliché “time resets” is just the icing on the cake. Erased is a bad show with good animation, and sometimes, that’s all a show needs to get popular.',\n",
       "  'A quick review on why I highly disliked this show, albeit obviously being one of the best/most popular this season. Building up a mystery/thriller is hard. Establishing a unique utopia, as in one we know nothing about, is even harder. Setting them both up simultaneously is incredibly ambitious. And considering this show is a mere 12 episodes, I reckon near impossible. The Promised Neverland deftly managed to reasonably accomplish both tasks, but by forcing such ambition into so little time, I couldn\\'t help but feel it couldn\\'t possibly fill it\\'s promise, and imo, I was right. For a show so heavily reliant on its characters (which forthe record were very well done in the time available), I consistently felt like I didn\\'t know enough about them, I was never invested. You could argue that\\'s just how these type of plots are, but I disagree. Monster, angel beats, eden of the east, and many isekai manage to either suffice or fill that craving with some distraction. Besides Neverland\\'s promising storytelling, nothing else was offered. The story simply felt lackluster due to lack of meaningfulness, liking the characters just isn\\'t enough.\\n\\nWhile this show didn\\'t fall terribly into the trap of introducing too many ideas and developments too late, there was too much off the get go to keep up. If there is one thing I truly hate in any media I consume, it is wasted potential. This whole season was equivalent to an arc, and that arc was a rushed introduction. The \"mystery\" was too involved to allow characters to develop, important moments I\\'d argue were crucial for the story were often skipped, likable characters without depth are merely cliches. Again, for a show heavily reliant on it\\'s characters, they weren\\'t substantial enough.\\n\\nThe story barely progressed, the characters were barely developed beyond an introduction to their personality, the mystery was showcased just enough to make sense, but not enough to add any sort of \\'mysterious feel\\'. Despite being genuinely a good show, it felt empty. An empty show doesn\\'t deserve a good rating.\\n\\nIf by some magic you haven\\'t watch this show yet, sentimental to my grievances of it, and somewhat align with my way of thinking, here is my advice. Do NOT watch this show. Until either season 2 is midway through and seems promising, or better, until the whole series ends. There is a TON of promise, but it simply didn\\'t occur here; nor enough to guarantee it next season. \\n\\nI rate this season 4/10, but considering the hype for this show it\\'s safe to assume another season will happen, and the premise can still reach its full potential. The show isn\\'t bad nor ruined, I just wish this season was either 24+ episodes or simplified down to 2-4 to allow some seriously needed investment.',\n",
       "  'So... what is the point of this series again...? While it is cute, the entire gimmick feels off. The quintuplets don\\'t feel like real characters, they turn very quickly from hating the main character to falling in love with him, over literally basic interaction. Are their standards that low? Or did they never have any basic interaction with the opposite sex? How come they all fall in love with the same person in the exact same time? Nothing here makes sense and makes the characters feel like writing tools to make the fantasy of the writer come to fruition as that fantasy would never work in reallife due to how stupid and badly written it is. Why the hell was it needed to create a harem with identical sisters, or family members to begin with? What would the 4 do once there\\'s a winner? Try to kill her? Or just accept that they lost their \"love of their life\"? Its extremely stupid, written bad and unbelievable.\\n\\nThere is so many unneeded drama because they can\\'t literally talk over the situation and their feelings. They would rather have awkward situations, run away one from another or fight and argue over the silliest stuff instead of taking a deep breath and thinking before throwing stuff out of their mouths. \\n\\nIt has too many cliches - the childhood friend part, the girls are pretty much perfect in terms of looks, from their face to their body to everything they represent outside. Don\\'t forget that they come from a rich home, and obviously the father that hired their teacher is never in it so they can have some accidents and dumb stuff happening to support the typical harem cliches.\\n\\nWhat father in their right mind would hire a high school student at the age of his daughters to tutor them as a private teacher? The fact he knew his daughters are problematic and refuse to study should make things obvious for him about how strict he was supposed to be, but no, let a kid take over everything and don\\'t get involved even in the slightest and expect for some results. HE NEVER EVEN PHYSICALLY CHECKED TO SEE WHAT IS GOING ON OR NEVER EVEN MET THE TEACHER IN PERSON.\\n\\nIgnoring the dumb story - the art is sometimes pretty good and sometimes feels really off. The animation for most of the adaptation is really bad, to the point where fluid movement barely exists in the adaptation other than the last few episodes. The running animation felt really choppy and badly drawn most of the time, except for the anime openings where they wasted several frames on boobs bouncing because that\\'s apparently the most important part... Either way, the sound design is fine, nothing special but never felt bad. The characters are non-existent. Futaro is fine~ish, while some of his reactions are dumb and are only written in a certain way to lead to awkwardly bad situations, he is the typical main character that people like to shove to harem animes, so its fine. The quintuplets aren\\'t real characters, their dad isn\\'t a real character, Futaro\\'s dad looks like a slightly older brother and doesn\\'t really feel like an actual dad, and his sister is somewhat alright considering she is supposed to be a little girl.\\n\\nIf you like to watch 5 identical beautiful girls throw themselves over some random boy for the fact he is a little \"nice\" to them I guess this show is for you. Otherwise, do yourself a favor and run away from this piece of garbage.',\n",
       "  'My So-Far review of Kuroshitsuji.... Sorry, guys. I wanted to like it- I REALLY WANTED TO LIKE IT. I am a teenage otaku girl. I watch Hetalia (hence the username) , I watch Shounen such as Hunter x Hunter (a masterpiece... highly recommended) , One Piece, Fullmetal Alchemist. I have seen Shoujo such as Clannad, Kanon, and Anohana. I have seen horror, such as Elfen Lied and Another. I have seen it all- covered every base, from Yaoi to violent fighting scenes. But this... this was not enjoyable for me. I watched 18 episodes- I couldn\\'t suffer through any more of Ciel\\'s irritating whining, Sebastian\\'s gary-stu perfection, the workers\\'over-the-top fails (being done over. And over. And over again) . \\nI am going to be more specific in why I hated this.\\n\\n~~The Good \\nThe animation was breathtaking. It was some of the best I have ever seen. The detailed ruffles, the designs for the time period\\'s clothing- it was a treat, honestly. \\nThe hairstyles- amazing. The faces- amazing (although certain characters tended to look a bit alike). The proportions, the movement, the soft feel that it had while still being insanely intense- it was quite an experience. I absolutely adored it.

Just please, make it more rare and change it up from time to time. PLEASE.\\n\\nAnd, the story. \\nThe story was all-right. I watched 18 episodes, but nothing really happened with the plot. All I saw was cross dressing 12 year olds, a perfect looking butler guy throwing forks, lots of whining from everyone (except Sebastian because he\\'s just THAT perfect) , short shorts, more cross dressing, and lots of cats.\\nThe story of Kuroshitsuji season 1 in a nutshell, everyone. Have fun.',\n",
       "  \"Sophie is your average teen girl living a mediocre life with no purpose - Unlike her beautiful sister, whom she envies within her soul, she is rather plain and her measure of self-worth suffers for it. One day, she encounters a dashingly handsome man. He saves her from the leering of soldiers. He steals her heart with a graceful display of his abilities. Almost suddenly, her life has taken a magical turn!First off, let it be said that this is an INCREDIBLY SUBTLE film. \\nIt is highly unlikely that you will understand it in one sitting - I had the film fly right over my head and was left in disappointment by what I had then perceived to be weak writing on Miyazaki's rendition of the classic YA novel by Diana Wynne Jones.\\n\\nThink Chekhov's Gun when it comes to (almost) everything here - why a character makes an otherwise confusing or obvious remark; why were you shown a shot of someone doing something otherwise ordinary. The trick here is to notice these key moments of foreshadowing or revelation in all the deepest throes of gorgeous eye-gasm. \\n\\nThen think outside the box. With enough contemplation you will be able to see beyond the surface themes of this work of art.\\n\\nStory: 8/10 \\n\\nThis is a story about revelation, perspective and acceptance. Its subtleties are truly subtleties - Miyazaki seems rather unafraid of having his audiences miss something utterly crucial to the interpretation of the plot.\\nThemes dance across the surface of the water but never really submerge the viewer into its depths unless the viewer has had time for contemplation.\\nThe pacing is good but not stellar - there are minor hiccups here and there which are inevitable given the source material. My biggest gripe is the abrupt closure of some issues at the end.\\n\\n\\nArt: 9/10 \\n\\nFrom the hand-painted landscapes to the marvel of the Moving Castle, from the expressions of characters to the non-expression of things, Howl's Moving Castle is a technical masterpiece of 2D animation.\\n\\n\\nSound: 6/10\\n\\nWhile the sound and music are decent they do not add something to the show nor necessarily express a part of the show well.\\n\\n\\nCharacter: 7/10\\nCharacter designs are strong in the leads, however some individuals never really achieve any level of depth.\\n\\n\\nEnjoyment: 7/10 \\nWatch and you will no doubt be enthralled by the magic of Miyazaki's craft and his ability to tell stories about the human condition - Howl's is a departure from his usual flavouring of film and has elements of its source work permeate its atmosphere in quiescence.\\n\\n\\nOverall: 7/10\\nHowl's Moving Castle is a nuanced film with amazing animation that is not afraid to be sophisticated. It has strong rewatch value (even more so than his other films) and tackles some psychological aspects inherent in all fictional works with mercy and finesse.\"],\n",

Sadly I\\'ve come to find that PC players are just as ignored as console when it comes to BHVR. Dead by Daylight is an incredible product that is trapped underneath the thumb of idiots who don\\'t know what to do with it. Every update just adds more bugs than features.At one point, years ago, Cote had described the game as \"no longer theirs, it now belonged to the community\" which at the time I thought was beautiful. Years later, however, after new hires like Ethan, the game has belittled, ignored, and straight up asked veterans to leave.DBD releases ptb\\'s to put up a front that they listen to the community while then releasing multiple patches like The Twins, and Mid Chapter 4.5 that completely ignore the complaints of the community. After how many new things broke today, I finally had enough that I was going to submit individual bug tickets to them for every bug they\\'ve been neglecting, only to find out they\\'ve updated their website to hide bug tickets at the very bottom and shrunk the box to a 5th of the previous size, while having added tons of pictures and ads for the game, and top centering a small FAQ style technical support for things already fixed. BHVR is a company that actively disrespects their community, herds morons like sheep into defending their actively bad decisions by posting occasional memes, and milks the game and its players by working minimally and at their own whim while we beg and plead for them to just acknowledge they heard what we have to say.

       "  \"Decent Waifu looter-shooter game that is kinda fun to play with friends or other people. The game has certain charms but  some areas needs immediate improvement. Anyway after completing the campaign, leveling characters & weapons & build-crafting for endgame content, below are some Pros & Cons from my perspective. The game uses Unreal Engine 5 so the graphics are visually stunning. The various locations in the game looks really amazing! The character designs are great in my opinion with interesting background stories for each of the Descendants.  Really liked the sound design of the game & understood that a lot of effort has been put in it. I was really surprised by the fact each Descendant has their own music theme (both Combat & Ambient) that fits their profile nicely. Really makes you feel like a Hero while playing. The combat style is third-person & it takes a bit to get used to if you play a lot of FPS but after a short while it becomes kinda fun. Build-crafting in general is decent but a lot of aspects can be improved which I will highlight in the Cons. The campaign missions are really fun if you are playing with friends. The endgame content starts once you have fully completed the campaign & the endgame content is really great in terms of difficulty & rewards. I had played this game since the 1st Beta & since that a lot of improvements & optimization has been made to the game. The game support both Nvidia DLSS, AMD FSR, Intel XESS & EPIC TSR. Most importantly this supports AMD FSR Frame-Gen which works on all Graphics Cards. However, I have heard some folks having issues while running the game, so I guess more optimization is needed.  Nexon Games (publisher) regularly runs events where you can claim free stuff which helps a lot with the grind & progression. The Publisher actually looks into the reported players report & actively checks for folks who are cheating or getting unfair advantages & actually ban these accounts regularly. The story campaign is kinda short & for most of the missions you need to rerun the same kind of activities over & over again. The Void Intercept missions however are on a different realm. The campaign difficulty is not at all balanced if you are playing solo. There are a couple of unavoidable missions where  the completion is almost impossible if you are playing solo. You will get overwhelmed with enemies. But if you are playing the main campaign with a friend the difficulty becomes an absolute joke. The RNG...the freaking RNG. This game's RNG is an absolute ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ joke. I though the RNG of Destiny 2 was bad but this game's RNG is like 10 times worse. The drop rates do not follow the percentages shown in game at all. If you are farming for Ultimate Descendants then good luck, the components for these have very low chance to drop (like <10%) there is no guarantee that it is gonna drop for you even after hours of grind.....you might have to grind for days or even weeks before a rare component drops (unless you are a person who can play 15+ hrs every single day). These kind of looter-shooter games are kind grindy (you need to farm to get the good stuff) but boy oh boy The First Descendant takes the grind to a whole new level. This character buildup is mostly copied from Warframe but is a worse version. There are tons of different components which are needed for different items which becomes a nightmare to track. In order to create a weapon you need the weapon parts > then you need to get the various sub-components to create it > create the weapon parts > then at last create the weapon. But Noooo, you are not done yet...If you want your ultimate weapons to be at their max potential, you need to craft the weapon 4 more time to enhance it to the max which adds for an absolutely painful grind.  The socket catalyzation mechanics (copied from Warframe) absolutely needs to change to a Universal socket type that slots all instead of having 7 different socket types, like Warframe already has. This is Free to Play game so that means there will be monetization. But the prices for the various components & Descendants are absolutely ridiculous & are not at all worth spending unless you have a ton of money to burn. The Ultimate Descendants cost ~100$ if you don't wanna a grind for it. So yea, absolutely ridiculous. But if the publishers decide to reduce these prices to make them affordable to average gamers, then a lot of folks will start buying these & will also increase playerbase. If you are playing cross-region, you are gonna definitely experience minor lags during dungeons/ invasions.  Well, since this a Korean game, there will be skimpy outfits available in the store for the female characters. I am not complaining about it to be removed or anything but a simple censor option in-game to hide the overtly skimpy outfits in the social space at-least will be great addition. As every-time you load into Albion (the main city & social space), you will be greeted by a sea of half-naked butts in very skimpy outfits which a lot of folks don't want to see every single time! From what I see is that the publishers are also actively taking feedback from the community to improve various aspects of the game. Overall, if the RNG problems & other problems plaguing this game is fixed then it has the potential to become a great game & maybe get into top 10 titles!\",\n",

Do not buy the game if you were looking for thrilling moments or jumpscares.\\n\\n\\n2- All the upgradable equipment is made to make navigation and fishing much easier and faster, however I haven't personally seen anything original about it\\n\\n\\n3- Side characters aren't bad, but also aren't that compelling or engaging, even though there was lots of room to expand on their personal stories and struggles throughout the main story and some side quests4- Why so many positive reviews then?  Dredge is a nice indie, navigating and upgrading your boat and fishing tools feels rewarding, as each species has its own minigame that you'll need to overcome in order to be able to get your nets out and the fishes in, besides there aren't at the moment games such like these on Steam as Dredge is a nice mixture of navigation , open world and (simplified) commerce mechanicsVerdict: 7Time required to finish the main game (without the DLC, which lasts 2 hours) : 9/10 hrs Time required to complete it at 100% with the DLCs: 25-30 hours (depending on luck)IRON RIG DLC review: https://steamcommunity.com/id/delfinofurioso/recommended/2561450/Thanks for reading, leave a comment below if you have any questions or observations, feel free to follow my other reviews at: https://store.steampowered.com/curator/32344423/\",\n",

While the idea behind Marvel Rivals isn't particularly original, the game offers many cool gameplay mechanics, a strong art style, and an old-school monetization system where simply playing the game actually earns you in-game currency.The game doesn't necessarily force you to focus on a single meta or play style. Even at launch, there are 33 playable heroes, each bringing something special to the table. This aspect truly makes the game shine.So far, I am extremely happy with Marvel Rivals. I remember making fun of this game with my friends just a couple of weeks ago, only to be absolutely dumbstruck by this phenomenal modern hero shooter. I don't know how long I’ll keep playing Marvel Rivals, but I guess the multiplayer PvP side of gaming isn't dead—at least, not just yet.\",\n",
       "  \"Let me start off by saying Assassins Creed is my favorite game series. I have played every game multiple times over. What made me fall in love with Assassins Creed was not necessarily just the game play it was the awesome stories that unfolded in each game and through consecutive games. Now that we have set the stage lets talk about Shadows:Pros: Best game mechanics since the introduction of the RPG elements in Origins. I wasn't a huge fan of the change and combat but in this game it felt like I had more freedom in fights and more options and approaches to take on equipment. The stealth mechanics is the best out of all Assassins Creed if you play on highest difficulty (I recommend you do this or this game is a walk in the park).The game is stunning. Exploring different parts of the map didn't seem as much as a chore since you got to look at this world from different views.Playing as Noae was really fun. Exactly how I want my assassins creed play through to go. Excellent stealth and not way to powerful in fights but good based on build and skill. Everything in the skill tree is viable for different builds.Love the main base. ALL upgrades are meaningful and its not a ridiculous amount of buildings. I upgraded and built them all by the end of the game by just clearing forts during main or side quests. Truthfully if we get more Assassins Creed games (which I really hope so, I dont want it to end like this) I hope they keep the main base mechanics just like this.Cons: The story for this game is the absolute worst in all the assassins creed games. This game wanted to do some many things and half assed all of them. The game is so long but even when you get to the ending it is so anti climatic that you feel as though there is going to be a Shadows 2. They could of done so much with this game and it really fell flat in all aspects story wise.Playing as Yaske is playing the game on easy mode. Yaske takes 0 skill, just mash attack with the occasional skill/parry. Don't even get me started on how he cant parcore or stealth. Like what is the point of this type of character in an assassins game. If this was a different game without the assassins creed title whatever but come on. Yaske feels forced into this story and honestly should of been a naoe only game. Putting the whole political issue aside, if they made Yaske make sense, I wouldn't have cared but man is he forced. If you play this game play with noae as much as possible.Equipment is not balanced. I am not one to go for over powered builds or search for them but man, its hard not to find them. I found a build where it was literally impossible for an enemy to attack me with noae. Easiest boss fights of my life.WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY to many targets. I got so bored of going after the side targets half way through the game. Way to many of them.Don't play in English. The Japanese accents are really bad to the point its like racism LOL.Overall Thoughts:I am going to not recommend this game purely based on price. This game is not the best but also not the worst. If you can get this game half off and as long as you dont care about the story this game is alright. If you got free time to kill and its cheap, sure go for it. If your looking for the next big hit, keep it moving.\",\n",

       "  \"773 hours on steam1260 hours on originS1 playerThis is the worst state the game has been in. Corporate greed has destroyed the game. There have been more updates in the shop rather than the actual content. Respawn and EA are milking the player base for half-baked skins. Most recently, they have repackaged a collector’s event into a “milestone event.” The skins themselves are mediocre, and you are forced to gamble if there are any skins you desire.  Above all, EA and Respawn are down bad for money. Their tactics for monetization are downright disgusting. The entire business model is milking the loyal player base for as much money as they can get. They have not been doing anything to increase the player count or to get new people to play. They are most likely using the “walk back” method. It is where they will roll out a massive change, and proceed to revert it halfway after negative feedback so people are accepting of a new worse standard. They are only updating their live service ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.  I understand that the battle pass does not bring in players – it is the game and the quality of the gameplay. The real issue is Respawn and EA having predatory monetary practices instead of fixing the bugs and vast cheater problem. It is evident that several issues and bugs are here to stay, given how long they have been in the game. A five-year-old, multi-billion-dollar AAA game consistently has failures and game-breaking issues. Respawn is doing the bare minimum in communication (Responding to the situation and fixing it quickly.) The only time they have communicated with the player base is after the negative decline of the game. Respawn has released a statement saying that they need to be better. However, this is a response to the negative feedback, not to the community. The community they got the feedback from was likely their shareholders!  This is a statement and not a genuine action! Most of their social media posts are about cosmetics! This downward spiral will only worsen until Respawn recognizes and understands the importance of improving the player's experience. These are some of the common issues the game has faced: - Rampant cheating issue - Pro players are given aimbot mid-ALGS game - No audio:The game does not need to prioritize these things    • My teammate's footsteps     • My teammate's healing audio     • Any voice line that isn't telling me there's another team     • Annoying SFX for killing the kill leader/champion - Evo level up - Input latency - MnK noreg hit registration (feels so muddy) - Inability to patch glitches - Harsh SBMM matchmaking - Rough solo queue experience - Visual clutter (issue has been in the game since release)- Bullet flinch/Aim Punch - Stale meta - Server lag:   • Ping jittering (up and down in steps of 1ms in a 10-20ms range, as well as climbing up and down between 20ms and 100ms throughout the game)    • Packet loss    • Servers are extremely unstable at times.    • Servers are still 20 ticks    • Rubberbanding\",\n",

The actual game loop, the gamePLAY - wonderful stuff. Would literally never get old IF the matchmaking were...different(?) Stop me if you\\'ve heard this one before... To preface this, I want to address the point delusional EA worshipers constantly throw back at my particular critique, before anyone even says it this time: Not everyone has the will, let alone desire, to browse Reddit forums in an effort to find similarly skilled randoms to play with in order to simulate a balanced matchmaking system. People on the internet are weird + I\\'m not a social butterfly. Sifting through all that ♥♥♥♥ is not for me and I don\\'t think that\\'s a reasonable expectation to have of your playerbase. What I WANT to do is play with my actual friends, who have historically been willing, to their credit, to endure many sessions with me. Those sessions typically involve(d) them being instantly one-clipped to start an engagement by players they NEVER should\\'ve been facing in pubs, let alone ranked, and leaving me to attempt to 1v2/3, again, MOST of the time. I\\'m historically a 2-ish KD player at my best; I\\'m solid at the game, but I\\'m simply not capable of consistently beating Master and Predator-tier 3-stacks who populate our lobbies, especially not in a numbers disadvantage. But that\\'s how it goes. Matchmaking sees my relatively functional skill level, ignores my friends\\' substantially lower skill potential, and away we go for 12 straight crushing defeats before someone decides this is a waste of time. And I can\\'t fault them! It is absolutely a waste of time to just get steamrolled over and over and over because the game used your twitching corpse to fill ultra-high MMR lobbies instead of offering any kind of balanced experience. And imagine how much worse it is for my friends who are already weak players, trying to come back after extended breaks from the game. Forget about it. I\\'ve been on hiatus from Apex for the better part of a calendar year now, but every once in a while I get the urge to jump back in, thinking SURELY this time it\\'ll be different. I read the other day a post from EA/Respawn (whatever) from the beginning of 2022 describing the \"previous\" matchmaking system in detail (which I never expected them to ever do) and going pretty vaguely through their alleged plans to rework and revamp said system. They even admitted that the longstanding format, as everyone suspected, was simply matching the entire party to the best player\\'s skill level for the purpose of finding an \"appropriate\" lobby. But supposedly their preliminary testing data for this new approach supported a more *gasp* balanced matchmaking experience for the majority of skill levels, and they intended to phase out the \"highest skill\" matchmaking that had made the game so cancerous for so long. I figured, ♥♥♥♥, this was almost a year ago! Surely by NOW it\\'s fully implemented and I can actually rally the lads once more for the ultimate revenge round! Finally I can quench my thirst for this awesome but unplayable game! Then I browse the Steam discussions and some Reddit threads. By all accounts the matchmaking is worse than ever before, with all evidence pointing to some unannounced matchmaking change taking place over the summer. This is the overwhelming consensus online, even factoring out the people who are obviously just irrationally mad or calling everyone a cheater. I firmly believe based on my thousand hours in this game that the cheaters, while they totally do exist, are almost all hanging out in high-level ranked games. It\\'s not common to find cheaters in pubs. However, I can totally understand how newer/less competent players would automatically assume they\\'re facing cheaters when they\\'re getting insta-beamed by players who should NEVER HAVE BEEN IN THEIR LOBBIES. It\\'s really, really sad to waste a game like this because of something so seemingly fixable. At least from a layman\\'s perspective, why not just matchmake based on the AVERAGE skill level of your team? In our case, that would, in theory, largely squeeze out the top-1% players while also allowing in some people closer to my friends\\' level. They\\'d still have a challenge, but it\\'d be so much fairer for them. I would have a mixed experience, but much better chance of carrying a fight against a slightly stronger team if necessary. Let me be clear in that I do not by any means expect to be able to like, pub-stomp the way Preds do for views or some ♥♥♥♥. I want a challenge that my friends can REASONABLY hold up against, at least SOME of the time. And don\\'t give me that goofy BS about the playerbase being too small to support the kind of solution I\\'m describing. There\\'s over 120,000 people playing on Steam as I write this on a random Tuesday. It just sucks. This is far and away my favorite PvP game of all time. I would play it daily if I could, even working full time. I would find time for this game. I would even spend money on skins and ♥♥♥♥, knowing full well that EA is evil and doesn\\'t deserve a penny from me. The game is that freakin\\' good. In theory. But I gotta stop lying to myself every few months just to be immediately disappointed each time I try to go back. When I mention Apex at this point my friends just laugh and then we return to reality. This game is unplayable. Each season has brought with it some kinda new bugs to exploit or server instability or poor map rotation, etc. But the unfair matchmaking has been the one glaring constant for seemingly the entirety of Apex\\'s existence outside of maybe the beta run, during which I was too bad at the game to notice any critical nuances. But yeah, the community feedback loudly confirms this. Glancing up, I see the recent reviews on Steam have been crap. Shocking. Yet here we are, again, as always. Perhaps EA\\'s market research suggests that they shouldn\\'t fix this problem for some disgusting micro-transaction-related reason. Honestly, at this point, I HOPE the reason is something outwardly malicious like that, if only to confirm that they have a vested interest in NOT fixing anything. Because otherwise there\\'s just truly no excuse. RIP this game.Update 11.25.23It\\'s somehow worse than ever. Placed in Silver 2, I\\'m being put exclusively in Diamond+ lobbies despite my ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ stats this season and no ranked history in the last few seasons.

As someone who enjoyed the original series, this reboot feels like a love letter to fans while also being accessible to new players.The large-scale battles are truly impressive, combining wide-open maps with a variety of objectives that demand both strategy and skill. Whether you’re sneaking through enemy lines or engaging in all-out firefights, the gameplay keeps you on your toes. The freedom to approach missions in your own way is a standout feature, making every operation feel fresh and personal.Visually, the game looks great. The updated graphics capture the intensity of combat while maintaining the spirit of the original series. The sound design also deserves praise, with immersive effects that pull you into the battlefield.One of the highlights for me is the multiplayer mode. It’s chaotic, intense, and incredibly fun, especially with friends. Teamwork is key, and the variety of roles and equipment ensures every player can contribute meaningfully to the mission.While there’s room for improvement in some areas, like AI behavior and mission variety, Delta Force successfully revives a classic franchise with modern enhancements.

Unfortunately, mentally challenged individuals in the video game industry have decided to copy-paste this deeply flawed system everywhere instead of creating something new and intelligent specifically for online gaming which can take actual player skill levels into consideration using as little as a handful of matches to determine your abilities.The end result is that we currently have a brain damaged robot trying to artificially enforce a 50% win rate, primarily by filling your team with the most incompetent players it can find and/or making you face them and it will keep doing this for THOUSANDS of matches because it needs MOUNTAINS of win/loss data in order to even begin to start being remotely accurate with constructing fair games. It is the absolute worst dumpsterfire system that exists and it needs to be violently removed from all video games (including this one) ASAP.There\\'s also no Role Queue so you\\'re frequently going to be in situations where there\\'s 4-5 duelists, etc, basically guaranteeing you lose due to not having 2-3 healers on your team and/or don\\'t get to play what you actually wanted to play (god forbid).

It gives random champions HUGE bonuses and broken combos with other heroes. This is stuff you put into PvE games to mix things up and it has absolutely no place in a PVP hero shooter. Everyone wants it gone but the devs refuse to axe it:https://gamerant.com/marvel-rivals-seasonal-bonuses-bad/People also screamed at the developers to tone down the healing in season 0 and they completely ignored this feedback as well. As a result, we\\'re now going through a \"2-3 healer meta\" due to healing being completely broken. If you\\'re being healed, you\\'re basically immortal. Trying to kill a healer being healed by another healer? You may as well go AFK unless you have 3 other teammates focusing them down with you simultaneously AND they\\'re standing still. Yes, they are really that broken.There\\'s tons more specific issues like Hela still being broken after a \"nerf\" but overall, the devs are completely tone-deaf and clueless in terms of listening to feedback and balancing respectively.The game runs like utter garbage thanks to it being made on UE5, the worst performing game engine of all time. Instead of optimizing the game, the lazy &/ incompetent developers completely rely on people having DLSS/Frame Generation on in order to achieve an acceptable framerate while also forcing you to compile shaders every single time you start the game.\"Not a big deal\" some might say but most unfortunately, the game logic is currently tied to your framerate:https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/game-breaking-marvel-rivals-bug-puts-players-with-bad-pcs-at-a-huge-disadvantage-3017245/Yes that\\'s right.

And after that, they thought it\\'d be even funnier to start mass-banning people trying to fix their game for them by editing option .ini files to remove things such as mouse acceleration and trying to fix their terrible framerate by turning the horrible AA off (more on that below).Going an extra step beyond, they\\'ve also censorshipped the game to high heaven. You can\\'t say \"Tank and healer\", mention Winnie the Pooh or Taiwan in the game and a billion other things:https://thedirect.com/article/marvel-rivals-winnie-the-pooh-bannedAn extremely ironic thing considering the theme of the game is fighting for freedomThe game is offensively colorful and uses obnoxious flashy effects whenever possible. While it only made my eyes slightly tired after 90 minutes of playing, i truly pity \"professionals\" that have to play this several hours every day and i don\\'t even want to know how many seizures this game has caused so far.It also has destructive terrain but instead of creating a game with coherent visual design that can let you easily visually identify what can and cannot be broken, the incompetent developers instead decided to give everyone Batman \"Chrono\" vision that you turn on by pressing B to see what can be destroyed.It\\'s clear to me they utterly struggle to create anything resembling their own identity when it comes to map design as a lot of the maps are pretty blatantly OW copy-pasta (not to speak of all characters being canon). The worst however, is that the game currently forces you to have Anti-Aliasing on, including TAA. It is HORRIBLE and adds crazy ghosting like this to game visuals:https://i.imgur.com/wOXXRRZ.gifYou can watch this video to learn what it is in detail with more examples:Marvel Rivals has some serious issues when it comes to it\\'s roster. Tanks can dish out WAAAAY too much damage for being tanks whereas they can basically win 1v3\\'s without being healed. Healers have the same issue, being able to win pretty much every single 1v1 in the game (except maybe tanks) due to having substantial damage + self healing + shields + tiny hitboxes + abilities like \"go invisible\".The game is filled to the brink with them.[www.dexerto.com]The company behind this game is unfortunately located in China. This means that any and all of your user data & personal information they get their grubby little hands on is beamed straight back to the Chinese government\\'s servers. More details  here.The amount of licensed characters in this game gives it an incredibly fragile future. NetEase has not been transparent with any of their deals with MARVEL (and others) so as far as we know, it will shut down the moment their agreements run out and/or have entire characters unceremoniously removed from the game without notice. Could be a year from now on, or even months. We don\\'t know, so be very careful spending any actual money in this game.',\n",

       "  'And unlike many people, I don\\'t use that word often, if at all. Only a few games truly deserve such praise in my opinion. So when I say KCD2 is one of them, then you can be sure I was truly impressed by what I saw. KCD2 is basically KCD1, but 5 times better. That\\'s why you can refer to my KCD1 review and multiply every positive I pointed out by at least two. Everything is bigger, better and more entertaining than before. Steam forces me to cut every review in half every time I want to praise or criticize a game, so I\\'ll try to be as brief as possible, although this games deserves at least an essay on how great it is.One of the greatest improvements I\\'ve seen. KCD1\\'s story was decent, but it was mostly just... there. It did what was necessary, provided what was needed and wasn\\'t filled with logical errors and stupid discrepancies. It wasn\\'t something to write home about though. But now? Now we have a proper great story to rival and surpass many other of my beloved games. Absolutely no spoilers here though. You have to experience it for yourself. You\\'ll love these characters, dialogues and overall storytelling.Another greatly improved aspect. There are so many ways to finish  most  quests that even giving one as an example would eat all the space I have here. You can talk your way out of things, you can sneak, you can fight, yada yada yada, all that other RPG stuff (true RPG, not starfield, veilguard or elden ring). But there are also soooo many details and non-obvious ways to finish most of the quests, it honestly stunned me, and it still does. It looks as if the developers thought of almost everything, so if you use your imagination and deviate from the given objective while using logic, more often than not you will find that Warhorse have thought of that, and such things can even influence dialogues during this and further quests. NPCs remember what you did, they comment on it, they comment on what you do, how you act, how you\\'re dressed, are you smelly or drunk, etc. TES games had things like that, but they pale in comparison honestly.Another great improvement. KCD1\\'s was decent. KCD2\\'s is great.You guessed it, another big upgrade. It\\'s smooth, it\\'s not frustrating, it\\'s easy. Honestly, too easy for my taste. Master Strike once again solves everything. Maybe Hardcore will fix it, but I didn\\'t like KCD1\\'s Hardcore, so I\\'m not holding my breath. But even like that it\\'s still highly enjoyable, and you  can  lose if you\\'re too cocky. Also, only swords have Master Strike now, so that\\'s something. Turning off indicators is a fun way to make things more spicy, but I had to use a mod for that.Yep. Again. Another big step-up. Just riding through the forest is interesting in this game, and this is the greatest praise I can think of. Games like Witcher or Bethesda games rely heavily on POIs such as caves, castles, monster lairs, etc. Almost none of that here. Does this make exploration boring? It doesn\\'t. Because so many space that would be empty in any other game is filled with random encounters (the best I\\'ve seen in games so far too) and neat little discoveries that are also sometimes referenced by NPCs, but play no real role in quests.One example here: there was this wine merchant\\'s wagon I found that crashed near a small river. I took some wine for myself and left. 10-15 hours later I was tasked with tracking down some bandits, and one NPC said that I can find them near said wagon. Since I already knew where it was, it was easier for me to navigate and find those bandits. This will be even cooler when Hardcore is released, because such landmarks will help you find things when you can\\'t see your position on the map. This was neat in KCD1 as well, but here it\\'s much more detailed, and almost every NPC during most quests will give you clear enough instructions to find things you\\'re looking for without relying on a map or even compass.Didn\\'t think I\\'d praise something so trivial, but here we are. The only other game I can think of that impressed me with it\\'s unique interface was Persona 5. Here, it\\'s also uniquely stylish and authentic. It was also improved from a practical point of view, you can access your horse\\'s inventory from the same place as you own, for example. Also not something I praise often, but holy moly, this game is absolutely beautiful (and well-optimized!). I fully expected it to be just like KCD1, maybe slightly better. But it surpassed every expectation I had. It\\'s at least as beautiful as RDR2 (kinda sad that a 2018 game is the one I\\'m comparing this one to, as most new games are far laggier, and at the same time far-far uglier and technically inferior to RDR2).Surprisingly, almost none. I had a few bugs, but 95% of them were visual. No broken quests. The only big issue was when I needed to chase an NPC, but didn\\'t have the best horse, so I had to try ~20-30 times before I actually caught up with him. If my horse was at least a little bit slower, I\\'d have to reload an earlier save and find a faster horse to be sure. This was a story quest too, so bummer. Still, I caught the guy, so that\\'s something. I just wish it wasn\\'t a flat out \"You lost\" screen when I failed, but rather an alternative development for the quest, as is the case in many other quests, but oh well, can\\'t have everything.Other than that, the game has some minor issues, but that\\'s all they are. Minor and negligible.I\\'d also like to point out that realism in this game is not that tedious. Many people criticized RDR2 for such things, but I honestly think that RDR2 is more tedious than KCD2 in this regard. Almost no 10 minute horse riding, easy access to fast travel, animations aren\\'t as slow. It\\'s also much easier to access Savior Schnapps than in the first game, as well as food. It may not be for everyone, but I\\'d say that it should not stop you from trying the game if that\\'s what you\\'re afraid of. And if that\\'s still an issue... mods exist. Don\\'t like to rely on them to make the game playable, but it\\'s not like that. The game is fully playable for a casual player, far more than KCD1 was. It\\'s just extremely easy to install mods, so just know that you have that option.This is a great game, and one of the greatest RPGs I\\'ve played in a long while. It may not be for everyone, and that\\'s a good thing. More games should be \"not for everyone\". This is what AAA games are supposed to be. What every miserable small indie company like ubisoft wishes to have. A game with soul, made by people who love their work, people who have something to say and show. This is probably not only my Game of the year, but rather \"Game of the last 4 years\", since the last time I fell in love with a game this much was when Ghost of Tsushima released, and when I played Persona 5.Also, much love to Tom McKay and Luke Dale. Not only are they great and passionate voice actors, but great human beings as well, and I love every moment of their presence in-game, on social media and in game-related materials. I love these guys <3Now come on, you peasants. Your father\\'s sword won\\'t retrieve itself!  To the task!',\n",

Such as:- Animations dont play for Z\\'s and causing you to get confused, faked out (not intended function) and die (losing your character, forever...).- Character animations get stuck, causing you to never be able to run (and die)- Aiming animations (can\\'t aim weapons, guns, etc causing weird visuals and blocking POV for players)- Input / Action items and devices, being unable to use items or actions, such as healing in a pinch when seconds count to survive, getting stuck, dying.Simply you can play but you\\'ll die and lose your character, resetting perks.Zombies:Zombie animations, Running zombies, UNKILLABLE Zombies.- Zombie animations can be weird/faked out players as not intended function- Running zombies can \"Charge\" at you and teleport around, attacking you from 40-60-100 feet away, even tho your pings 20-40 and the server is US Based.- Unkillable zombies, Some zombies are SIMPLY unkillable. They won\\'t die, exploded, shotguns, rifles, hitting, they simply won\\'t die and when paired with running unkillable zombies while you are uncapable of running due to a animation glitch, you\\'re 100% dead every time.- Weird spawning zombies, running zombies, out of thin air. Sometimes zombies will simply spawn out of thin air, running, some unkillable, ending your game unfairly.Let\\'s be real: It\\'s a game. It\\'s not that important at the end of the day, but we pay for it and expect a certain level of playability... When you pay for something, you expect some resonable functionality.

       "  \"I first played this game back when it was on the Xbox One (2013), and put in about 100 hours. Once my friends decided to move on, I moved on as well. The game was a fun way to burn some time with some friends, there weren't many goals back then, let alone much of a story. I had some frames, some weapons, color palettes from holiday events, never spent a dime on the game. I decided to re-download it early last year to my PC, after getting curious as to how the game has changed, and also to get some nostalgia from a game I played a lot in High School. Wow so much has changed! I played through the new intro mission and was very surprised! This game has fleshed out quests now?! I was super excited, but the thought of grinding all over again for some frames felt daunting, especially after how they changed which planets give which frame blueprints, and they added so many more planets and missions compared to when I first played. So I put it down, and eventually uninstalled.Which brings us to January of this year. I heard there was cross save added around the end of 2023, and decided to give it a shot. When I set it up, I made it so that I kept my PC accounts progress, but also receiving all the items I had from Xbox. All I can say is.. Wow. I got what I had back, and replayed the missions. I was hooked. This game is incredible. The story, the combat, the world. This really feels like a passion project, and the art direction takes it to a new level. Every single item, warframe, and ability feel so incredibly unique in not only how they look, but also how they play and are used in the game. The combat is incredibly tight and responsive, and that paired with the movement really makes you feel like some futuristic space-ninja-wizard. The possibilities for builds are endless, and even though the current state of the game has an end game meta, everything is viable and usable. The story is a slow burn, and while it does take a long time to get into, it is extremely worth it. There were moments where I had goosebumps, especially towards the end. This definitely feels like some avant-garde mix match of sci-fi and fantasy and it blurs the lines so damn well, I cannot stress that enough. While the games core purpose is grinding to get upgrades, new warframes, weapons, etc, it still feels like as long as you have something building in your foundry, you will always have something new to try next time you log in. The micro-transactions in this game. There are three main ways to buy things in this game; One with in-game earned credits, the second is a premium currency purchased with real money called platinum, and the third is straight forward - just buying items with money through Steam. Almost everything can be earned in game, save for most of the cosmetics, but even getting the premium currency in the game is possible without spending any money. There is an active trading community that uses the premium currency, and it is surprisingly easy to get into. There are 3rd party websites, like Warframe Market, that list buying orders and selling orders, so it is easy to find someone that has what you need, or needs what you have. The premium currency can buy almost every item in the game using this method, and can also be used to speed up the foundry when crafting an item. The items that you buy straight through Steam are usually user-created items that Warframe has for sale as cosmetics, and it in part supports the creator. I have spent my fair share of money on this game, but the credit goes to the art department for making things look so good. This game is great. Addictive, fast, fun, interesting, rewarding. The grind won't be for everyone, but every hour and future hour I have in this game is well spent.9/10\",\n",

My PC runs demanding games like Fortnite, Call of Duty, and Destiny 2 flawlessly on high settings, but somehow this mess **** can’t stay stable even on the lowest settings and power-saving mode.I’ve updated my Nvidia drivers, my PC, and tweaked every possible setting—and the crashes still happen. On top of that, I get penalized for THEIR server issues, resulting in a 3.5-hour timeout. How is that fair? This is beyond frustrating and unacceptable. Whoever developed this needs to seriously reconsider how to properly launch a game because this is by far one of the worst releases I’ve ever seen. Fix your servers NOW or at least remove the penalties until the game actually works. This level of unprofessionalism is insane. Garbage devs actually',\n",

Я просто влюблен в эту игру и все, что она предлагает.\\n\\nВо-первых, геймплей \"Портала 2\" является истинным шедевром. Каждый уровень представляет собой головоломку, которую нужно разгадать, используя порталы и различные уникальные механики игры.

И в этом году такой игрой для меня стала BALATRO. В основе лежат правила покера, где необходимо собирать карты в комбинации, типа флэш, стрит, карэ и т.д. Чем сложнее собранная рука, тем больше очков за нее ты получишь, а чтобы победить в раунде нужно собрать определенное их количество. Все просто, однако весь интерес кроется в том, что есть множество дополнительных способов умножить их. Например благодаря джокерам, модифицированным картам, картам Таро и фишкам. Все перечисленное является случайным и поэтому каждая новая партия уникальна и приходится подстраивать свою тактику игры под те условия, что на руках именно сейчас. Приходится много думать и планировать наперед и это очень сильно затягивает. Пожалуй в BALATRO самый уникальный геймплей из всех представленных в ролике, а может быть и среди всех игр, вышедших в этом году. Поэтому я рекомендую игру всем тем кто устал от всех этих экшенов и киношек, и хочет поиграть во что-то действительно новое и уникальное.',\n",

I can't imagine that many employees have much love or respect for Halo, because the game doesn't feel like Halo, but more like Call of Duty. The gameplay never feels like the original Halo games and fails to feel satisfying or fun. Enemy predictability is outright removed, making you wonder why you died most of the time, whereas in the original Halo games, when you died, it was entirely the player's fault and you could always tell why or how you died. Combat in the original games were fun in close quarters and it was always a viable option. In Halo 4, the combat is mostly done in mid-range to long-range because of the poor level design and unpredictable and inconsistent AI. The story is decent, and the only notable thing about it is the humanisation of the previously stoic and closed off Master Chief and Cortana.\",\n",

       "  'I see pieces of Binding of Isaac everywhere, and let\\'s be honest...\\r\\n\\r\\nMuch like Rebirth, this game seems to be at odds with itself. It seems, in fact, to HATE itself.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere\\'s a part of the game that wants you to feel rewarded. It tries to instill in you satisfaction for clearing out a room with clever gunplay at a fast pace. It tries to reward you with guns it thinks will interest you or get a laugh. It\\'s rogue with potentially high rewards with your high risk, and it plays on that with Hegemony Points that, instead of locking unlock behind hidden random objectives, you may be able to unlock the item for a slim-to-none chance of it appearing in your run. And the dodge roll? It tries to make you feel like a total bad-ass being able to just leap over things and shoot. And blanks? Totally smart for timing those, right?\\r\\n\\r\\nIt falls spectacularly on it\\'s face with those elements. The game moves at a glacial pace, throughout the entire game. The guns don\\'t nearly make much of a different compared to the infinite ammo weapons it gives you, really. Occasionally does it make a difference, but as DPS rates, the gains are negligible, and even the smallest negative difference can get you killed.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet\\'s address the dodge roll:\\r\\nJust like exploring more of the map, it punishes you for doing this exact thing. Those of you who are reduced to hiding in a corner of a big room with pillars after killing an initial wave of enemies just to be severely outnumbered armed with almost nothing (or TOO MANY OF THE TIMES, carrying X amount of guns that basically make no difference), you know exactly what I mean. Dodge roll or not, you are f*cked. You are more than likely to land yourself in a WORSE position than before instead of getting to safety. You might as well just give up and die. Whatever hope you have, when you get 2.5 hearts destroyed in a single barrage simply because of a reposition from rolling, the game might as well stick a fork in your controller.\\r\\n\\r\\nBlanks:\\r\\nWhat\\'s the point of these? They throw enemies at you in an unreasonable rate to necessitate these maybe 3 times a floor. When they throw a Lead Maiden at you in a cramped room? You come back and tell me you didn\\'t need to use one of these. Go on. I\\'m waiting. See how useful they are when you have to face the Bullet King on 3 hearts and a bad gun. Using them makes almost no tangible difference in the positive direction, and not having them punishes you by depriving you even the slimmest chance of prevailing. Why even have them in the game? They feel so unrewarding.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo online co-op? Are you for real?\\r\\n\\r\\nOh, let\\'s actually address the co-op.\\r\\nCan you imagine yourself playing this game, with it\\'s negligible gun collection, dodge rolls that seem to punish you the more you use them, a map and room system that has exponentially diminishing return per room ventured into, and an outright terrible safeguard that are the blanks...with someone who is just as good as **** not rage? You might not even rage against the person who is putting up with this game for/with you, but the let-down itself will make this game a very unpleasant experience, let alone rage.\\r\\n\\r\\nAdd-bosses are a failure of game design.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, there\\'s a lot of potential here. The comedy is on point, and the art is cute. In fact, I loved these elements. But let\\'s emphasized that I used \"loved\", not \"love\". After the glacial pace of the game, and the constant \"more **** than difficulty\" barrage of enemies that feel less inspired each run of the game, I started to resent it. Why? Because it feels like they rubbed bacon salt on a wound. It\\'s like they said, \"The game hates itself, and it punishes you for playing it, but at least its adorable, right?\" That\\'s as worthless as saying \"The salt might sting, but at least it tastes like bacon!\" Cold comfort.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, I\\'m giving it a 6/10, because there\\'s still a lot of potential, and it\\'s =NEW=. As amazing Shovel Knight or the Binding of Isaac or Risk of Rain felt, they were just sloughs in the beginning, and nostalgia somehow got you through. I will admit, nostalgia did strike me in the heart and allowed me to put in more time than I otherwise would have. But nostalgia and attempts to be cute doesn\\'t save the game that just feels extremely unrewarding. I\\'m not exactly excited or interested in getting new guns. I don\\'t exactly take the risk of dodge rolling much as the i-frame makes no difference whatsoever, if not landing me in a more compromising position. I wasn\\'t exactly jonesing to explore the map to the maximum potential either. It didn\\'t feel like it rewarded skill at all, but rather luck. The game feels underhanded and Sisyphean...\\r\\n\\r\\nBut there is a LOT of potential. Maybe with more balance, such as reducing the amount of particles the enemy fires, or increasing the cooldown of the enemies, while reducing the cooldown/reload of our items/guns, would make it a lot more fun. But as it stands right now, I can\\'t recommend this game for anyone.\\r\\n\\r\\nWait a year and come back.',\n",

I let the 2nd one slide because they couldn\\'t out do the first game, but this one was just a sad excuse for dead space. I\\'ll give you some credit, because you made something new instead of just doing the same thing over and over again like call of duty is. I liked the co-op though, but what really made me mad was when there wasn\\'t a split screen. Seriously, that would be so much easier than playing with stupid people who are 5 year old children. I did like the \"Make your weapon\" feature that was a nice touch. But the suits in here really stunk I mean, there was nothing really that cool about these suits. I also liked the ammo, not ammo for a specific weapon. Would I recommend this?

This 5’5 lil gangster directed, wrote, produced, and composed the score (not to mention playing both of the main characters) for the single greatest comedic film ever made, and he did it all at a time when Gandhi was still alive.\\xa0The comedy of this film is beyond brilliant. Blending a dry subtlety with bouts of ferocious slapstick is no easy task, but harder still is tackling such prickly material (especially in his time) with such an exuberance of nuanced confidence that you ground everything in wondrous character work, build your farce upon that storytelling, and then deploy character and conversation driven comedy as the catalyst for the satirical goal. This film is a culmination of everything that comedy ought to be. Phenomenally directed, with a message that (while obviously relevant in all eras) spoke transcendent volumes in 1940, “The Great Dictator” not only features perhaps the greatest monologue in the history of film, but also contains one of the greatest performances I’ve ever seen from any actor, ever.

       "  \"Billy Wilder's iconic film Sunset Boulevard has very interesting characters with depths of psychology and gives a very hard critique of Hollywood's darker side. The industry is shown to be brutal and exploitative rather than attractive, which is a concept that I enjoy and is still relevant in today's industry. The cast of characters, each likable in their own special and sometimes imperfect ways, is what really sticks out to me in the entire movie. Norma Desmond, an emotional heroine caught in her past, is likable despite her delusions. She attempts to control Joe via riches by providing him with material luxuries like jewelry, clothing, and a luxury lifestyle in an effort to keep him around. Joe, on the other hand, knows this, but he is also hooked by Norma's comfort, which causes him to stay until the end. The psychological depth of both characters elevates the film, making it more than just a critique of Hollywood. It shows us the fragile egos, the desperation, and the moral compromises people make to survive in the industry. Even though this film is a dark comedy at heart, it feels strikingly real and contemporary, especially in its exploration of power dynamics and relevance. While a few scenes may feel slow or boring, the film remains entertaining throughout, showcasing its influence on countless Hollywood-centered films that followed. Wilder’s exploration of the darker sides of fame and ambition continues to be both relevant and captivating. Overall, I believe it's worth watching this film because it lets you freely create your own opinions on the characters and the whole industry itself.\",\n",

       "  \"Scarface (1983), directed by Brian De Palma and starring Al Pacino as the infamous Tony Montana, is a gritty, intense crime drama that explores the rise and fall of a Cuban immigrant who climbs the ranks of the Miami drug world with ruthless ambition. Pacino's electrifying performance and the film's unforgettable quotes, like “Say hello to my little friend,” have made Scarface a cult classic.

There are also so many emotions that you go through while watching this film, which is what I think makes this a very powerful way of adding to the story, almost as if you can feel what the characters are going through.

I may return to this one in the future just to see my take on it then, but for now I didn’t care for it. The lady that played Sara Goldfarb gave a magnificent (and I’m not using that term lightly) performance. During her scenes I felt disturbed in a way that could only be described as… cringe? But it wasn’t cringe it was just shocking. Only Saving Private Ryan has gotten that kind of reaction out of me before I saw this. So that tells me I need to rewatch this film some time soon, I think I’ll really enjoy it. Seeing Marlon Wayans in a movie other than scary movie (or just a comedy in general) made me laugh. That’s not to say he didn’t do a good job though, because he definitely did. Jennifer Connelly was just ok, and Jared Leto was decent. 2/5 stars.',\n",

I don't find the question hard to answer and it seems like some people just don't want to accept the simple truth that people in groups do awful things because they want to and/or because they want approval and because they think they will get away with it because everyone else is doing it too.

       "  \"This Anime Mononoke Hime is a 2 hour long movie. Ill start by saying this is a beautiful Story that will touch the heart of the viewer. The Story is about a young prince that gets cursed while saving his village, by law he must leave in search of the cure for his curse. The world he goes out to is not beautiful but he has a pure heart and a strong will. this movie is one of those that most anime enthusiast will find appealing. now lets get to business, Ill start by saying that this anime does a great job keeping upa suspenseful atmosphere, there's always something going on where the viewer will want to stick to it and continue watching, the music fills the scenery of the beautiful surroundings and takes you inside, blending in    with what is being portrait at the time.\\nthe art of the scenery is quite great and captivating, there are a few details that if you pay close attention some might see but so tiny it really doesn't matter.\\n the character art for the main characters is well done, however a lot of the other characters such as the villagers most look the same, a better job could have been done there but it does not take away from the greatness of the story.\\nThe characters, well what can I say they're interesting and by no means black and white, they all have things they want, they aren't necessarily good nor evil, which makes the entire movie making you wonder what they will do next, and making the characters  somewhat unpredictable. I feel this is gold nobody likes predictable characters. as far as the characters background and growth go, well there isn't much of that, it is after all only 2 hours, instead the characters reveal traits of their personality and intentions,  which is completely acceptable.\\non a small note there are few heads and arms flying off their respective bodies but you seem to forget it because of everything else going on and the story.\\n I rate this Anime movie a 9 on the scale, and that is very high, even for me but I feel this story is a classic, a beautiful story, and sends a message not only about how we are as humans but to also value the life of animals and nature as a whole, and that every living creature feels, just like any of us.\\n\\nRecommend: Yes, anyone who likes anime will enjoy this classic, and even those who normally don't could enjoy it a lot, because its that good. also this isn't bad for a child to watch if you find a censored version where they cut the scenes of heads and arms flying off, but even then I would still allow my child to watch it; just something for parents to keep in mind.\\n\\nPros: great art, touching and beautiful story, deep message, unpredictable characters, suspenseful, and good action all around.\\n\\nCons: they could have solidified the relationship between the main characters, they were kind of left in between one thing an another. I won't go into detail but you must watch and see for yourself.\\n\\n\\n I hope you find this review helpful and interesting, thanks for reading. \\n\\nSpecial thanks to TeruAsukaJaeger for the recommendation.\\n\\n if there are any reviews you guys want me to do, comment or inbox my profile.\",\n",

       "  \"it should be mixed review, but no such option on SteamThe good:- warships, and plenty of them- the gameplay is not too taxing - player doesn't need APM spam to play well- the game is not pay to win, despite some opinions, as any ship requires good player. Premium ship in bad hands won't do any good.The mixed:- grind - I hate grind in any game, but it's bearable here, mostly due to fact that you don't need to get to max tier asap to have fun. Most tiers are enjoyable as they are, no need to rush, unless you want to go competitive (clan and rank battles). I personally enjoy the journey, but it may not be suited for players who want to get to top quickly.- more grind - while the game labels itself free to play, it takes ages to get anywhere without premium account. The latter isn't overly expensive fortunately, but it's still almost false advertising.The bad:- time gated events - unless you devote most of your free time to play WoWs, you will miss on event rewards more often than not, depending on how much grind event requires. It's less annoying for good players, as they achieve more per game.- premium ships cost fortune - I easily spent over 400$ over a year of play, and even though it was by choice, it leaves bad taste in my mouth - free to play my a*se. I'd rather pay monthly and get most goodies free.- economy - many different currencies (silver, gold, coal, steel, tokens) with overblown value to force player to spend real money.- matchmaking - one can get into 10 game winning/losing streak easily, but it's no fun if game ends quickly, regardless of result. Distribution of players is questionable, also distribution of ship classes - many games with 4 vs 1 radar ships, and visibility/spotting is extremely important.The game has good appeal, but is marred by questionable design choices, and while not pay-to-win, it's clearly pay-to-have fun.\",\n",

I, however, am no film critic. I'm a simple guy donning simple tastes and battling with depression. Personally, I wish I never watched this. To my untrained ear, the music seemed monotonous throughout the series and continued to carry a tone of despair and solitude. Through my simplified vision, the art style seemed forced and uncomfortable. In my dull and shallow mind, the story felt overly romanticized and stagnant. Through my naivety, I blindly became attached to the characters, and forced myself to watchthem struggle through a life that is less than they deserve.\\n\\nI sit here, having finished the final episode, wondering why things end up the way they do, and why we are so powerless against it.\\n\\nThis review may be absolutely worthless to anyone who stumbles upon it, but I had to find somewhere to express my experience before I do something far more stupid on impulse.\",\n",
       "  'Angel Beats has convinced me that Jun Maeda doesn’t know how to write an original story. His previous hits Air, Kanon, and Clannad have been about a bunch of mentally and/or physically broken high school girls who all fall in love with a guy whose only significant character trait is that he exists, and along the way one of these girls will die of a mysterious illness. For Angel Beats, Maeda twists his tried and true formula by having all the characters dead to begin with, and stuck in some sort of high school purgatory, where a group of high school students shoot a littlegirl in the kneecaps for no good reason.\\n\\nAs mentioned earlier, Maeda’s stories are very formulaic. First, he establishes a cast of one dimensional, but likeable characters, and a zero dimensional main character who is designed to be a self insert for the viewer. He then lulls the viewers into a false sense of security with a couple of comedic episodes before dropping a tragedy bomb. In time the main character recovers from the tragedy and an asspull miracle occurs, to ensure a happy ending and negating any kind of character development. Angel Beats follows this same formula to an extent, however due to last minute budget cuts; this had to be crammed into 13 episodes making the production feel rushed and uneven. \\n\\nA lot of fans will defend the show by saying that it would have been more coherent had it been given 26 episodes. I don’t buy this. Maeda had a lot of options. He could have told half the story and left it open to a probable second season. He could have cut some of the characters or spend less time recycling the same gags (suicide rushes, rocket chairs, etc.) to make more room for character growth. It’s possible to tell a great story in 13 episodes or less. Haibane Renmei told a similar purgatory story in 13 episodes, and the world was much deeper, and the characters more sympathetic. Baccano had a huge cast, yet all the characters got their time to shine, without taking away from the story. \\n\\nIn addition, there is never a really good explanation for why they’re fighting Tenshi. They make her out to be evil incarnate at first, but quickly find out that she’s actually a normal girl. Yet rather than do their research, Yuri somehow convinced everyone to build an underground factory, stockpile weapons, and hold rock concerts just to fuck with everyone’s dinner time. If you stop to think about it, the war on Tenshi was nothing more than pointless bickering started by a petulant bitch. Using the budget cuts to defend the trainwreck of a story is like when high school student complain that they would have done better on a test had they gotten more time. Sometimes, you just have to admit that you didn’t know what you were doing.\\n\\nWhile the music for the show was decent, part of me felt it was a ploy to milk more money out of the show. Some of the early episodes focused on a band called Girls Dead Monster who played music as some sort of distraction. However, because they weren’t central to the plot, and because singles were being released so frequently while the show was airing, it all felt like a cheap cash-in to ride the wave of success of K-ON.\\n\\nSo if I hated the story so much, why did I stick with it? Simply, it’s because I’m a big fan of the director, Seiji Kishi. He previously did Seto no Hanayome and Tentai Senshi Sunred, which are two of my favorite comedy series. I could see that a lot of effort went into the animation. The lighting and movement was dynamic and smooth. The backgrounds were nicely detailed and had a pleasing color palette. Unfortunately, none of this could save the production from its terrible story. Part of me feels the director was overcompensating for the terrible story by blinding the audience with pretty pictures. This seems to have worked on a large portion of the fanbase since a lot of reviews I have read comment on how pretty it is while glossing over the failure of the story.\\n\\nAfter watching Angel Beats and seeing the audience reaction to it online, I feel like it’s done its job of manipulating its audience with false emotions. It’s a formula that has worked for previous Key works, and their sales of figures and dakimakura prove it. Fans of the show that actually finished this review rather than marking it “unhelpful” and moving on, watch the show again. Is it actually unique, or is it the same trite, repetitive crap that’s been plaguing the anime industry for years? Does the story make sense, or is it full of more holes than a cheese grater? But most importantly, is it actually good or are you still lying to yourself?',\n",

Mainly NPC forgetting about events after quest ends, but I'll happily let that slide.Sound design and music is breathtaking same as the first game. It really supports the overall scene and feel of the game.Graphics: well i thought the first game looked stunning with its amazing forest lighting. I was wrong. You'll find lots of details in texture and lighting, that really can make the differenceSTORY: catching, meaningful, dramatic, yet grounded in reality is all I¨m gonna say to avoid spoilersGameplay: the game doesn't hold your hand. you have to learn it both in game, but also hone your skills and understanding of mechanics. It feels very rewarding, unless you over do it and you become overpowered (maniacal laugh here)Sword play: theres a BUTTON for dodging!!! + masterstrikes = easier, yet not lacking in depthOverall I'd strongly recommend the game to anyone who likes medieval times, history, some challenge, and is fed up with all the hero-gamesI want to add that I got the game for free as a reward for beta testing. But im still buying the game, to support the devs, and the steel book looked nice\",\n",

       "  'No, it isn\\'t anything to do with the capital of Azerbaijan... I came into Bakuman. on the back of \"Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-Kun\", and I expected something similar - light comedy revolving around manga. Bakuman. isn\\'t like that at all. Instead, it\\'s an uplifting tale about the pursuit of ambitions and dreams, and compelling enough that you should be hooked from the first episode. If you read the synopsis and liked the idea, go and watch it now - you won\\'t be disappointed. Bakuman.\\'s story isn\\'t ground-breaking, but it is extremely well executed. The relentless pacing of the anime is excellent in creating the idea of progress towardsthe character\\'s goals, especially during the start of the show. The show isn\\'t afraid to show the character\\'s hardships either, which makes the successes ever sweeter, and hooks the viewer into the cycle of ups and downs that is making manga. Bakuman.\\'s story is a very, very enjoyable ride.\\n\\nHowever, the story would be nothing without memorable characters to act it out, and Bakuman. has these in spades. The central duo, Mashiro and Takagi, are extremely likeable, with infectious enthusiasm and energy throughout, and although I can\\'t say much without giving away some sort of plot detail, the show\\'s supporting cast are equally brilliant. Bakuman.\\'s characters are possibly its greatest strength - you sympathise with them, and invest yourself in their various struggles. No matter what sort of character you identify with in anime, someone in Bakuman. is guaranteed to strike a chord.\\n\\nArt and Sound are good enough. The OP, \"Blue Bird\" is catchy enough, and fits the mood down to the ground. Bakuman.\\'s music becomes familiar, and gets an almost pavlovian response once you\\'ve heard it enough. Art is consistent too, though I personally think that it improves in the later series. I\\'m not qualified enough to say whether it\\'s a beautifully drawn masterpiece or just serviceable, but it looks good to me.\\n\\nTo conclude, Bakuman. is a great anime. Its characters are well-written, its story is well-executed, and the fabulous pacing makes its message inspirational. Maybe it just struck a chord with me, but watching the characters sweat to make their dreams happen made me want to do the same - it really is that good. I pulled all-nighters to watch Bakuman., and I can\\'t think of a better recommendation than that.',\n",

       "  'Usually I would get bored when a show follows a formula that makes things typically predictable – especially when it comes to the mystery and thriller genres. I am an avid psychological mystery thriller fan who loves gore and violence. When I happened to stumble upon this show, my first thoughts were, the title sounds like something a psychological series. Consequently, my instincts were incorrect. First impressions are everything; when I first saw the trailer, it did not really show any affection to me. Good thing that I would try almost anything and gave this a shot and to my surprise, words alone could notexpress the god-like comedy experience that you get from watch this series.\\n\\nStory (9/10)\\n\\nAlthough it is repetitive and follows a formula, every single episode was done delicately and will give you a different kind of amusement every time. This was meant to be a parody type of show so it is meant to imitate another show, company, and so on and turn it into something funny – in a way, a mocking manner.  The satires, the irony, the stereotypes and the exaggerations are never-ending. \\n\\nThis is how to do a show with a repetitive plot. It gives the viewers a kind of sensation that, nonetheless of the predictability of the series, makes people hold on and not to give up on the show and would actually expect more and want more. \\n\\nArt (8/10)\\n\\nThe art suits the style of the anime with all the exaggerated scenes – to the point of actually feeling to be inside a fantasy within a fantasy. They did a great job in the character designs; especially the girl with a skull hair clip. As mentioned, it is a parody anime so some characters may appear stereotypical or looks like something you have seen before. The demon girl, if you look close enough, looks somewhat like the girl from Elfen Lied. The guy looks like a typical intelligent nerd in a fantasy. The rest, looks like a typical girl that you see in a fantasy or harem anime. Despite of the uncanny resemblance, it suited the theme of the show – a show with a divine comedy.\\n\\nSound (10/10)\\n\\nEverybody has their own taste in music. The show has a combination of modern and operatic twist to it. If you are an opera or Victorian fan, you will find yourself addicted to its music. The themesong would start out as something modern and techno and it would seamlessly shift into something operatic. Furthermore, the music suited the god theme in the series. Listening to the music will make you shiver down your spine and feel like the feeling of being a god flow into your bloodstreams. Other than that, the show has a couple of modern pop sounding song. It was not really special nor is it that bad. It just suited the scene of a typical modern pop culture.\\n\\nCharacter (10/10)\\n\\nThe art, the story and the music are great but what makes anime or any kind of show stand out is the characters. A gloomy intelligent nerd who does not care about the 3D world and shows no real emotions towards the girls in real life despite the fact of making them fall in love with him, an innocent childish sibling that is trying hard to make his big brother happy and endless stereotypes of girls.',\n",

I have played multiple maps in the play sessions I've had recently and it's been bug free and the newer content is pretty sweet.  I want to give credit where it's due, the game is probably better than it's ever been.  I don't think it would be fair to leave my review up unedited.  Changing my review to recommended, good job!Everything from below here is from back in 2021, disregard please :)________________________________________________________________________I have a bit over 200 hours played in this game, and for the most part it's a fantastic game.  The game is well thought out, has great mechanics, and is overall incredibly fun.  It's easily one of the best hunting games ever.Unfortunately, I can't recommend this game to anyone.  I'm sick and tired of games being bug ridden and completely unpolished.  Whenever there is a major update, parts of the game that worked, in some cases for years, suddenly break.  There is absolutely no sense of urgency to fix these bugs as it can take months before some of them get fixed (if ever).  I'm not talking about small bugs either, I'm talking completely game breaking problems.  There are crippling audio issues, fast travel not working on half of the maps, frame rates suddenly being cut in half with no rhyme or reason on certain maps (less taxing ones, /boggle), unable to use hunting stands on half the maps, etc.  It's ridiculous!  It feels like I'm playing an alpha to a game sometimes.  With the release of the latest map, it feels like the game is at one of it's worst states yet.  Makes it very difficult to enjoy the game.Update 8/14/2021:  It has now been since July 1st, 2021 when the game was last updated.  So, going on a month and a half without a single issue addressed since the release of the latest map.  And once again, these aren't problems with the latest map itself, for some reason when new content is pushed in theHunter: COTW, the existing game suffers for...reasons I guess.../shrug.  Is this game going the way of theHunter: Primal?  They push an update that breaks the game and they just abandon it?\",\n",

       "  'first review on here, pretty long and un-organized, but I hope it can entertain some of you (also, my native tongue is not English, so forgive me for I have almost surely made some mistakes) First of all: I don\\'t watch many seinen-animes. I just don\\'t like these fantasy/sci-fi/monster/robot-plots and ideas. They always seem kind of childish and most of the time it\\'s just violence for the sake of violence with the supernatural element trying to be a justification. Don\\'t get me wrong, both sci-fi and fantasy are legitimate genres and I can completely enjoy an \"unrealistic\" universe if the rules within the diegesis are coherentand there is a genuine, not-too-far-fetched idea behind it. For example I really enjoy distopian stories like shinkansekai yori or fantasy elements in stories like the one of kokoro connect.\\nKiseijuu: Sei no Kakuritsu was, for me, an enjoyable anime just because of the fact that I watched every episode of it. It is very flawed and this review is 90% negative, but I can\\'t shy away from the fact that I did like it somehow. Most of the time, with these monster stories, I can\\'t even finish the first episode (I do try!).\\nspoilers, duh\\nIt is a partly childish premise: Parasites just happen to come to a particular town in Japan (and to nowhere else on the Planet) and it turns out that they do not only love to eat humans, but they also kill them in a very brutal manner so we get some violence on the screen instead of just having them be efficient like the indicated intelligence of them would suggest. I can put up with this because the anime does not leave it at that but tries to implement philosophical question going along with it: what is human nature, what is a life worth, are humans worth more than animals, how can you justify eating them while judging parasites for eating humans, aren\\'t humans the true parasites to this planet?\\nThese questions are stated at the beginning of the anime and they are dealt with pretty – o.k.- for the first few episodes. Then they are just dropped for the majority of the series and replaced by hollow set phrases. Only at the end of the show these questions get picked up again and are a liiiittle bit deeper explored but the show just does not use them to their full potential - I mean, these questions are not new. If you wanna take part in a very frequented debate which takes place pretty much all around the world you just need to add some new ideas and perspectives. Well, none of that. Yet it IS enough to make for an pretty OK monster-anime. Like always, it could have been much better, and like often times, it should have been.\\nLet\\'s get to the main character. At first, he is a relate-able character, not too nerdy, not too ballsy, he is not constantly picked on and also not loved by each- and every one. It is pretty rare for a seinen-show (and modern anime in general) to have these black-and-white, cliché characters and I am thankful that Kiseijuu: Sei no Kakuritsu did not do that (at first). Then he gets confronted with all these supernatural and horrifying events taking place around him and he has to deal with it because he is part of it. He remains relate-able and believable. He asks questions, he struggles with reality, he wants to be strong and mature about it but fails at plausible points.\\nThen he gets killed and his parasite is able to repair him because parasites can do pretty much anything if it is convenient for the story and maybe, at a later point, they won\\'t be able to anymore (if it is convenient for the plot, eeeey). I mean, how can Migi just replace his heart and then go back to being his arm and suddenly there is a heart again. I thought Migi would just be his heart for the rest of the series and he would be missing his right arm for the rest of the series. In many ways that would have made the character development taking place later on much more plausible and unique.\\nThen he just regenerates his body for a few days and as he wakes up, he is a completely different character. He just did a full 180 kick flip on a wave board. I understand that he does not need glasses anymore and his senses are sharper, that\\'s a nice idea. But why is he fucking ripped like a wrestler after basically sleeping for a week. The body develops muscles if you fuckin use them, and only then. He could have just trained and be really efficient at it, because he has superhumanly senses now, but nah, he just wakes up ripped and with a more masculine facial structure because plot convenience. Oh and he hasn\\'t shat himself or even peed. Migi did feed him, right?\\nAfter that his character is:\\n&gt;people get murdered all around me the whole time and are turned into mincemeat and I am mildly upset about it for a few minutes\\n&gt;my mom died and my whole world is in shatters and I am concerned but basically it\\'s ok.\\n&gt;lol, I am lying in between dead bodies and these guys totally think I am dead too, rofl ( thats a bit later but it fits)\\nAnd everyone tells him that: wow, you are different, you are like a complete cliché now, you boring piece of seinen-main-character\\nA few days later he remembers that and has a hard time beliving it, because he didn\\'t even notice, so we get a montage of retrospectives of people telling him that like we needed the anime to explain to us the completely flat main character and his uninteresting behaviour like we didn\\'t had to cope with it for two episodes now.\\nIt does make sense for him being that way, at least a little, but it just makes for a main character I do not care about and a fuckin cliché.\\nHis main bitch does not really like that either and he really wants to explain it to her, but migi does not let him do that because for sure Satomi (her name) would tell the police. hmh.\\nBut his side hoe also need to now the truth and he finds a way to tell her without migi noticing it. Because migi sleeps 4 hours a day. wow. he has a 4-hour-window each day to use and tell his dad and his girlfriend about his secret and jet he only manages to tell Kana; which should be the person he least cares abut.\\nI know that the anime tries to explain this by her completely unexplained ability to feel parasites but she thinks she just feels the presence of ther true love so Shinichi has to explain it to her so she does not constantly put herself in danger.\\nUh but she does anyway.\\nBesides, Kana is one of the most unbelievable characters ever. She lives in a room which looks like it belongs to a 12-year-old princess-loving girly girl, she dreams and behaves like that as well, while in fact she hangs around a pretty violent street gang. On these occasions she behaves like she hangs around a street gang. Her ability to feel parasites has no reason to exist (other than plot convenience) while later in the anime, the mass-murderer dude has a very nice and plausible explanation for the same ability. She is cute tho. \\nThen Shinichi manages to convince migi to enlighten another human being about her existence. And he is an detective. So the risk of being exposed to the police or government is quite high; certainly higher that with his dad or his girlfriend. But that turns out ok. The detectives dies tho, and Shinichi is mildly upset about that for a few seconds.\\nAnd jet still he does not manage to tell Satomi. He rather breaks up with her and has a reason to be mildly sad some times. How convenient for the plot. Other then that there is not much wrong with Satomis character and she was somewhat of the character I could identify with. She should be a lot more traumatized but that goes for every character on the show (except Shinichis dad, he seems to be really devastated, which is also a plus) - she has a reason to be in love with our hero, she has a reason to be confused about him while staying interested nonetheless. \\nThe last major issue I have with the show are the way humans fight against parasites. At the beginning of the show, when a parasite enters the school as a \"transfer student\", the girl who falls for this guy soon finds out about his identity and confronts him. She is a very clever girl (no sarcasm) and protects herself with acid and it turns out that it works pretty well to stun and weaken parasites. Good thinking. Her brother is a policeman involved in the very investigation about this whole thing and she knows it. Yet she does not feel the need to tell him that she found out about this method, or maybe she did but the police didn\\'t care. That is unlikely and it would have needed some explanation why they decided to drop the idea.\\nShnichi tells the police at a later point that flame-throwers would be his weapon of choice against these monsters because he knows it is their weakness. First of all: he didn\\'t even use fire against his numerous enemies of that sort until the final boss. Second of all: the police laugh this idea off and then proceed to use every possible option and advantage they could get against the parasites. They seem pretty desperate and they are even vocal about it at some later point. Wouldn\\'t it have made sense to at least bring some flame-throwers, in case things get a little bit messy? The man who is the head of the operation knows that Shinichi is hiding something, that he knows something, but he does not believe that the flame-thrower idea was more than just a wild guess. How convenient, because only trough this, they aren\\'t able to defeat the strongest parasite.\\nThen, the boss battle.\\nThe only reason Shinichi wins this is because apparently parasites have no possibility to sense humans through sound or smell. This is just not believable. On the one hand, genes of this very species enabled Shinichi to get superhumanly senses (and strength), but on the other hand, this species isn\\'t able to use this gene-material for them selves; which would be pretty nice for hunting humans, you know, they eat them They are designed to kill humans and yet they just can\\'t smell them. Uhm, what?\\nThen, shinichi is fast enough to attack and seriously injure his foe by simply stabbing him with a pipe. Even with migi, and he is without migi at this point, he was not fast enough to get a hit in, Gotou was just faster and superior in every way. When he stabs him, Gotou does not even try to react. Yeah, he was already injured, but so was Shinichi, and Gotou even had more time to recover. He wins. And, oh, Migi is back. He is not a cripple.\\n\\nThen the last 10 minutes of the show are basically unnecessary, but fail at trying to give the whole thing a deeper meaning.\\n\\nSo why did I even enjoy the anime?\\nBecause it was okey. Mainly, because it was exiting and managed to keep the tension up in every episode. I cringed and shook my head often times, but it was just good enough for me to klick on the link for the next episode. Also it did a good job at conveying emotion, even though some of these emoitions could have been avoided or dealt with in a more siutable manner if the characters would have been a little smarter. Some fights are pretty good and are executed in an unpredictable and exiting way. The story itself lacks a bit of deapth and plausible development, I mentioned that, but it\\'s not too flat and has its moments.\\nObjectively, it is maybe a 4 or 5 out of 10. The art was nice. The music was sometimes good, sometimes not soo good.\\nMy enjoyment was pretty high, at 8 maybe.\\nAnd for a monster/seinen anime, it was somewhat above avarage, because this genre is mostly far-fetched bullshit.\\nhate me',\n",

Unless you are Mars of Destruction, there is bound to be people who truly appreciate the anime. However, I\\'ve never run across an anime with such radical sides as Angel Beats!, and probably never will. So for the reader, a word of caution. If you don\\'t love it, you\\'ll hate it. If you don\\'t hate it, you\\'ll love it. This is an anime where its isn\\'t just \"liked\\'. Based on my scores you can probably tell which sideof the fence I stand on, so rather than taking my review and running with it, use it as a guide to form your own opinion, whether it be with it or against it.\\n\\nAngel Beats is another Key powerhouse anime, but differs in that it is not adapted from a visual novel and is only 13 episodes. Angel Beats involves the concept of a \"limbo\" in the form of a high school where young adults go when they live an unfulfilled life or lose there memories and get lost. One such person from the second category is Otonashi. Upon arriving and not knowing who he is, he is pulled into a rebel group that breaks the rules of the school. The reason for this is because if they follow the rules, the will pass on, and the group believes if the rebel they can stay \"alive\". However, the student council president, nicknamed Angel, fights the group to the death regularly (since they are already dead they can\\'t die). The story also contains very tragic back stories for the characters as well as side stories, but ultimately fails to have a main central plot. This is the main reason it is bashed. However, as many series don\\'t have plots and succeed, Angel Beats makes up for it in full with the other four categories.\\n\\nThe art of Angel Beats is consistently gorgeous, which is hard to find in itself. While other series save the good graphics until it counts, Angel Beats has it throughout, and when a moment comes where it \"counts\", the art is beyond gorgeous. such as the band sequences or the xmas tree scene (remember this!). \\n\\nI honestly don\\'t know where to start with the soundtrack other than saying its the best I have heard in anime, by a clear mile. With beautiful flowing melodies such as \"My Most Precious Treasure\", exciting tracks like \"Theme of SSS\", kickass Girldemo inserts like \"Crow Song\", and a beautiful OP and ED, the soundtrack is nothing short of perfection.\\n\\nThe characters of Angel beats can be overwhelming. The characters are in all shapes and sizes, not one alike even in personality. This is truly unique in that its hard for characters to have original personality when there are so many characters. The only problem that I may have is that there were a few that lacked a back story, but with the important characters explained, it leaves the mind to wonder for itself, which can be a good thing.\\n\\nAngel Beats is not only a fast-paced yet hysterical action comedy, but it is quite possibly one of the most emotional dramas you will find. Without spoiling anything, Angel Beats has easily one of the most tear-jerking and emotional endings in anime, as if to reward the viewer. And like I said in the beginning, this is a guide. It is up to you to find out if you like it. Personally, this is my all-time favorite anime, and will be for a long time.',\n",

After episode 8, with stilllittle to no explanations, I was beginning to wonder how everything would end up because there were only three more episodes left to reveal Nine\\'s and Twelve\\'s pasts, as well as their reasons for wanting to leave bombs that didn\\'t actually hurt anyone all over the city. And my fears were right. I felt that their reasons, while touching (my heart is already in a fragile state thanks to Tokyo Ghoul), were a little bit too petty for my liking, and I found it hard to believe that the two of them would go through SO MUCH trouble just because of THAT. (&lt; being purposely vague because spoilers suck.) \\n\\nIn the end, ZnT had a pretty mediocre story that didn\\'t live up to the suspense it had built up from the beginning.\\n\\nCharacters: 6/10 \\n\\nSo maybe I was a little unrealistic in my expectations for character development. Nine and Twelve were interesting for me in the beginning, but they quickly became boring after Ep. 8. I don\\'t know, I wanted more from Nine (I have a soft spot for him... he\\'s kind of hot, okay), though I did sort of like his smart-silence personality. And Twelve... WHAT HAPPENED TO MY CREEPY BABY? He had SO much potential in being a crazy but lovable psycho, but nope, after meeting Lisa he became Mr. Sweetie Hero. \\n\\nWhich brings me to Lisa. Frankly, Lisa was a disappointment. I wanted more character development in her, because she remained pretty much the same throughout the entire anime: dull, one-dimensional, and weak. Look, I *don\\'t* have a thing against weak characters -- but I want them to be properly done so that I can sympathize with them. For Lisa, apart from giving us a brief background of her family, that was pretty much it. I don\\'t see what was so charming about her, or why Twelve risked his long-standing friendship with Nine for her in the first place. \\n\\nIt\\'s not to say that I hate the Twelve + Lisa ship, because I don\\'t. I just feel that Lisa could have been crafted into a much more interesting character, even if she was weak, and maybe then it might have better justified Twelve\\'s actions in Ep. 8. \\n\\nAs for Five... talk about a drama queen. She was another character I found super badass when she first appeared (that hairdo, though), but after what she did in Ep. 10? I\\'m just-- I can\\'t understand it. I can\\'t understand why a girl with such a brilliant mind would choose to do that because it doesn\\'t fit in with her character at all. \\n\\n---\\n\\nI seem to be the black sheep here, though, so maybe I\\'m being a little too picky with an anime that\\'s only 11 episodes long. Still, I do think that Zankyou no Terror could have been a lot better done if some things hadn\\'t happened. *cough* Anyway, I still did enjoy myself while watching this, so my overall score is 7/10. I\\'m just crying for the lost potential. \\n\\nBut, uh, on the bright side, at least the music is beautiful? YOKO KANNO, EVERYONE. Go search up \"Walt\" and prepare to have your mind blown.']}"

       "  'I am sure that many of us are always tempted to see a show hearing so many great things about it,and personally for me a mystery one is always a good pleasure,if it is done correctly. Unfortunately,Hyouka fails for me at everything I want to see in a mystery. The \"story\" is the major weakness of this anime: I personally disliked every mystery that was presented with the exception of the one about the culprit and the footage,which was okay. The cases themselves have no importance at all and could be easily avoidedas they are just a waste of time and a way of showing the great detective skills of the male protagonist.\\n  Apart from lame mysteries we have just boring events presented,such as festivals or whatever and again with no importance at all.      \\n\\n   Then the characters are nothing special either:\\n\\n  For me Houtarou is just a wannabe relatable character for the introverts and lazy people.While I myself being one identify a little with him he ended up as a disappointment.\\n  The rest are just plain annoying and useless  and I didn\\'t find anything special about them to even present them. \\n\\n   The animation is perhaps the single and the strongest point of the series and I have to admit it was very good especially how they designed different stuffs while Oreki was resolving something.\\n\\n   The sound is decent but to be honest with the exception of the first opening it wasn\\'t anything good either.\\n\\n    Overall:Hyouka is a very lame and disappointing anime and only thanks to the animation and the first opening is good at something,so I can\\'t help but give it a 2 and if you are a fan of mystery I am very doubtful that you will enjoy this one.',\n",

       "  'This is a review from a Destiny 1 veteran, written just a few days after the Lightfall expansion has dropped. Destiny 2 is a first-person shooter with abilities, co-op, pvp, and huge and constantly expanding world. The good parts of this is the best feeling gunplay in the industry, and this is coming from a person  who grew up and COD, Halo and tried many, many new FPS shooters to come out in the last ten years. the abilities and builds are constantly changing and powerful, and definitely add to the flavour of the game and truly make Destiny, Destiny. the player versus player is extremely fun, with insane amounts of guns and builds to choose from. Even if Bungie does occasionally screw the balance horribly, but that adds to the experience to an extent. If you want amazing gunplay, awesome and cool abilities, outstanding co-op AND good pvp (although not as big of a focus as the co-op content), then Destiny is definitely for you.but where are the downsides? I\\'ll tell you. I would say Destiny 2 is an \"easy to learn, hard to master\" type of game. Bungie has put lots of effort and resources into improving the new player experience, and in Lightfall, I think they have finally made a \"good\" new player introduction system. D2 is intricate with many layers of lore, gameplay and buildcrafting, and quests that can overwhelm new players with all the content, with no where to really know where to start. Lightfall\\'s changes only partially solve these problems. Other problems include PVP content draught, FOMO, and no in game LFG system (coming later this year), although Bungie has partially alleviated these problems with Lightfall and previous changes, they are still definite problems the community wants fixed.Destiny 2 is a great, incredibly fun game especially with friends and I\\'d recommend the game to anyone who wants THE BEST fps mmo game. impeccable co-op (amazing end game, not like anthem), great pvp, and awesome gameplay. even with the problems new players might have without a friend to guide them, and the other problems I mentioned before, D2 is a fun game with near limitless potential to grow and become better. So, Lightfall. You may have heard very negative feedback so far about this expansion. The critiques the community has for the DLC are completely valid and I overwhelmingly agree. The campaign, while fun, was a narrative letdown. However, the quality of life features, the new subclass strand, the difficulty overhaul and seasonal model changes are definitely positive. If people ignore the campaign, I\\'d say lightfall so far is a very good DLC. as someone who played shadowkeep and beyond light, Lightfall is better. On top of that, beyond light didn\\'t stop evolving and adding content in the first week. After the raid was beaten new content and exotics were released, so I assure you we have definitely not seen all of Lightfall just yet.This is my first review I have ever put effort into, so I truly hope you enjoyed and found this informative.',\n",

Since day one a lot of people say Valve is only collecting data to stop the cheaters, but thats either completely false or just doesnt matter because its taking way to long. Pretty much 3/4 competitive games are full of cheaters, it just makes no sense to even try to play at the moment. Its feels like there is no anti cheat at all and i never have experienced anything like this at all, and dont forget this isnt a small or new game. I can only advise everyone to dont play at all until its fixed and I am not even have a little hope that its changing anytime soon. So play something else guys or cheats for yourself, it doesnt matter, at the end you will only find HvH games. Its not worth the time...',\n",
       "  'Now that I have fully seen the Anime, it just validates my points. The viewer never finds out why the main characters, especially Kaguya, act this awfully. There is literally no plot and so no reason for them not to confess their love. This is easily the most boring and sensless romcom I have ever watched. (Not the worst though) This Anime had a great premise. At the first episode I got hyped over two dominant characters and creative brainbattles! No one can deny, that the animation is really the peak of this anime. But animations isn\\'t everything... In the same exact episode, the premise drops 10stories down, when I realized, Kaguya isn\\'t really dominant. In fact, many scenes show, that she wants to be dominated by Miyuki. \\nThe two main characters are just bland and at most times hopeless. Their actions are laughable, cause they act soooooo cool, while being dumb as hell. The brainbattles were keeping this Anime on a 5 for me. But it is hard to say they are genius, when the characters are just laughably stupid. I changed my score to a 3, after watching these two screaming and whining like little toddlers because of a shortcake for 7 minutes. And Kaguya laughing about the word \"wiener\" for 5 minutes... \\n\\nIt is like seeing two people act like they have an IQ of 130, while they are as dumb as those antivax karens on facebook. It isn\\'t funny. Yeah I said it. It isn\\'t funny. Ai, Kaguya\\'s maid, was literally how I felt watching the anime. \\n\\nWhen people say, this is as genius as death note, they couldn\\'t have possibly watched death note. Or they say, it is the best romcom. Did they watch Toradora? Golden Time or Bunny girl senpai? Or actual genius comedies that use stereotypes and break them: Sora no Otoshimono.\\n\\nAnd everything I write here isn\\'t really a spoiler, cause you can see this from miles away by just watching episode 1 or 2. \\n\\nThe main characters became kinda annoying. Cause there is literally NO reason why Kaguya acts this way other than plot convenience. Miyuki has actual dominant thoughts and makes his actions kinda believable. But it is just convenient for him, that Kaguya shapes herself to become \"non dominant\" to be his type of girl. Heck! EVERY STEREOTYPICAL JAPANESE MAN STEREOTYPICAL GIRLFRIEND. He doesn\\'t even have to move his little pinky for her to become his girl. And by the end, again, this anime became like every stereotypical, bland romance, in which the girl blushes hard and is too stupid to confess to senpai. And again, you can see, that this is the ending by just watching episode 1 or 2.\\n\\nIt is a tale as old as time: The main characters are both so socially awkward, it hurts. And all their problems vanish, when they just become a couple. They are each others saviors. And by the end of the anime the girl becomes everyones desired stereotypical girlfriend, who blushes, wants to be dominated, stays at home, takes care of the children, cooks and by the end of any anime, loses her whole character. It is concerning that still so many people love that type of storytelling and still don\\'t get how one sided the main girls are written in Anime. And how blind, boring and socially stupid Anime protagonists are written.\\nWhy is it so hard to create anime guys and girls, that aren\\'t so friggin stereotypical and hopeless?\\n\\nI just hope, that people, who like this anime, don\\'t think, that being like those characters is desirable or entertaining.',\n",
       "  \"Viewed as an evolutionary leap that broke the boundaries of the medium and redefined DEEP in a post-cyberpunk setting, a similar reality to ours, it is one of few avant-garde (innovative, experimental, unorthodox) titles ever made by the Japanese anime industry that forces their audience to actually use their brain for the entire duration of the show. None before it has taken the same concepts and themes introduced in the movie Ghost in the Shell (1995) to unreachable heights in the same time span, has the same amount of disagreements among the staff about what the heck they made, is purely a mindscrew thatrequired thorough analysis of every scene of every episode, including the stock footage, \\nshows the story mainly through dialogues and symbols\\nand has little/no superficial entertainment.\\n\\nSTORY SECTION - 9.75/10 (Is this all real?)\\nPlot, Content, Logic - 4/4\\nSet in modern times, boundary between virtual and actual reality is gradually blurred with the development and increased usage of technology in society with PCs, handheld devices, video games, social networking, and the ever-expanding computer network, called “The Wired”. A hacker organization, led by Eiri Masami, attempts to unify humanity into “The Wired” through the collective unconscious so the virtual and actual reality cannot be distinguished. This is justified with the unknown effects of Earth’s magnetic fields (Schuman Resonance), Psi ability of humans, evolution, etc. To achieve this, the only heroine Lain Iwakura must comply with the wishes of the said organization and live only in the Wired. \\n\\nSpoiler or not, that is the plot and is more realistic than NGE’s Instrumentality with similarities from the original movie Ghost in the Shell (1995). No need for cyborgs, mechs, supernatural BS, and the distant future; just real science, philosophy, and psychology with a dash of conspiracy theories and a few major twists (e.g. fantasy/religion, reality as a whole).\\n\\nAs the title suggests, this is a series of unique experiments (one per episode), focused mostly on LAIN (not just Lain Iwakura), that revolves around its central theme, perception. The material is openly presented through minimal storytelling in the form of monologues, open-ended dialogues, anonymous characters, symbols, and psychedelic and surreal imagery so nothing is absolute. By watching at face value, there are plot holes because the viewer’s vision throughout the entire series is limited. Thus, the audience is forced to make their own interpretations to fill those holes and complete their “reality” of the series while answering its questions about identity, memories, time, existence, morality, concept of God, and more controversial topics. This alone is not confusing enough without the common schizophrenic hallucinations, stagnant or creepy atmosphere, and subtle lies. Add as well the cynical yet fairly accurate criticism of our dependence with technology because of the lack of live communication (or abundance of chats in “The Wired”), insecurity and isolation, apathy and despair, technology (virtual) over human life (real), definition of humanity (anthropological, psychological, sociological, or something else) and other ideas to support the notion of “abandoning the flesh.” This all makes it a series only for the brave few.\\n\\nStructure - 2/2 (NO FILLERS &amp; BREAKS!)\\nEverything is almost divided equally in layers and the opening and ending sequences with a key concept related to Lain, the Wired, the organization and Eiri Masami, or the content. There is not a single second of filler as it gets straight to the point since the first viewing of the opening.\\nEverything is relevant to the plot, character, atmosphere, schizophrenic experience, or just the mindscrew. At first glance, they are disjointed or fragmented but do follow a linear timeline shown in different perspectives through the characters and the medium for communication. \\nThink of it as a spiral Mandelbrot set with the last episode as its center/core/tip. To which point the series begins is for the viewer to decide.\\n\\nSince the information is transferred from layer to another, the viewer must have understood the meaning and relevance of every single scene and the importance of the introduced concept or idea to the overall story.\\n\\nPacing – 1.75/2 \\nIt moves along with Lain Iwakura’s involvement in the Real and the Wired.\\nThe episode pacing is slow enough to give the viewer enough time to ponder the philosophical questions asked and interpret the slight changes in the current frame/s while unnecessary events are skipped and hints were shown sparingly to move on to the next concept and keep the viewer interested. On an episode basis, the pacing is slow or realistically paced but, when examining the entire picture, it is quite fast and can leave you puzzled for the entire duration. The first six episodes are consistent, down to the last second of the ending theme, but the next seven lost its screws and started the mindscrew and WTF!? moments (if the first episode was only slightly/partially confusing).  I admit that this second half is hectic to the point of deducting this section a bit but the execution does deliver everything extremely well. \\n\\nConcluding Arc – 2/2 (Sensible only if you survived the mindscrew)\\nConsistent with the memory motif that was mentioned and applied in plot developments and twists, the bittersweet ending is perfectly fitting and foreshadowed a few times. Every loose end is tied up if all of dots are connected.\\n\\nCHARACTER SECTION – 8.25/10\\nLAIN – 2.75/3\\nOmnipresent in both the Real and Wired, this being is represented ... well, anything you can think of. In this series alone, it is shown in the form of a Lain Iwakura, a shy, naive, curious, and “ordinary” junior high school girl with two main conflicting personalities, and Lain of the Wired. Her introverted and socially challenged outer layer is meant to relate to the audience and criticize the hikikomori, NEET, otaku, obsessed Internet users, etc. who have abandoned the “real” world to some extent while her repressed inner self asserts her beliefs in the presence of agents, apathetic classmates and family, conspiracists, trollers, and strangers, states her own opinion in straightforward and honest manner, thinks logically, and does her own way. Freudian and Jungian psychology are applied in the usage and blending of these two personalities as she further engages the people around her and translate herself into the Wired. \\n\\nThe only minor problems for her characterization are her naivety, ideas that rarely come out of nowhere, and confusing personality switch which is rarely done for plot convenience.\\n\\nThe rest – 2/3\\nAll of the characters represent the “normal” citizens of modern society that are purposely designed to be realistic but unlikeable with the selfishness, betrayal, lies, fear, depression, mental breakdown, and death in various ways.  Existing only to contribute to the plot and fully develop Lain Iwakura,  not all of characters have enough screen time and depth. In a way, they are perfect as this allows the audience to focus mostly on the story, the best aspect of the show.\\n\\nDevelopment – 1.5/2 \\nAtypical for the plot and character are integrated. Both advance at the same pace. Unlike most series where there has to be some sort of obvious conflict, the main protagonist simply levels up by interacting with strangers, going to different places, obtaining new friends, gaining new information, and other normal stuff most of humans do. Each information introduced in the episode adds another layer to her characterization. Gradually, her multiple personalities blend, and access in the Wired improves. What is still unclear in the end is how she manages to switch her personality.\\n\\nThe rest do change but only for the sake of the current demands of the story. \\n \\nCatharsis: 2/2\\nSince the characters are never given the same amount of focus on Lain Iwakura, they might as well be dealt with in style. Suicide, insanity, mindscrew, murder/homicide, memory loss, removed from existence, disappearance, abandonment, etc.; everything is there in its uncensored glory. Most are not spared, not even Lain Iwakura. This is not like the Matrix, Black Lagoon, or any other show that just wastes its NPCs or side characters for the sake of plot convenience. Every concluding point of the character’s lives/existence is with reason and can be explained by previous events. \\n\\nART SECTION – 8.5/10 \\nGeneral Artwork and Visuals - 5.25/6\\nProduction values are lower than Ghost in the Shell (1995) and Akira (1989). \\nStock footage is sometimes used. Passable CGI and real photographs don’t blend well with the actual animated artwork.Common animation flaws in the 90s are probably present here. I can nitpick every single flaw there is but resistence is futile against the experimental art style from a late 90s Japanese anime TV series.\\n\\nThe minimalistic artwork and visuals is filled with so much symbolism in most of the frames that the story can never be fully understood without it. Simple color changes, stock footage, and even just the text (e.g. lain in the OP) has some hidden meanings. High contrasts, striking lighting effects, dark color palette that gives off a melancholic feel, bright watercolors, different animation styles, varying detail of background and foregrounds, screen caps, and smooth lines are good enough just on the aesthetic value. What is more impressive is the entire artwork of its computer hardware and software. Monitors, processors, motherboards, wires, cooling systems, etc. are accurately drawn with detail while the programs used are quite similar to the real ones we have. \\n\\nCharacter Figures/Designs -1.75/2 \\nDesigned by the talented Yoshitoshi Abe (Haibane Renmei, Texhnolyze, Niea_7), every character looks exactly as one should be, even the NPCs and avatars. None look like blobs, sticks, or other characters in the show; none have weird hairstyles, and faces and reactions (if you exclude the hallucinations and the mindscrew); all are drawn realistically but never distracting. Detailing, shading, and clothing also change depending on the occasion and complement the physicality and personality of the characters. \\n\\nAs for Lain Iwakura, her unique hairstyle, eyes, and bear clothing (e.g. pajamas (my profile picture), hats, and toy) symbolize something and improve her moe and nymph aspects. \\n\\nThere are couple of inconsistencies in some frames due to angling.\\nSome NPCs lack faces and overall detailing but they are meant to be generic just like the backgrounds so one can focus on the story, the main thing anyone should care about. \\n\\nTransition/Fluidity - 1.5/2\\nAccurate positioning/angling and zooming or scrolling of still frames, along with slow movement, is repeatedly used to compliment its content and artwork. Transition between stock and new footage is handled well especially with the change in audio. This, along with artwork mentioned above, produced the atypical OP and simple ED, each perfect in its own right. \\n\\nAs for actual character movement and special effects, it is paced similarly with the atmosphere but is a bit slow at times. There were key moments when characters should actually be moving instead of the frame only. Certain scenes can be presented on a larger scale so we can see more of just everything from characters to backgrounds without sacrificing the story and the focus on Lain.\\n\\nSOUND SECTION – 9.25/10\\nSoundtrack – 3.75/4 \\nThe opening theme “Duvet” by Boa and the ending theme “Tooi Sakebi” (A Distant Cry) by Nakaido “Chabo” Reichi are excellent choices for they achieve the following:\\n1.) allow Lain Iwakura to communicate her feelings to the audience (personal pronouns are commonly used)\\n2.) perfectly describe her situation in her empty “Real” and dark “Wired” lives.\\n3.) introduce the right atmosphere for entering and exiting the world of LAIN\\nBoth are also in sync with their respective videos.\\n \\nThe OST composed by Reichi “Chabo” Nakaido is a well-crafted collection of unconventional rock, jazz, and techno music. With the exception of Track 10, there are no lyrics but have the same impact, if not more. \\nKodoku No Shigunaru (Signal of Solitude) and Inner Vision give a pleasant and relaxing feeling to mark the end of Lain and our journey in this mess. No other BGMs can match them on the same scenes.\\nCyberia (nightclub) Theme, Lain’s Theme (Yes, she has her own special music theme), and Kiri no Ijigen supply the seriousness and suspense while complementing the content and atmosphere.\\n\\nWhat made this short of a masterpiece is the lack of variety of similar tunes.\\nThe staff played certain BGMs, specifically Kiri no Ijigen, a couple of times when the artwork and dialogue require something more or less “weird”.\\nThe result is a conflict of the emotions previously and currently invoked.\\nWOW! or WTF!? responses for every episode happens less often. Also, there are a few moments when the BGM is played at the wrong time or does not give off the right tone.\\n\\nBy itself, the soundtrack is perfect, but, when used in the anime, it is not. \\nThe second soundtrack “Cyberia Mix” makes up for flaws of the first.  \\n\\nBGM/SFX – 3/3\\nThe silence and buzzing sounds of cables sounds helps the audience focus on the finer details and important concepts presented in the artwork while the sparingly used creepy or rock tunes and sound effects change the tone to spice things up when necessary. Never was it ever distracting the audience from the current topic and always gave a sense of realism or just weirdness. \\nWhatever you hear in a room, sidewalks, buildings, vehicle, computer, etc. in our current world, Earth, sounds extremely similar in this show. It tried to be as real as possible and succeeded. \\n \\nVoice Acting – 2.5/3\\nGnerally good for the seiyuu.\\nThe voice actors may lack the emotional touch in their dialogues and sound dull, boring, wooden, or awkward but they manage to maintain the more important ambiance. Lain's voice actor is commendable though.\\n\\nAs for the English and modified voices, the computer software does it exceptionally and beats everything else, including the modern Vocaloids (e.g. Hatsune Miku).\\n\\nVALUE SECTION - 10/10 (PRESENT DAY, PRESENT TIME!)\\nHistorical Value and Memorability - 7/7\\nAlong with Ghost in the Shell (1995), these are the only prominent cyberpunk titles in the 90s that have significant influence in the treatment of anime and rebirth of the genre itself. \\n\\nThis is one of the few titles ever made to have only one multi-layered female protagonist that ultimately defined the entire series and be remembered for who knows how long. \\n\\nLastly, the bear clothing fetish was reintroduced in the anime community.\\n\\nReplayability - 3/3 \\nDecrypting everything will take the same time as memorizing and implementing all of the right combinations in Dragon Lair from scratch without cheating. The clues are all over the place and it might take days, months, or years and every rewatch can give a different overall understanding of the mystery behind LAIN and the Wired. \\n\\nENJOYMENT SECTION – 10/10 (And you don’t seem to understand...)\\nHaving none of the MOE, unnecessary fanservice and violence, storyTELLING, forced and cliché plot devices, overused formulas, bad pacing, and the damned FILLERS  and recaps (but I admit that some are enjoyable), one experiences something nonexistent in the majority of all anime titles.\\n\\nIt is a coming of age experience that treats its audience as independent critical thinkers and mature adults. Never does it attempt to manipulate our emotions, caterto  specific fetishes, tell the story, waste time, censor controversial images, sugarcoat the content, and any of the like. Instead, it offers the questions , that fuel the human insatiable curiosity, and pure mindscrew by simply overloading the human brain with the constant stream of information about the mysteries, hallucinations, and philosophical notions. One doesn't need to see themselves in the characters like in Neon Genesis Evangelion and  Revolutionary Girl Utena or have eyegasms with the animation in the movie versions of the two mentioned titles above. All one needs is to focus on the story and whatever happens to the main character and the rest will follow. Everything is consistent, neutral, and honest for what it is – avant-garde.\\n\\nOVERALL OBJECTIVE RATING – 9.29/10\\nA truly deserving cult classic that still stands to the tests of time by 2011 standards. \\n\\nNow, watch the AMV (what should be the official trailer) in the given link below:\\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaFayr9zI-8t\\n\\nSuggestion List:\\nNeon Genesis Evangelion series (popularized the mindscrew/dementia genre)\\nRevolutionary Girl Utena (deconstruction of the shoujo genre while mindfucking its target audience)\\nHaibane Renmei (Lain for the casuals)\\nTexhnolyze (same difficulty, shares some similarities with SELain and NGE)\\nBoogiepop Phantom (same theme of escapism)\\nFLCL (easier than all of the above, can be watched by simply chillaxing)\",\n",

Gintama fans have to stop fleeing reality. This is the second season of Gintama, so you'll be watching this after 201 episodes of S1. I'll get right into it, no need to explain the world of this anime. In a seemingly normal episode, in that it's so crazy, Gintoki, after getting himself completely drunk, and forgetting what happened the night before, believes to have slept with 5 girls : otae, sarutobi, tsukuyo, kyubi, otose, and as if thatdidn't seem much, with hasegawa too(a midle aged man). everything makes him believe that he did sleep with them, as they make him take responsability. \\nSo the episode unfolds, it's as over the top as ever, it's very funny haha, but at the same time it makes you wonder : will character development and relationships change in the future ? well no : again, the funny haha : it turns out they all did this to make gintoki understand he shouldn't drink too much, as he had wrecked the bar they drank too.\\n\\nso it ends, relationships stay the same, the very funny.\\n\\nbut do they?\\n\\nthe thing is... at the end of the episode...\\nplayed like a joke...\\nHasegawa...\\nreveals he wasn't part of the plan.\\n\\nYes. You heard me. He wasn't part of the part of the plan to make gintoki believe he slept with him to make him understand he shouldn't drink too much.\\nYou understand what I mean. You remember your sealed memories. Chaos unfolds into your mind as I call you back to reality.\\nBut you won't overcome your traumas by rejecting them.\\nGintoki did have a sexual relationship with hasegawa.\\nthis relationship, a very important one, isn't touched upon later in the series.\\nbut this is how it is. \\nas important as this relevation may seem : meaning that the show will never be the same, it won't be the funny haha joke, but the very serious hoho, there's also the fact that Gintoki rejects having slept with Hasegawa. Though it's said by hattori he had a smile after spending 20 minutes alone with Hasegawa the former night. \\n\\nyes. That's the final important revelation I have for you. Gintoki is Homosexual, and he rejects it. \\n\\nwether you want to ignore this as most fans, or accept it and move on : it's a very important thing that you should take into account as you go into Gintama S2 and onward.\",\n",

       "  \"Having watched this right before I'we written this review, I didn't know what to expect. Then the first frames came in. Whoa! WHOA! OH MY JESUS! This is it! This is how you make cell animation in 2008! I can tell ya, NOTHING EVER was this beautifully drawn before! I don't think I was even breathing during the second story! It easily puts every other cell animated title to shame(ONLY in terms of animation), and will be the only thing for YEARS to come that will deserve a perfect score. For how it is drawn, naturally. For in every other aspect, 5 Centimetres per second is a mixed bag. Wehave one story going back and forth on the line from stupid to beautiful. One that is exactly how the entire feature should have been, and one that's just plain moronic. But let's go with the airing order, shall we?\\n\\nThe first story: I don't really know. Sure, it's anice little topic, lovers seperated and all, but it seems as if common sense would be cast aside for drama. How is it, that in the present day, two people who are in love with each other but seperated still communicate by mail? Why does it take a train trip to get the idea of using the telephone to keep in touch? Why does the story give us the illusion that the meeting itself solved anything when later on it disproves itself? Sure enough, the train trip felt agonizing at times (a HUGE plus), but it was just a bit too melodramatic. So like I said, I can't really put it anywhere.\\n\\nThe second story: HELL YEAH! Now this is romance! I don't know how the show manages to make the viewer forget that the imagery plays a huge part in conveying the overall tone, but it does, and you just sit back, and enjoy a rendition of a girls emotions that is so beutiful, and most importantly, so REAL(unlike 90% of everything else in this regard), you instantly forgive life for failures like Tokikaku. This story has a heart, this story has a soul, this story is so much better then the other two, you would have to think it was written by a completely different person! The best of the bunch, hands down!\\n\\nAnd so, we arrived at story three, the train to real life will leave from here in ten minutes, we apologize for the inconvenience.\\n\\nEver been on a roller coaster? Harken back to the time when you were on it first, the mesmerizing felling of climbing ever higher and higher, until the point where you reach the top, and suddenly, you realise that you don't really want to go down, but you will anyway, and besides, it's the only way to get back on the ground. Not to mention that you can't do anything about it. Now imagine that suddenly, while you are at the top, the roller coaster crumbles undernath you, and you plummet to your doom at terminal velocity until you stop sixteen feet under ground leaving a crater big enough to fit the entire roller coaster in. This is as close as you will come to the experience that is the third story, something for wich the person who gave the green light for it's enclusion should have his/her lungs exposed to ridiculus amounts of Zyklon B. It tryes, and HOW it tryes to give a fitting aftermath to the first story, but the degree it fails at this makes you question the sanity of the mind that ever thought of it's creation, let alone inclusion! It haphazardly introduces new characters for no known reason, and succeeds in making (at least) the main character look like a totally unrelatable, ununderstandable retard by not only having him NOT living in contact with his girl, but rather getting a new one, WHITOUT SEPERATING HIMSELF FROM THE FIRST ONE, AND BEING ANXIOUS ABOUT IT! Basically any bit of common sense that was gathered for these characters in the first story goes out the window so fast, you wonder why there was any reason giving them any in the first place. Plus, it doesn't solve anything! It's Bullshit with a capital B (no, better, a backwards b, a d), and ultimately pulls the production down into mediocre junk territory for making everyone believe that the characters of the first and third story are the real focus of the story, completely overshadowing the brilliant second one. (Thankfully, it's barely ten minutes long, so it can't detract from the value of it's prettyness and it's middle.)\\n\\nOh, and if you are going to have a male solo artist singing the end theme of your show, make sure you get one that doesn't sound like me when drunk and trying to parody sing(this goes double for L'arc en ciel).\\n\\nNo wait, Japan doesn't have any of those.\",\n",

       "  \"That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime was great. It was a show that brought me back to the isekai train after watching a certain broken heap of an isekai anime from the Summer 18 season that shall not be mentioned. The story was fun and nicely written. The characters were fun and enjoyable especially Rimuru. The visuals were beautiful and the music, as well as voice acting for both languages, were great. It's was the best isekai anime that I watched despite its few faults. Naturally, I decided to check out Shield Hero as I thought it would be the next best iskeai anime thatwill surpass Slime based on the amazing premise. It had the potential to be the saviour of this tiresome and uninspired genre. Maybe that was my mistake and I expecting too much for an isekai anime at this point.\\nSo what exactly went wrong here?\\nThe story, characters, themes, world-building, direction all of the above?\\n\\nIn order to not immediately begin destroying this contrived mess of a plot, I'll start talking about what I liked and that is the revenge aspect of Shield Hero.\\nOne of the main things that made Shield Hero stand out of the isekai crowd is that it was the first true dark isekai anime. You could say that Re:Zero was the first true dark isekai anime however it only had one episode that was truly dark while the rest the show is tamed in comparison.\\n\\nFrom start to finish as we follow a broken and damaged lead trying to save the world while trying to endure and fight the endless hatred caused by the people he was summoned.\\nThis alone really made Shield Hero unique in the story side of things as it ditches most of the story elements that were in other isekai anime in order to introduce new story elements that were not presented in other isekai anime until now with Shield Hero.\\n\\nShield Hero is a core revenge story.\\n\\nThe revenge story may not be as special when it comes to anime but Shield Hero is one of the most fascinating and rewarding revenge stories I have seen in the long while. While it may not be as well written like Skip Beat and Gankustou it was still a fascinating ride I really enjoyed.\\nSeeing Naofumi humiliating and take down the people that caused his reputation to get shattered put a smile on my face as he really went through a lot of things in order to have the will to take them down. This is all thanks to the show's fairly competent writing when it's not being an incompetent pandering feast and that is where our problems begin.\\n\\nWhile the revenge aspect of the show was strong from start to finish, I cannot say the same thing for the other story elements such as the save the world from the waves. The waves are basically your typical survival arenas that you see in a video game and they are not that interested in the slightest thanks to weak execution.\\n\\nI will give the show credit for trying to make the waves interesting toward the end but by then the show was already over by that point.\\nAnother major problem that would later plague the anime is how they make everyone minus the protagonist dumb and contrived. This alone really takes a massive shit of Naofumi's revenge tale as it could have been avoided if the characters just shut up and behave like actual human beings.\\n\\nFurthermore, why did no one in the capital cast a lie detector spell on both Naofumi and Malty chest? Any person with a brain would have put a lie detector spell on someone in case they are lying where they could receive a shock. The fact that the series showcased that the slave crest can also detect lies in episode 21 was infuriating and it really highlights just how contrived and poorly written the series is as it could have been used in episode 1 for Naofumi's trial.\\n\\nDon't get me started with the lacklustre world-building. I will give it Shield Hero credit for least trying to establish it's own world in certain episodes it compared to most other isekai animes but it's still lacklustre as the world at various points feels so lifeless and empty.\\nThe UI system is not interesting in the slightest as just another generic UI system that has been done in other isekai anime in the past.\\nNow Shield Hero has a lot of themes yet most of them were poorly executed. My favourite is how the show tackles the topic of slavery. Not only is it handed incredibly poorly due to how preachy it was but the topic of slavery more often gets shafted (especially in the second half) in favour of stupid pandering.\\n\\nBy far the biggest problem with Shield Hero is that it doesn't truly know what it wants to be.\\nAt first, the show is a dark revenge story, then it's a power fantasy and then it's an adventure series, then it's a harem. This alone really screws up the tone, direction and pacing of the series.\\nThe first 4 episodes of Shield Hero is very grim and dark that has a lot of tension and atmosphere thanks to the subject matter of rape and humiliation. Naofumi is portrayed as a cold lead who just wanted to revenge of the people that humiliated him. Unfortunately, episodes 5 and onward the series decided, for the most part, put its revenge plot in the bus just so the series can add generic isekai tropes and cliches for a show that didn't need it in the first place.\\n\\nIt's not like the revenge has been shafted the revenge aspect it's but it doesn't appear all the much post-episode 5 as the series decides to waste its time of sick self insert loli pandering.\\n\\nFinally, the final 4 episodes which were without a question one of the most boring and lacklustre final 4 episodes I have seen in 2019\\nNot only did the series completely jump the shark where it introduced plot threads up its ass but it also lost its purpose.\\n\\nEpisode 21 in terms of atmosphere and direction feels like I'm watching a finale of anime and it really shows. The episode after that feels like episode fodder as it's filled with fan-service and plot threads that won't be fleshed out due to the low episode count. I give the final 4 episodes credit for showcasing Naofumi's new powers and abilities then again the show could have ended with a cliffhanger after episode 21/22\\n\\nThe final thing I want to point out is the controversy in the first episode. When Shield Hero first aired it was met with controversy thanks to its offensive content where Malty (aka Bitch) falsely accused Nafoumi of raping her. I can definitely get why people get mad of this messy storytelling as it was done much better in Persona 5 but what I cannot forgive is a bunch of SJW try-hards trying to put down a show just because it deals with more serious themes and topics.\\nThis is why I didn't give two shits about the Goblin Slayer controversy as that series was an awful show regardless of the controversy being there or not.\\n\\nThe characters aren't much better as all of them minus Nafoumi and Raphtalia ranged from bland, annoying, poorly written or the combination of the three.\\nLet's start with Nafoumi who is easily the best thing about Shield Hero.\\nHe starts off as a grumpy individual who doesn't trust people but as the series progresses with the aid of Raphtalia not only does he open up to people he also becomes a proper badass especially towards the final quarter of the series.\\n\\nAnother strong aspect of Naofumi is that he's not overpowered as he mostly relies on his partners to take down various enemies. Finally, he is not a bore to watch, which more I can say about iskeai protagonist as they all lifelessly self-insert husks.\\nNafoumi is tied with Rimuru for being my favourite isekai protagonist.\\nAnother character that I really liked is Raphtalia. She may not be as good as Naofumi in terms of development but she's a good character in her own right.\\nI liked her chemistry towards Naofumi. Despite being a loli she will do anything to project Naofumi from falling into darkness.\\n\\nSadly this is where my praise for the characters ends. The show has a lot of characters yet all of them are clichéd and poorly written to the core.\\n\\nThe other heroes are a bunch of soulless character archetypes. They don't develop as characters whatsoever and they are all incredibly contrived. The bottom dog of the bunch a spear hero who is one of the most contrived and dumbest characters I have seen. His dialogue is painful to listen as he incredibly preachy for the sake of it and he's the main source of the show's major contrivances. In many ways, he's no different Sugou from Sword Art Online thanks to comically evil appearance and dialogue.\\nFinally, the less I say about his confrontation towards the Shield Hero the better. The same thing can be said for Malty and Filo as they are literally loli trophies that constantly suck of Naofumi hairy crotch for a living.\\nThe villains are garbage. They are all evil for the sake of being evil, especially Malty who is probably the worst female villain I have ever seen in any fictional work. Her motivations are contrived beyond belief and she's overall a slag.\\nShe's comically evil and not even treating in the least. Her contrived motives aren't explained or given any depth whatsoever.\\nOur villain's ladies and gentlemen.\\n\\nAs for the overall presentation, Shield Hero looks beautiful for the most part. It may not be as colourful as 8bit That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime but it still has that special visual flair that helped it stand out from the crowd of other isekai anime. Character designs for the part were appealing to look at. The background scenery has a lot of attention that is only made better by the use of dark soft colour palette.\\n\\nThe animation is, for the most part, good and fluent. The fight choreography is solid, the movement is smooth and there's rarely any recycled footage.\\n\\nUnfortunately, Shield Hero visually is not perfect for one. The animation does dip a bit for certain episodes as it messes up the overall good fight choreography of the series. The second and final notable issue was the crappy use of CGI as it was not only ugly to look at it but also didn't blend in with the 2D animation.\\n\\nNow we have the soundtrack and it's shocking subpar. The series features a dull score of fantasy music that doesn't keep the viewer invested in the scene due to how bland they were.\\n\\nSure there were a couple of decent tracks every now and then, but it wasn't enough to save this mediocre soundtrack.\\n\\nThe first opening theme Rise by MADKID is a fantastic opening that not only fits the tone of the series, it also a generally well-produced song that is filled with great vocals that scream hype.\\nThe same cannot be said for the second opening theme FAITH by MADKID. It's still a good opening on its own right but it was missing the intensity that was from the first opening.\\nI may be the minority when I say this, but I really dislike the ending themes. Everything about them screams generic and lazy with their boring vocals and mediocre ending visuals.\\nThe voice acting is great for both languages. The voice actors for both the dub and sub did a fantastic job with the roles that they were given. Notable performances go to Kaito Ishikawa as Nafoumi (sub), Billy Kametz as Nafoumi (dub), Erica Mendez as Raphtalia (dub) and Rina Hidaka as Filo (sub).\\n\\nIt's honestly sad what happened here. Shield Hero had to be great but it totally blew it.\\nIt has underwhelming characterisation, a shitty executed plot that is only made worse by plot contrivances and a subpar soundtrack.\\nThe only thing that saved this show from being terrible is the visuals and the main two characters. Everything else was a mess.\\n\\nI honestly thoughtt that Shield Hero and Slime would save the isekai genre for me but I guess Shield Hero was not suitable for the job as it showed its true colours which is being another generic isekai anime.\\n\\nI hope season 2 and beyond will be better.\\n\\nLeast you tried Shieldbro.\",\n",
       "  '\"I\\'m curious,\" says Chitanda Eru, and Oreki Houtarou, unable to resist the sparkle in her eyes, knows that once more he has to give up on his lazy ways to help her solve a new everyday mystery. Hyouka is a series that takes elements of both the mystery and school life genres, mixes them together, and churns out a product that is a very interesting blend of the two. At heart it is very much what you\\'d expect from a school comedy, from the cast to the plot. The cynical, dry male lead with a sarcastc streak to his inner thoughts and narrating, the airheaded somehow-top-of-her-classfemale lead with more energy than a hamster on coffeine, the male lead\\'s goofy, easygoing guy friend, and so on. Episodes centering around onsen visits, pool days and cultural festivals, a carefree after-school life in a club that does relatively little, and so on. The cliches and stereotypes line up, but what it presents isn\\'t as bad as the premise makes it out to be, in part because the characters carry something more than just their stereotype. Especially in Mayaka\\'s story arc there\\'s very interesting characterization, and the love stories that are presented don\\'t feel forced or out of place, being subtly sweet rather than diabetic.\\n\\nThe most significant reason for the decent presentation lies in its crossover with the mystery genre however, and the way it handles this. Essentially what the main characters spend their time doing is solving everyday mysteries, be that a strangely locked door, mysterious disappearances of school property, or other such events. The main character, Oreki Houtarou, while strangely devoid of any other noteworthy talents, has an uncanny knack for piecing together bits and pieces of information and form a theory on the passing of events - indeed, he is the kind of detective you see in the classics of crime, only instead of crimes and murders he solves minor mysteries of daily life.\\n\\nThe sequence of events and the way hints to the mystery\\'s solution are presented is done rather well, and while some can be missed easily, or relies on understanding aspects of Japanese language and culture, upon properly watching through episodes after a mystery\\'s solution, most if not all the clues used to piece the mystery together are clearly there for the viewer to see, and pieced together the finished conclusion seems coherent and logical.\\n\\nVisually the mystery solving is aided by creative visualizations of the characters\\' trains of thought, helping the viewer to understand and comprehend what is being reasoned more easily. This is a very good decision by the creators, because if there were only spoken words some of the explanations could easily go over the heads of the viewers, but with the visual element, it\\'s very easy to comprehend. \\n\\nEven putting that aside the art remains very lovely, using a vivid colour palette, which together with lush background, clear lighting effects and camera angles that are not often seen in anime series gives the series a very liely and engaging visual appeal, as should be expected of a school series, plus plus. The music is likewise very appropriate for a mystery series, with suspenseful and sometimes dramatic instrumentation and dynamics, yet it does not forgo some of the more typical tracks of school anime, from the exciting tunes of fun days to the goofy tunes of funny scenes. Of particular note is that it also uses a few pieces of classic music as \\n\\nThe opening themes are both decent, lively j-pop tunes, a little upbeat but nothing quite over the top. Thematically they draw on some central aspects of the main character\\'s leading issue of him feeling a little gray and distanced from his friends and the \\'normal\\', lively high school life, with some lovely colour and effect use mixed amidst the more standard anime opening clips. The first ending theme is a more bright, sung-by-the-female-leads pop song, while the animation is ninety percent silly fanservice. The second ending song is a very upbeat pop song that sort of screams \"school anime ending theme\", with bright backgrounds and the like, though it does an amusing job making references to older detective fiction.\\n\\nOverall Hyouka is a decent series that brings something new and refreshing to the school anime genre, and while it doesn\\'t point itself out as a very good anime, falls to a few stereotypes and so forth, it does stand out above the massive crowd of school anime that are less successful in their attempts to break away from the masses. It offers lovely visuals and music and does a very good job at visually presenting the characters\\' thoughts in a orderly but also fun fashion, and it\\'s fun seeing the mysteries get solved. If you\\'re a fan of either genre this series will probably offer you something interesting, without being particularly outstanding.',\n",

       "  'There’s a particular kind of frustration associated with a show like The Quintessential Quintuplets, the kind of frustration resulting from recognizing a show that’s so painfully close to being good you can almost taste it. And not just good, but good in a way that doesn’t usually work for you, good in terms of a genre that has almost never connected with you, good in a way that could serve as proof positive for the potential of an entire style of storytelling to finally work its magic on you and overcome your ingrained distaste for where it’s coming from. As someone who has overall enjoyedmaybe one traditional harem anime in his life (Zero no Tsukaima, before it all went to shit), the sensation of finding myself getting sucked into The Quints was so unexpected and refreshing that I found myself wanting to overlook all its obvious flaws and just let myself enjoy it. Sadly, while the core itself is solid, there are just too many little things that don’t work over the course of its run, too many frustrating distractions for me to consider it a worthwhile investment. But we almost made it, lads. We almost had another harem anime that spoke to me. If nothing else, I can’t help but find a little hope in that.\\n\\nAt any rate, the plot follows the typical harem formula of one dude surrounded by a bunch of female fetish archetypes who all start to fall for him, though the specifics of how it’s implemented this time around are unique enough to warrant interest. Futaro Uesugi is an A+ honors student from a poor family, desperately trying to keep his grades up in order to go to a good college and provide for his father and adorable little sister (don’t worry, she’s explicitly not part of the harem this time). But a chance encounter provides him an unexpected opportunity to earn some much-needed cash: by tutoring, as the name suggests, a set of quintuplet sisters from a rich family who all have their unique talents and skills, but are academically dumb as a bag of rocks. Futaro’s the kind of grump who would much rather study on his own than be forced into human interaction, but the appeal of a high salary is too much for him, so he sets about trying to tutor these five girls and bump their grades up to acceptable levels. Very soon, the realization sets in that if he’s going to overcome their distaste of studying in general and him in particular, he’s going to have to help them through their various emotional hang-ups, many of which relate to the complicated nature of being one fifth of such a massive family unit. Thus, the stage is set for butting heads and romantic tension aplenty, as Futaro and the girls slowly open up to each other over time.\\n\\nSo like I said, it’s a fairly typical harem set up on the surface, and you’d be forgiven for thinking it had little to set it apart from the general low quality of such shows. And yet, while it does stumble into plenty of the cliches you’d expect- accidental groping, walking into someone else naked because nobody locks their damn door- the foundational writing at the core of the thing is shockingly solid. All these characters actually feel like characters, as opposed to stock archetypes, with enough well-defined motivations and hang-ups to justify the ridiculous situations they often find themselves in. Miku, the shy one, is also a massive history buff with a far keener perception than first glance would let on. Ichika, technically the eldest of the five, has a surprisingly complex outlook on her sisters’ complicated relationship. Futaro himself is enough of an acerbic wit to counterbalance the usual harem problem of the guy being a completely uninteresting pile of mush; he can easily stand toe to toe with his love interests, comedically and dramatically. And there’s a genuine reality to all their interactions, a sense that the loss of any one of them would fundamentally change the way the show operates. That’s the mark of a good ensemble cast; everyone, even the initially-hard-to-stomach abrasive tsundere, feels essential. It’s a dynamic that you want to get invested in, because it’s well-realized enough to warrant that level of investment.\\n\\nSadly, as much as I wanted to like The Quints for its smart handling of the harem formula, it’s let down by a production that is, quite frankly, amateurish as hell. Time was clearly poorly allocated over the course of pulling this show together, because the animation starts getting janky by the second episode and never really recovers. Left on their own, the character designs of all the girls are all pretty attractive, but in motion, they all feel stiff and lifeless, bereft of personality that the VAs try admirably to cover for with their expressive performances. And look, I can handle a little less-than-perfect animation if it comes to that, but the way this show is so haphazardly slapped together ends up killing the pacing and driving a wedge through a good chunk of the otherwise very strong comedy. Jokes can’t land with their intended force if the animation is awkwardly flailing to catch up to the punch line and highlighting just how unmatched these rough cuts are to this vibrant, bouncy tonal sensibility. It creates a distracting layer of unreality about the world; the way scenes flow and move into each other feels stilted and discordant in a way that makes the actions of the characters feel not grounded in the reality of their situation. The writing goes to such lengths to make them feel like sensible, understandable characters, but the awkwardness of the production makes them feel like aliens with no comprehension of how to react to any situation normally.\\n\\nThere’s also some weird business about how since they’re quintuplets, the girls are all supposedly impossible to tell apart when they pretend to be each other, a concept mined for both comedy and emotional weight, yet the character designer gave them all such distinct hair colors that you’d have to be an idiot not to recognize them as themselves. And that leads to bizarre moments where Futaro will mistake a girl for one of his sisters, despite the audience clearly being able to tell by her hair color who it truly is, yet the show still treats it as a shocking reveal when Futaro realizes that fact for himself. I have no idea if the obvious unbelievability of this nonsense was supposed to be the point of the joke, like it’s supposed to be funny that Futaro keeps confusing them for each other despite them being very distinct. There’s one particular scene where all five of them have to sneak by an authority figure by dressing up and pretending to be the same quintuplet, and the parade of different hair colors doing nothing to tip him off is so bizarrely goofy that I can’t help but feel like that was the intended effect. But other times, it feels like we’re supposed to be genuinely surprised upon finding out someone’s true identity, and I have no idea why. Did someone in the production team genuinely think we couldn’t tell hair colors apart? Because if not, it’s a baffingly idiotic decision, emblematic of the carelessness of the entire damn production. It’s an inescapable, constant flaw that drags the entire show down, burying its strengths in a much of incomprehensible presentation.\\n\\nAnd yet. And yet, I still really want to hold out hope for The Quintessential Quintuplets. The fact that it was able to connect with me at all, when I so rarely find any value in the harem genre, speaks volumes to the level of effort that went into it. This wasn’t some half-assed story someone slapped together for a quick buck; there was care and effort put into it. And had the production been able to match it, we may have genuinely had a new harem classic on our hands. Perhaps if it gets picked up for a second season, Tezuka Productions can finally give it the time and attention it deserves. But until then, I’m just left wishing that this obvious gem was delivered clean of unnecessary, muddying tarnish.',\n",

I really liked the story (9/10) because of two things. One, time travel is a theme that is hard to nail. There are films that do horribly because they do nothing to explain it. There are films that receive mixed reviews because they over-explain it (Interstellar). And then there are films that don\\'t overload you withthe science while including a basic explanation to allow the story to flow. Do I 100% understand how the letters were sent back? Of course not, because no one does. However, I think Orange explained their version of time travel well enough to not have viewers nitpick at it. They elaborated enough so that it doesn\\'t have to be the main emphasis of the anime. Actually this transitions really well into my second point. The main emphasis of Orange is actually not on the concept of time travel (*what really? I didn\\'t know that...*) but rather on the selflessness of friends and what friends will do to continue being friends. MC Naho receives a letter from the future and tries to save her friend and crush\\'s life. How selfless can you get? I understand that some of her actions were pretty stupid, but then again, this is a school slice of life anime. Everybody makes mistakes, everybody has those days. But how Orange wove in the events in the letters and how they changed in the present was so masterfully done that I had to rate the story a 9.\\n\\nThe art of Orange was pretty good (8/10). Made from the same studio as Ao Haru Ride, it\\'s not exactly the type of conventional art style we think of when we hear the word \"anime\", but I think it would\\'ve been a hindrance if it were to be animated in how most of us are used to seeing anime. Orange is a softer anime and the art definitely contributed to that effect.\\n\\nThe soundtrack, by itself, is very good (8/10). I\\'m now listening to Kobukuro thanks to Orange\\'s ending. Mirai (the ending song) has a really soft timbre and provides the feels train with electricity. Whenever I hear those first ascending notes in the ending, I get goosebumps. Hikari no Hahen, the opening song, is pretty much the average for any serious high school show. Guitars, lighthearted vocals, and standard drumming, it just screams \"mainstream slice of life right here!\" Apart from the opening and ending, the sounds in the actual anime aren\\'t bad - they contribute to the scene sometimes, but other times they are just annoying.\\n\\nThe character development is where Orange really takes the W (10/10). First of all, Naho is a social dandere and makes for an annoying MC sometimes, due to her inability to make the right decisions, but it\\'s cute when she gets it right. I mean, you have a letter from the future to tell you what to do right, but she ignores some of it, or even follows it to the letter (heh) and that just ticks me off sometimes. Kakeru is a solid character - he blames himself for his mother\\'s death and near the end, shuts himself out from his friends thinking that he\\'s hurting them. How sweet can you get... I mean, he\\'s the one hurting the most, but he doesn\\'t want to burden others, what a sympathetic character. I can\\'t really say I feel for him since my parents are alive and well, but it\\'s understandable why he acts the way he does. Suwa is a really strong character, both in the physical sense and the emotional sense. He is supportive, and is ready to take on any challenge. He doesn\\'t really change throughout the show, but he\\'s reliable and probably the smartest out of the whole bunch, which is funny considering he\\'s also the jock in the group. He sacrifices his own love life for Naho and Kakeru\\'s. That\\'s called selflessness and taking one for the team. Takako is just Takako, not really an interesting character, she\\'s just there. Now we get interesting. Azusa is the outgoing girl of the group, and she\\'s the one who usually plays matchmaker. Everyone likes her, and if she wasn\\'t in the show, Orange would get bland very quickly. My favourite character, Hagita, is the nerdy and seemingly pessimistic of the bunch. He\\'s quite the tsundere and is portrayed to have a crush on Azusa. Actually, he\\'s married to her in the future. He acts as the comedic relief, often ignored and made fun of, but he has as much of an importance on the story as everyone else. After all, he\\'s the one who broke Kakeru\\'s bike to protect him. He\\'s the best.\\n\\nThe enjoyment factor of Orange was off the charts (10/10). Often, I would go through the weekdays wishing for Sunday to come to watch Orange on Kissanime. If it detracts my attention from my work and captivates me when I\\'m watching, I can\\'t see how it deserves anything less than a 10 for enjoyment.\\n\\nOverall, Orange received a 9 from me, because of its successful characters and plot. For all you reviewers who gave Orange a five or lower, I would *strongly* insist that you reconsider.',\n",

       "  \"Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind is a heartfelt movie, with beautiful, lovingly-crafted animation. It suffers from a few minor flaws, but the positive aspects make those flaws almost completely irrelevant. First, let's talk about the story. The movie not only has some great action-packed moments, and an intricate story, but it's story also has a meaningful theme. It does a great job of setting up the world, and even though it doesn't explore it too much, you get a great a sense of place. Also, even though the setting is fantastical, it still feels grounded in reality, as though this place could exist somewhere.This makes it much more effective and moving when they show scenes that depict the horrors of war... making the story as much about morality as it is about entertainment.\\n\\nThe movie also works as a metaphor working against pollution, yet it gets this across in a subtle way and doesn't feel forced. Unfortunately, I can't say the same about some of the dialogue. At some points, a character will say something that's a bit on-the-nose, making it seem like the writers went out of their way to explain things to the viewer. This gets a bit annoying, but this is only a minor blemish on an otherwise lovingly crafted tale.\\n\\nAs for the characters, for the most part, they're pretty well done. The titular character, Nausicaa, feels memorable enough, going one step above being a generic archetype, and she has a certain amount of depth to her... however, most the supporting cast is a bit more generic, and they don't feel quite as memorable. Still, all of the characters feel realistic, and their reactions to situations all feel natural and appropriate.\\n\\nThe art, as I've said above, is absolutely beautiful. Even though the few rough edges it has makes it's obvious this was made 20 years ago, the art still holds up. Every frame has a ton of love poured into it. Things move smoothly, fluidly, and the presentation of it all makes everything shine. Colors are used incredibly well, and the backgrounds are absolutely breathtaking.\\n\\nThe audio is also generally well done, although parts of it feel dated. I watched the Japanese version, and the voice acting was all very nicely executed. I thought the soundtrack was also great, and helped set the tone for each scene wonderfully. The soundtrack was also pretty catchy, yet it also managed to not get in the way. However, I did think some of the soundtrack felt like it had some futuristic/technological thematic undertones, which seemed a bit out of place in the scenes where the music was used. Also, most of the sound effects were fine, but some of them felt very flat, and, understandably, sounded like they came from foley techniques of the 80's.\\n\\nOverall, the movie was pretty incredible. There's a few rough edges, and a few things I could complain about, but any complaints I had with it essentially ended up being very minor, especially with everything else the movie has to offer. It's a beautiful looking film, with a beautiful story, and one that's easy to recommend to just about anybody.\",\n",

       "  \"One Punch Man features this crazy workout introduced by the main character Saitama. To prevent spoilers, I will not give details of the workout. Anyway, I tried the workout and now have rotator cuff tendonitis. So word of advice. Do not push yourself through his workout, unless you’re physically able. If you decide to watch the anime, watch each episode through to the previews. There’s a short scene after the credits. Now onto the review. Based on the famous webcomic by One (yes, his alias is One), One Punch Man has a simple plot: the protagonist defeating enemies with one hit. He is bored, looking forworthy opponents of being a challenge for him. As a fan of the manga, Madhouse met my expectations as they usually do with adaptations. The pacing was good, as they kept the story going by eliminating the side stories in the manga. It resembled a classic ‘90s superhero show consisting of monsters and heroes with phenomenal sakuga. \\n\\nKeep in mind before investing your time in this show that it is a parody. Do not expect seriousness throughout the 12 episodes. It is a silly gag comic about a superhero who always wins but is very unpopular among the community. If you had bad experiences with parodies, do not disregard One Punch Man. I disliked some parodies like Cromartie High School and had a fun time watching this show. Some parts, including the repetitive punchlines emphasizing on Saitama’s superpower and foolishness, may not appeal to you. There are other comical fragments to look forward to, especially the characters’ dialogue and side jokes. It may not make you laugh, but it is still entertaining and dynamic with its concept. To be quite honest, I can’t imagine getting bored with this show. With that being said, it is easy to misplace your expectations.\\n\\nWhy do some people dislike One Punch Man? I had an opposite experience from those individuals. It is true some people will not find this funny or entertaining at all. I will admit that some jokes are introduced early on and become predictable. No amount of visuals or good animation can amount for that. One Punch Man also presents a general punchline throughout the show, emphasizing Saitama’s superpower, foolishness, and psychological view of the world of superheroes and villains. Admittedly, this may not be the show for you, but I advise making it through at least the first 3-4 episodes. That tends to be the moment when people who are disinterested throw in the towel. \\n\\nFor me, there was more emphasis on comedy in the first half and action in the second half, especially with the arcs halfway through. The dialogue and actions of the characters are hilarious as they are meant as side jokes. The monsters are eliminated, not just by one punch, but from being in the middle of a fight that doesn't involve them. E.g. After inquiring his friend’s condition, a creature was slashed immediately during Saitama and another creature’s fight. It parodies a couple of shounen tropes. The fights do not last long, allowing more enemies with exponentially high levels of power to appear. Based on the ending, One Punch Man successfully parodied the absurdities of the superhero genre. The occurrence was obvious. The ending also reached a crescendo that led me to believe there is more to the story (I’m not up-to-date on the manga). Superhero shows are hardly ever over, so I see a potential second season.\\n\\nThe characters were distinct, but there was not much time for character development in all of the characters. The ending introduced some major flaws in characters’ personalities that must be addressed or furthered. Saitama’s personality and mindset brought ebullience to the story. Sometimes his actions may seem unusual, but it has meaning. The majority of the monsters gave a brief introduction to their life story. Every superhero was distinct in their powers, characteristics, and backstories. I was slightly disappointed in terms of the heroes. I wanted to see the powers of all the superheroes. There was an obese superhero stuffing his face with burgers, and I wonder what could he possibly accomplish. At first, it seemed like Saitama is the only superhero saving the day, but other heroes finally had their chances, too.\\n\\n“THE HERO” by JAM Project really made One Punch Man sound like your classic superhero show. I couldn’t think of a better way to get an episode started. I did not fathom the reasoning behind a love song by Hiroko Moriguchi. It did not suit the mood of the show at all. It has an assuaging sound though. Background noise (e.g. sound of rain) and music was constant and fit well with the action. I like that Madhouse knew when and when not to play background music. It made the show more enjoyable. \\n\\nThe visuals were top notch. The fights have high levels of sakuga. However, the camera moved a little too much for me to fully grasp the choreography, but it still got my attention. The energy radiating from Saitama’s body when he enters superhero mode was amazing. There is not any fanservice apart from censored nude guys flexing muscles. The monsters had crazy character designs (e.g. monster crab in a diaper), but it worked. I loved the two faces of Saitama (serious baldy vs. pacified baldy) drawn all cartoon-like. It gave the show distinctiveness. Saitama resembled a Peanuts comic character when he entered a frustrated or distressed mood. There are variations in the character designs, including a bishounen character. Sometimes the atmosphere didn’t match the characters’ movements. For example, the wind blows. Saitama’s cape flows as the direction of the wind, but Genos’s hair would be at a standstill. There were little still images. The prefecture of the city, the city’s moments of destruction, and background images were well-done. \\n\\nOne Punch Man knows exactly what it is and doesn’t pretend to be something it’s not. It makes full use of its potential as a lighthearted comedy parodying off the superhero genre. For that, I’m glad it didn’t take itself too seriously. I honestly did not get the references to the parody element of One Punch Man (I found out Kamen Rider was one), but I still enjoyed watching it. Madhouse has done it again! \\n\\n*If you dislike jokes that drag on, I advise reading the manga. That tends to be everyone else's go-to.\",\n",
       "  \"Strap yourself in for a rollercoaster of clichés, repetitive fights, and enough yelling to shatter glass. Demon Slayer is a show that throws every shounen trope in the blender, hits puree, and hopes you'll call it a smoothie. Tanjiro, our protagonist, is about as original as a white t-shirt. Whining about his dead family and spouting generic lines about never giving up gets old faster than expired milk. Nezuko, his demon sister, is basically a silent prop with a kawaii box strapped to her back. The supporting cast is a mixed bag of annoying archetypes: the loud boar-head dude, the sleepy drool-fest, and the brooding emowith a tragic backstory. Don't expect any character development beyond power-ups and bigger swords.\\n\\nThe plot? Paper thin. Demon slayers fight demons. Tanjiro cries about his family. Repeat. Rinse. Lather. The fights, while visually flashy, are all variations of the same dance: Tanjiro dodges, Nezuko gets captured, Tanjiro unleashes some flashy CGI move, demon explodes in a shower of purple goo. Rinse. Lather. Repeat.\\n\\nThe animation, admittedly, is pretty slick. But even the most stunning visuals can't distract from the repetitive story, predictable plot twists, and characters so flat they could be used as pizza boxes. The soundtrack is forgettable, except for the opening theme that gets stuck in your head like a bad earworm.\\n\\nDemon Slayer is like a cheap buffet: it looks appealing at first, but after a few bites, you're left feeling greasy and unsatisfied. If you're looking for a shounen anime with genuine innovation, complex characters, and a story that doesn't rehash the same tired tropes, steer clear of this one. You'll thank me later.\\n\\nBonus\\n\\nThe humor is forced and cringeworthy, like watching your grandpa try to do TikTok dances.\\nThe pacing is all over the place, with long, boring stretches punctuated by rushed fight scenes.\\nThe ending is predictable and unsatisfying, leaving you wondering if you wasted your time watching the whole thing.\\n\\nOverall: Demon Slayer is a flashy, soulless slog through tired tropes and predictable plotlines. The characters are one-dimensional caricatures, the animation is mediocre at best, and the music will make you want to rip your ears off. Unless you enjoy melodrama, repetitive battles, and enough crying to fill a slayer's sake gourd, steer clear of this demon-infested disaster.\",\n",
       "  \"I decided to watch this movie because I had seen a lot of people praise it as one of Ghibli's best films, but sadly, it did not live up to the hype for me. Without further ado, let's get into my thoughts: Art and Animation: 10/10 Most of the positive things I have to say about Kaguya-hime are regarding its art style. This movie is incredibly visibly appealing, with its gentle brushstrokes and flowing movements. If I had to pick one thing that I didn't like about it, I would say that the colors could afford to be a bit more vibrant, but that doesn't detract frommy admiration of the visual aspects of this movie. \\n\\nSound: 7/10\\nI watched this in the English dub, and the voice cast was of good quality. The score was nice as well, but it didn't particularly stick out for me.\\n\\nStory: 3/10\\nI knew going into this that Ghibli movies often have brief moments or scenes where I lose interest, but this movie was different. I spent about 80% of the movie uninvested, and another 15% being confused at what was happening. The ending (which I will not spoil) felt sudden, and I feel like there was very little buildup to it. The only scenes I was interested in was the scenes with Kaguya's suitors. \\n\\nThemes: 4/10\\nThe themes of this movie were interesting, but they failed to resonate with me. The theme I was the most interested in was the restrictions of women in high society/nobility/royalty. As a history buff, this topic always interests me when it comes up in media. Sadly, this wasn't touched upon that much. If it was a more present idea in the movie, then I might have liked it more.\\n\\nOverall: 5.5/10\\nI am sure that this is a beautiful and moving movie for many people, but I am not one of them. However, I understand that this movie is loved by lots of people, and I'm glad that it has touched so many people.\",\n",
       "  \"To begin, I mostly stumbled across AoT because of its high rating and under that premise assumed that it has to be somewhat decent, which it is. On the whole though, it didn't strike me as spectacular as some people made it out to be for reasons I shall explain below. Story/Pace: 3/10 To be honest, the first couple of episodes had a wonderful fast pace as the main protagonists advanced, more about their strange world and titan relationship was revealed e.t.c. However, like most animes who give it their full right away, it ran out of ammunition very soon and a good 1/3 of all episodesas of ep 12 (I didn't check, so I may be off) were recaps and comparatively generic giant-vs-human action. So while the story was initially very gripping, I spent the last few episodes grinding my teeth, while hoping for something other than human group A being slaughtered by giant group B to happen and was sorely disappointed. If I only had taken into account the first dozen episodes, this would be an 8-9, but given this endless drawing out, the anime really does not deserve that.\\n\\nCharacters: 4/10\\nThe characters of this anime had their boons/banes, but by tendency, need improvement. Our protagonists are a bit very stereotypical, but made interesting mostly because they keep dying/almost-dying. Generally, all characters are very dramatic and are constantly on the verge of/at a nervous breakdown. Although this would typically annoy me, the anime does deserve credit for making the most convincing war environment I have ever seen (making it much more preferable to those creepy ones where people just casually brush off that their friends just got butchered). \\nThis unique aspect does however trip and fall horribly among the sidecharacters, who both spawn and die like flies. They show up and some of them die 3 episodes later which is very realistic, but perhaps a tad too realistic. I seriously struggled keeping track of all of them and at some point simply gave up on doing so. There are a few more important side characters who will likely survive, but on the whole I find that they all lack depth. One sees too little of them and when one does, they are either killing titans or mourning their friends, which makes it hard to learn new things about them and understand them.\\n\\nArt: 8/10\\nI must agree, that a good part of the artwork in this anime is phenomenally well done. The colours have a nice glow to them and the various phyiscal features are appropriate. In that aspect, the anime deserves substantial credit. I did however, notice a number of moments where the animated component was missing and the characters were shouting at the top of their lungs while statically standing there. Other scenes on the other hand move incredibly smoothly, so it seems a bit lazily done at times. Still on the whole, very good.\\n\\nSound: 7/10\\nThe music of the anime was decent and created an epic feel for the combat scenes. This has however, been done thousands of times and it didn't really stand out among the other animes that practice this. The voice-acting is harder to judge as I am not fluently Japanese, but seemed appropriate. On the whole the sound is good, but nothing special.\\n\\nEnjoyment: 4/10\\nI did enjoy the beginning of this anime, but it then quickly became disappointing due to aforementioned reasons. Towards the end I just felt like skipping ahead to where something interesting was revealed, but the anime ends with ultimately telling little more than what can be garnered from the first few episodes. I did also enjoy the titan fighting, but can say that the 1st titan fight was substantially more impressive than the 30th and as that was the content of all of the episodes, I bored quickly.\\n\\nOverall: 5.2/10\\nOn the whole I feel a bit bitter about the plot's speed, but for those who enjoy  action with high-definition picturesque imagery and epic music, I would recommend it. If you care more about a deep plot with lots of mysteries, don't bother.\",\n",
       "  'This is one of the most overrated anime I\\'ve ever seen. It does start out good, with the set up to the overarching plot and drama and the establishment of characters that would contribute to this. However, as more characters are introduced and the story has increasingly less reason to focus on MC all the time, the anime runs into the all-too-common problem of, not being able to tie up any loose ends and half-assing it at the end by using said increasingly irrelevant MC to act as an anchor. As always I will review this from a perspective of looking out for women\\'s interests. The characterdesigns were completely uninspired, especially at the end, because every female character must be beautiful, while male characters are largely unattractive, whether good or evil, making me immediately dislike the anime. The female characters\\' motivations are at least explored somewhat.\\n\\nI can\\'t say the same thing for the main character, Odokawa. His personality invites a strong feeling that there will be consistent exploration of his character and how it changes with the people he meets. However, despite the entire cast fawning over him in particular, he remains a static character who doesn\\'t seem to have much presence in the world besides \"cool taxi driver.\" He has no meaningful relationships, no contribution to any theme, no well-written reason to be so involved in the plot. I mean sure, he gets somewhat attached to one character in particular, but that nowhere near explains his zeal in getting involved in increasingly dangerous situations, including working with a criminal guy that he kinda-sorta hates (even though this guy namedrops the title in his fucking honor) that he attempts to murder but not really even though he has this sense of justice and fairness...? It is because of all of this, besides the obvious \"ugly guy gets the hot younger girl\" trope pushed on us over and over, that he comes across as a self-insert character for a certain male demographic. And his only memorable \"gimmick\", which gets fully explained by the end of the anime, makes absolutely no sense, because his view of the would should have been made fairly obvious in his behavior if he\\'d lived with that so long, and so many convenient steps were made to reach that discovery, like finding a hospital that managed to keep a fucking DIARY (not even medical documents) of his from elementary school that conveniently explained everything. I mean these side characters were DEVOTED to figuring him out, but in the end, none of this was acknowledged by Odokawa, because again, relationships with others don\\'t affect him, and Odokawa rests well knowing that he doesn\\'t have to put in any work to doing anything besides being cool and coming up with plans because the narrative caters to everything he does.\\n\\nThis all leads to an extremely lackluster ending. In a very cheesy, extremely contrived, and anticlimactic slow-motion scene, everyone\\'s problems are resolved and they all receive some philosophical awakening due to the poorly animated actions of the MC. And of course he is saved by a female character girlbossing her way to save him... somehow, despite having absolutely no training in anything and doing something physically impossible. And to further rub salt in the wound, the \"secret\" he\\'s hiding... turns out to be a completely trivial thing, and there\\'s no explanation as to why this was being hidden in the first place and why so much narrative focus was placed on it. Oh yeah, and this \"trivial thing\" was  red herring to hide some other plot point about a missing girl and the true situation behind that, which also ended up being nonsensical because the antagonists involved in said plot are strangely passionate about their craft, a detail the narrative never cares to address or convince you that this doesn\\'t clash with the down-to-earth tone of this work.\\n\\nOverall, the anime is only worth watching for the opening and ending AMV\\'s. Don\\'t leave it to a single cour (or five fucking volumes of manga) to deliver a multi-layered plot with fleshed out characters and motivations without completely collapsing on itself.',\n",
       "  'Spoilers ahead, I suppose. Discretion advised. __________________________ What a shame, indeed. I get it. The show is about manliness, manic (to the point of suicidal) intentions overcoming the limitations of the universe, parodying the mecha genre and its inherently dark undertones, the innate sense of humanity having the capacity to deal with all the problems that it confronts, the ability to grit one\\'s teeth and tell the world that they are not going to bring them down, so on and so forth. I also understand that you cannot think too hard about what you are seeing on screen: when robots the size of whole galaxies (inexplicably)show up, wondering how they don\\'t take millions of years just to take their next step is the last thing you are supposed to think about. \\n\\nThere are those I respect from whom I heard this show was good. No, the actual words were, \"this anime is a key to my creative abilities\". Given how envious I am of their abilities, I eagerly watched this show. Simon, a boy without a future. Kamina, the man who knows the right words but not the right sense. They become brothers after Simon realises that Kamina has a dream that he can get behind and drill. Fine. The world is keeping them down, so they will first rebel against their village and its narrow ways. Of course, they do not succeed, but they aren\\'t disappointed because, the very next day, everything comes crashing down, starting with a giant robot that has no intention beyond generally causing mayhem, and a teenager named Yoko who wears that ridiculous attire in the name of mobility and comfort. Their world has been a lie, and Kamina is the most satisfied of the bunch, because he can now finally believe in his own memories. So far, so good.\\n\\nThe show progresses and you get caught along with the characters. Then more characters show up. \"O...kay\", I said, \"I suppose this is fine\". They make a pit-stop at \"moral ambiguity village\" where they are treated as gods, because they fell down from the sky, but leave without any real conflict of beliefs. And I realised something was off. Nothing was gained in terms of conviction; they simply chose not to deal with the potential conflict at all. Hmm.\\n\\nAlright. We have a big fight on our hands. But then something bad happens (to only one person among everyone involved in the fighting), and the whole thing grinds to a halt. \"Well, that is what you get for tempting fate all this time, right?\" I blurt out. But, wait, what are these emotions doing here? Remorse? Despair? Impotence (you know, lack of \"manly spirit\" and all that)? Before they can take their toll on the show, Nia shows up, left to die in a sealed coffin (but, somehow, assigned a caretaker, who didn\\'t bother to show up when she was left to die while seemingly wanting to get the protagonists killed earlier in the show). She holds the show back, making sure that it doesn\\'t go the same way Evangelion went, because letting the small things get in the way will kill the momentum. Nia gives the show the dose of morphine that pushes it on until the first half is complete.\\n\\nThen the second half begins. An ominous cloud looms over everyone. Humans have become a prosperous species within just seven years (that is not how humans work, but the show didn\\'t care and it isn\\'t going to start now). Rossiu, Simon\\'s partner and the erstwhile apprentice of the priest of \"moral ambiguity village\", is now starting to darken the mood. Sewage problems, perception of the government he is running, maintaining order. The old guard is completely dumbfounded: they are fighters, not bureaucrats. Simon is apparently at peace, for he \"saved\" the world, but when the Anti-Spirals, opposed to the use of the Spiral Energy that Simon exhibits most brilliantly, attack the Earth, everyone turns on Simon for being himself. Nia is pulled away, with the show making up a new character motivation for her, like it did in the past with her caretaker. Of course, here, Rossiu becomes the centre- having to take decisions he was afraid of taking but ready to accept what must follow. Honestly, this was the closest the show came to becoming interesting: what are the consequences of believing in yourself when not everyone agrees with your methods? Simon never understood this and he almost becomes the ceremonial scapegoat that would be sacrificed for the well-being of Rossiu\\'s government. Of course, another contrivance prevents this, and the show is back on track with its attempts at embarrassing itself with each passing episode. \\n\\nThe show explains that Spiral Energy is a metaphor for the fighting spirit in general and the evolutionary drive which moves all living organisms. The spiralling drill is represented in the double helix of the DNA, changing and constantly bettering itself. The Anti-Spirals believe that this energy will bring about the end of the universe because of something called the Spiral Nemesis, a prophesied (\"prophesied\", \"predicted\", it doesn\\'t make a difference) end-state of the universe when Spiral Energy grows bigger and bigger in each organism that evolves to the point where the organisms begin violating the law of conservation of mass and a black hole sucks up all of existence. I wish that I didn\\'t know half as much as I did about astrophysics and evolution as I did when I watched this show, because all I wanted to do when I heard this explanation was to sit in a corner and cry.\\n\\nI was left wondering what the people I had admired saw in the show. The women never had any real reason to come into conflict with the men after they became significant others- the definition of an idealised relationship. That is why Yoko and Simon could not live their lives with the ones they loved. The whiplash of moving from the first to the second season, only to be told that none of that matters- the definition of a cop-out. The show didn\\'t want to deal with the issues it raises, just move past it. \\n\\nThe juvenile beliefs that thoughtless bravado can accomplish anything is so much easier to swallow when the people dying have not been important all this time and that harebrained schemes work better than any well-thought out plans that might fail was enough to make me yell angrily at the show, because I had realised that there was nothing that I could get from this. People will continue to appreciate this show and speak about how it stands as an epitome of manliness, testosterone, hope, and whatever else they think will get them to stop thinking about their depressing lives. Fine. \\n\\nI\\'m not saying that the show needed to be realistic. What I\\'m saying is, if Evangelion represents depression, this represents mania. Not the mild kind which gives a person all sorts of ideas to keep pushing and do a lot more than they previously could, but the kind that can lead to the hospitalisation of both the person who is suffering from it and the people surrounding this person. This is neither a children\\'s story, nor a story many can connect with unless they have separated themselves from reality to a significant enough degree: Kamina\\'s and Simon\\'s manliness-laden nonsense are used by megalomaniacs with cults of personalities in our world. You listen to them because they stop you from feeling bad about what you could have done, just so long as you sacrifice yourself to their dream. \"There is a better tomorrow\" should not be coming out of the mouths of men who have taken over the responsibility of being the only grown-ups in the world, while they themselves have no real understanding of the losses grown-ups have to deal with. \\n\\nI got up from my chair and got out of my room. \"This show wasn\\'t for you,\" they\\'d say. I sighed. I had lost something that I did not expect to- a sense of stability. What does creativity mean at all? Is this what they, the ones I respect, used to fuel their imaginations that I was in awe of? I had no answer. I closed my eyes, felt a strange discomfort flood my chest, and, realising what this was, I ran to the toilet and let my breakfast come back out of my mouth. I saw the pieces of bread, the half-digested buns of rice among the yellowish brown and I closed my eyes, trying not to remember what I saw throughout the series. I hurled again, and I felt okay. \\n\\nHaving written this, I feel a lot better.'],\n",
