       "['Oh dear Shingeki no Kyojin, where do I even begin. If you\\'ve talked with your friends about anime, then the couple anime that everyone talks about are Naruto, Bleach, One Piece, Dragon Ball, and... Shingeki no Kyojin. What\\'s the difference between Shingeki and the rest? Shingeki only has 25 episodes so far yet it\\'s on par in popularity with the other super long, Americanized anime. Why is it popular? Well that\\'s simply because it\\'s stunningly amazing. Those people that call Shingeki no Kyojin \"overrated\" may not have the same taste as me, and that\\'s perfectly fine, but in my honest opinion, Shingeki no Kyojin isone of if not the greatest anime to be made. It\\'s not popular for no reason.\\n\\nThe story is one of the most captivating stories I\\'ve ever seen. 100 years prior to the start of the anime, humanity has been on the bridge of extinction due to the monstrous humanoid Titans that devour humans. Now, present day in the anime, the remaining small population of mankind lives confined within 3 \"heavenly\" walls that are so tall and sturdy that even the titans can\\'t break in. The most outward wall was named, Wall Maria, the middle wall was named Wall Rose, and the most outward wall named Wall Sina. Unfortunately for mankind, a colossal titan, one that is even bigger than the 50 meter heavenly walls, breaks Wall Maria, allowing the other titans to rampage the city, thus leading to another massacre of mankind. During this massacre, our main characters, Eren Yeager and Mikasa Ackerman watch in horror as a horrifying titan rips their mother\\'s head off, then gobbles her up whole. Vowing that he\\'d one day avenge mankind and exterminate all the titans, Eren Yeager trains to become a survey corp, brave heroic soldiers who go outside the walls, into the plains in order to fight the titans. But we soon find out, that Eren is much more special than he seems, not only is he a brave warrior, but he\\'s also something else that could be the key to humanity\\'s survival, but could also be humanity\\'s destruction. \\n\\nMy 3-word thoughts on the anime: Epic, Dynamic, Masterpiece. The suspense build-up was absolutely amazing, yet there was still room for improvement; that shows just how epic this anime can get. The anime not only includes epic fights, but lots of dialogue, and for those of you that hate dialogue, I feel sorry for you people whom only watch for action. The anime includes lots of other things as well: there\\'s lots of half-hearted, hilarious scenes, as well as sad, tragic scenes. The anime certainly has a good amount of gore, and will break your heart frequently (if you get attached to the characters). Many characters end up getting gobbled up mercilessly while trying to protect humanity in ways that are quite *shivers*. Have I teared up in the anime? As a matter of fact, I have. \\n\\nCharacters was another area (alongside every area) that was Shingeki\\'s strongpoint. There\\'s a diverse variety of characters that fight for humanity for all different reasons. There\\'s trust, friendship, along with betrayals, and pains. There\\'s comedy relief among many characters, especially Sasha \"Potato Girl\" Blouse. There are characters that people can definitely relate with, such as Armin Arlert, who wants to do the right thing and protect his friends, but can\\'t seem to do much because of fear. Fear is something that haunts us all, and prevents us from doing things in life. Another character that people can somewhat relate with is Annie Leonhardt, who fights alongside humanity, yet fights opposed to humanity. What does that mean? Watch the anime. Why is she doing this? Because of her past scars, \"scars have the strange power to remind us that our past is real\" (watch to find out more). There were too many characters to development fully, but certainly the main characters were developed to their max. Levi is certainly a fan-favorite character, because of the fact that he\\'s cool, overpowered, badass, kind-in-the-heart, smart, straight-to-the-point, and most of all, hilarious with all his neat-freakiness. The main character, Eren Yeager is strong-hearted, and \"special\", but he\\'s still not strong enough to defeat the titans. How he develops is one of the most interesting things, in this interesting-things-packed anime. \\n\\nThe art and music can be described in one word: WOW! The art drawings were absolutely stunning! From the characters/titans to the setting of the story to all the equipment used in battle. The characters all had a unique aspect to them. The settings of the anime were beautiful. The cities, and walls looked realistic, the plains that characters dreamed of seeing made me want to run outside to see for myself how beautiful nature really is, and how humans under appreciate the naturality of nature. The 3-D gear was something that really caught my eye, and will certainly catch other people\\'s eyes as well. A new form of action that\\'s never been seen before. The characters would literally fly from rooftop to rooftop slicing their swords at the titans at high-speeds that keep the viewers eyes locked onto the screen at all times. The soundtrack in the anime was epic as shit. The openings speak for themselves, they do the anime justice. The openings were epic and certainly set the mood of what was to come from the anime. \"They\\'re the prey, and we are the hunters!\" The rest of the soundtrack in the anime was okayasgduyasgda AMAZING. How can one describe how amazing those German OSTs were. They fit in perfectly with the epicness of the anime, and certianly added tons of suspense to the 3-D maneuver gear action. \\n\\nOf course, I may be over-thinking things, but the anime certainly included some themes while creating this masterpiece of an anime. The aspect of being confined in an area, doing the same daily routine every day. People seek to be free, and to seek adventure. Watch for this. Another theme that the anime incorporated was that of the cycle of life. Humans, we steal animals away from their families, we kill them, we eat them. What\\'s so different from us, and the titans? The feelings of not being at the top of the food chain... Anyways, if you haven\\'t already watched this anime and you\\'re reading this review, then you\\'ve clearly been living under a rock all this time, and I definitely encourage you to watch this show even if it isn\\'t your style of anime.',\n",
       " 'I started to follow the manga after watching the anime and quite frankly I don\\'t see where and how the plot of Shingeki no Kyojin can suck, which in my humble opinion is awsome. You can understand the anime very well even without having read the manga. However, SNK isn\\'t understood by many because it\\'s a psychological manga .. SNK isn\\'t just a succession of empty and meaningless clashes and, of uncontrolled violence, stereotyped heroes who fight the bad (like Bleach). Here are shown the darkest sides of the human psyche with great mastery: the desire to be the best but can\\'t do it, thedifference between men, their different modes of action (just think about the speech when Eren was discovered in which they show the reactions of the inhabitants of the inner walls Rose) and their motivations, some of the questionable actions that seems to be made in the right and instead the Justice of others that superficially seems foolish and petty (such as the choice of sending refugees to rebuild the wall Mary), freedom and the fact that they don\\'t understand that what others inculcate to us sometimes are nothing more than mental cages. We stop at the appearances only because it suits us ( the walls is a symbol of that). Omitting the main and masterfully developed theme of \"Homo omini lupus\".\\nIn this anime there are no heroes! There are not brave men, without fear, that kill all the wicked. Here there are people who are fighting against their own fear and that sometimes they make it and sometimes not. The enemies aren\\'t the giants !Although the anime does not say from where they come from and I won\\'t do spoilers, it\\'s repeated several times that the enemies are the human beings with their fear (who have surrendered to the giants without doing anything, ignoring and accepting to live like cattle) and the walls! But no one notices that because it would be too challenging to make two questions and wondering: \"Why the walls ? Shouldn\\'t they be their salvation?\" and get an answer.\\nThe fact that many people aren\\'t well characterized, and that physically are not very different from each other isn\\'t a coincidence .. Isayama is putting on the same level all human beings, he is saying that we are all like that guy who shoots himself alone after he surrendered to fear, that we are all as Vernam (who during the attack fled from Trost ), that there is some of us who is better than others, but that we all live under the same fears, and even if we react differently, we act according to substantially the same nature. It still tells us that we might be the protagonists of our life, choosing our destiny, but only if we are ready to go beyond the stereotypes and mindsets that others impose to us, only if only if we work with all our strength. Because living by what others tell us, from what they show us, isn\\'t to live, but survive!\\nAnd in addition to all the various points of reflection that SNK has to offer (and there are many, not just those listed ), there is a plot full of twists and turns, the suspense. In short, it is a masterpiece. \\nThen, if you are used to an anime where the bad guys magically becomes good after a lesson or in which the characters acquire super powers from nothing or from old men who appearing in their minds... Well, ok ...... that ... that\\'s original and profound ........\\n(Hope my english was not so bad) :)',\n",
       " 'In the 80\\'s, Mobile Suit Gundam catapulted anime in Japan. In the 90s, Dragon Ball Z broke the mainstream walls while Neon Genesis Evangelion opened the doors to the now indispensable late-night anime slots in Japan. In the 2000s, Fullmetal Alchemist marked the peak of manga-to-anime adaptations while Code Geass & Death Note headed the class of those who introduced the new anti-hero genre. And now, in 2013, Attack on Titan has shaken the industry once again. Unless you\\'ve been living under a rock for the past 5 months, you should at least know what the story is about, and for the sake of staying spoiler free, I\\'m notgoing into details on the plot.\\n\\nBefore I wrote this review, I wrote a different piece moments after watching the first episode stating that Attack on Titan had all the potential to become a landmark anime, knowing very little of how true that statement would turn out to be.\\n\\nI have watched anime ever since I can remember. I have seen the very best and the worst that this industry has to offer. And I, like most of you, am very familiar with the relationship of manga-anime adaptation, which is the case of Attack on Titan. It is because of such experience and knowledge that I am able to say with so much confidence that Attack on Titan is the best anime series ever produced from any standpoint, at least, in the last decade.\\n\\nAttack on Titan is such a well-done product that it has all the key strong points we all dream every series could have. By this I mean the story, characters, animation, OST, opening/ending sequences, art, directing, narrative, character development, and, most importantly, the \"it\" factor. These are all present with \"A grade\" production values. \\n\\nFirst of all, I want to start with the OST. Simply put, Attack on Titan\\'s soundtrack rivals that of Rurouni Kenshin and Evangelion. Period. Don\\'t misunderstand, they are not similar by any means, they are simply equally as masterful. Check on the internet the impressions left by fans about the first soundtrack. And if you still don\\'t believe me, tweet Hideo Kojima (creator of Metal Gear series) and ask his take on it.\\n\\nThe OST is extremely important in this show because it allows you to feel the many epic moments that dwell in this 25 episode marvel. This is where the directing and narrative play a big role. For those of you who have seen Death Note (same director), you will feel an extra feeling of similarity with Attack on Titan, as the show relies heavily on its intense emotional scenes which you most certainly will feel the first 2 minutes of episode #1. \\n\\nIt is in these scenes where the golden cast of characters shine. I cannot stress enough how unique the characters are. You could say they are the cream of the many accolades that Attack on Titan has. I\\'m still amazed by the quality of voice actors that just seem to just pop out in this show. The voices of so many main characters from hit series come together in Attack on Titan to help provide that epic feeling you start to get once episode #1 ends. Note I emphasize the voice acting because it\\'s part of the anime but, obviously, not of the manga. \\n\\nAnother key strong point is the work and effort put on the OP/ED sequences. If you\\'ve come this far in my review then you most likely understand when I say that Openings and Ending sequences are crucial. They provide that extra excitement to the show. It\\'s definitely something not all anime series take seriously. Fortunately, Wit Studio took them seriously, and then came \"Guren no Yumiya\". The second opening, \"Jiyuu no Tsubasa\" is outstanding and marvelous in its own way and the second ending, \"great escape\", fuels that adrenaline rush of excitement you will get after those killing cliffhangers. Having said that, the first OP, \"Guren no Yumiya\", is simply epic. If there was ever something to describe as epic, it would be this OP. I am certain that as of today, it is the greatest anime opening ever. I\\'m amazed by the amount of attention it got on the internet and the hundreds of parodies derived from it. It was simply a treat to our eyes. The song. The animation in the opening. The sync between the two. Epic. \\n\\nYou won\\'t be skipping that opening.\\n\\nIn addition, an animation production is never as close to perfection without the animation and art being top class. Now, Attack on Titan has astonishing art, to the point where you are amazed of how far animation has come. The scenes where there is sunlight will leave you speechless. The animation, unlike the other aspects, is where some disagree. The only thing I have to say is I was extremely impressed throughout the whole show until I saw a certain scene in episode #11 where the 3D maneuver gear was used, and I was stunned. I was simply stunned. Then, of course, later episodes also take it to a whole new level, but you\\'re probably gonna be used to that quality of greatness by then.\\n\\nThat\\'s how ridiculously good Attack on Titan is.\\n\\nNow, like the characters, the story is mostly work of the manga\\'s author. This includes character development, which I believe is the key to the success and extreme popularity of the characters. Also, the story maybe the most original aspect of this series. Nothing you have seen before is in this show. Nothing. Much like EVA, Attack on Titan gives you a world of \"dystopia\", on-edge, and uncertainty, so full of potential that just when you think you have it figured it out, it turns around and leaves you speechless. \\n\\nOh, that will happen to you for the first time in episode #5. Guaranteed. \\n\\nFinally, even IF all these characteristics of an anime series are top notch, it won\\'t amount to its potential if it doesn\\'t have that \"IT\" factor. Some series have the \"IT\" factor without having all of these production values. They tend have 3 or 4 at most. Those become popular because they give out that feeling of \"amazing\". Gintama, the greatest gag series ever, comes to mind. Its anime doesn\\'t have overwhelming OST, or eye popping animation; it does have A class characters and A class story (among others), but that \"IT\" factor takes it to another level. Now, imagine having practically everything an anime series has to offer in A class value while also having that \"IT\" factor. Extremely rare. Eva rare. FMA rare. Attack on Titan is part of that elite group. This is why its popularity rose to highs only few series reach.\\n\\nThis is the first time I have ever written a detailed review of an anime series. I did it because this one deserves it. It\\'s The anime series of my adult era. I can now relate to those anime fans who watched Evangelion almost 20 years ago. They knew they had something special, just like we do now with Attack on Titan. \\n\\nIn conclusion, Attack on Titan is, of course, like MS Gundam, DBZ, EVA, FMA, Geass, and Death Note, not perfect. Like any other piece of greatness it does have its negatives. Having said that, when you add up the good and the bad, you end up with a landmark anime series that is currently shaking the industry with its mesmerizing, sensational, emotional, intense, and inspiring first season. Just imagine the wait and the hype for season 2. \\n\\nWhat kind of effect will Attack on Titan have on the anime/manga industry we love? Only time will tell...\\n\\nIn the meantime, this is simply the best anime series in the last 15 years. Enjoy.\\n\\nExquisite beyond words.\\n101/100.',\n",
       " 'Shingeki no Kyojin... Where do I start? In summary, Shingeki no Kyojin is a perfect anime to get somebody who loves action started on anime- I think it is literally the most mainstream anime ever made, and that is definitely not a bad thing. But with this comes downsides- ones not apparent to the viewer at first glance, but looking back on it after watching it around the time it first came out, definitely shine through. Shingeki no Kyojin starts off with a roar- the first 2 episodes explode right out of the gate with high-octane action that also leaves mystery to draw the viewer in. Whoare the titans? What is in the basement? Why is Eren\\'s dad so creepy? All this and more the viewer asks themselves as the end credits roll for episode 2.\\n\\nThen episode 3 and 4 jump in. It\\'s a training scene for Eren and his friends, and it\\'s dead slow in comparison. But that\\'s ok- it\\'s episodes like this that reinforce character development and get the plot rolling. And soon, the episodes with action will begin again, right? That High-Octane, bloody, gory action we\\'ve all been waiting for!\\n\\nWell, it does. But then shortly after, it grinds back to a halt. Why do I bring up the first 5 episodes out of all things to mention about Shingeki no Kyojin? Because it perfectly frames the pacing of the entire anime. First you\\'re baited with that sweet, bloody action that makes you just stare at the screen in amazement of the beautiful animation and heart-pumping soundtrack, and next thing you know you have to sit through an hour of people arguing over the same issue over and over before going back to the action. This would be fine and acceptable if it actually resulted in plot and character development going somewhere- but rarely this bickering between Armin and Eren result in anything productive.\\n\\nActually, Shingeki no Kyojin seems to show perfectly how to pull off the ILLUSION of plot and character development- Eren struggling with his inner demons despite somehow going back to square 1 every 5 episodes, the Basement which has been explicitly mentioned as having \"all the answers\" being completely forgotten about while the group goes out to hunt titans, and Armin rehashing what we already know to other characters every episode or two. All of this combined create a huge mess that on first glance seems like a deep and interesting story, but only through reflection of a different lens you begin to notice how shallow the pool you\\'re standing in really is. The characters are shallow, the story tries to go somewhere but the characters almost seem to prevent it from moving at all, and at some points the story tries to go to too many places at once, just confusing the viewer until the next trippy action scene kicks in.\\n\\nI like to compare Shingeki no Kyojin to a Michael Bay film. This also makes it easier to understand what I\\'m trying to say (and trust me, it\\'s not your fault- I have a hard time expressing what I feel in words sometimes).\\n\\nImagine Eren as Shia Labeouf, and Shingeki no Kyojin as a typical summer blockbuster by Michael Bay. Eren zips around the scenes of the movie, fighting bad-guys and pulling off amazing stunts with beautifully rendered graphics and an amazing ost- but then hardcut to Eren getting mad at himself and people around him but not actually advancing the plot for 1/3rd of the movie as the action grinds to a halt. Add some comedic relief (if you want a Bay comparison, the classic transformers out of place masturbation joke fits well) including possibly some potatoes after a traumatic scene and then slap on the illusion of having a deep plot and you have Shingeki no Kyojin. It\\'s a typical summer blockbuster! You go in, watch it, enjoy it, then leave and forget about it! I\\'m really not saying you\\'re not allowed to enjoy it because it\\'s shallow and noisy, I\\'m just saying you shouldn\\'t walk in expecting a revolutionary masterpiece of anime- which is what some critics are raising it up to be.\\n\\nSTORY- 4 : The story\\'s foundations are put up well, but the actual progression falls flat as no questions are ever really answered and the plot never seems to want to go in a single direction.\\nART- 9 : The art is amazing! There are some worse-off scenes and some animation glitches, but the art is one of the things that makes Shingeki no Kyojin stand out from the crowd. Even though I am not a huge fan of the anime itself, I have a massive poster above my computer of it as we speak.\\nSOUND- 10 : While the music and sound design is generic at worst, it is composed beautifully and always reinforces the mood set out by the show. I would highly recommend a download of the OST.\\nCHARACTER- 3 : Easily the worst part of Shingeki no Kyojin. Eren\\'s constant back and forth attitude and behaviour that never goes anywhere, Armin\\'s arguing with people that last an entire episode simply to recap what just happened on screen, Mikasa\\'s constant fight to try and save everyone and pull everything together: it\\'s just all poorly done.\\nENJOYMENT- 6 : While watching Shingeki no Kyojin, I certainly enjoyed it- but I wouldn\\'t say I enjoyed it the whole way through. Even while watching it, I noticed a lot of the fighting and arguing was going on too long, and let\\'s not forget the 3-5 episodes of riding on horses. But the scenes that were enjoyable- notably the fight scenes and the pivotal plot twists certainly left a lot to talk about and were enjoyable enough to at least somewhat wipe away two annoying characters yelling at eachother on horses for 30 minutes.\\n\\nOVERALL- 5: Watch it, get what you get out of it, but don\\'t walk in expecting the next amazing revolutionary anime. Expect a summer blockbuster.',\n",
       " 'Every once in a while, and even more frequently now than in the past, an anime appears that is completely and unequivocally shrouded in layers upon layers of hype and popularity from the anime community. It\\'s the show that\\'s on everyone lips, as well as everyone\\'s TV screens. In the Fall of 2011, The Future Diary created an exceptional level of hype that had not been seen for quite some time. When the Summer of 2012 rolled along, it was time for Sword Art Online to take the spotlight, and its own popularity grew toheights far beyond that of The Future Diary. Then, in the Spring of 2013, we were treated to what one could consider the Game of Thrones or the Breaking Bad of the anime industry in terms of sheer popularity; a show that completed engulfed the entire anime community, dwarfing even SAO in popularity, but is this anime truly worthy of the hype that it received?\\n\\n          Our story is set in an alternate universe where, 100 years prior to the events of the story, giant humanoid creatures known as Titans appeared and began consuming and decimating the human population, though with no apparent purpose for doing so. In response, the remainder of humanity built three enormous, circular walls to encompass their entire population and keep the Titans at bay. In this world, we meet three young children Eren Yeager, his adopted sister Mikasa, and their friend Armin, as they live out their peaceful lives in the southernmost city at the edge of the outer wall, Wall Maria. This soon changes, however, when a 60-meter Titan smashes through the main gate of Wall Maria, allowing Titans to freely enter the city and devour every human in sight, and forcing those who lived in the outer districts to retreat behind Wall Rose. During the chaos, Eren witnesses his mother being eaten by a Titan, and now he, Mikasa, and Armin have joined the military in the hopes of acquiring the skills necessary to take vengeance on the creatures that destroyed their lives.\\n\\n          This series, as a whole, has almost completely mastered the art of building suspense, mostly through the use of very long plot arcs. There always seems to be something constantly pushing towards a conclusion, but not actually getting there until several episode later, and that push factor creates a sensation of rarely ever wanting to stop watching for fear of the resolution being just after the episode you just watched. Additionally, this series is also a master of what I call the \"morale builder,\" something that Gurren Lagann has shown mastery of in the past, and there are dozens of moments throughout the series where, no matter how grim and horrifying the situation, it provides an uplifting or rallying feeling that both immerses you in the world its sets up and makes you root for our heroes to the bitter end.\\n\\n          Speaking of grim and horrifying, that comparison to Game of Thrones earlier was far from being an off-handed comment. By this I mean that I hope you don\\'t enjoy getting attached to characters, like I do, as you may find yourself curled up in a corner at some point. In the world of fiction, particularly in action series, there is a concept called \"plot armor,\" which basically means that characters who seem crucial to the plot\\'s progression and the show\\'s stability as a whole are protected from death or other nasty fates that might await them. In this regard, the plot armor for Attack on Titan is about as thick as a used piece of tin foil, and deaths of major characters are frequent and often times unrelenting. In regards to this, and on a more personal note, there are only three anime that have actually made me legitimately cry before. Two of them were KyoAni series, and the third was Attack on Titan. This show really does not care about who your favorite character is, and if you\\'ve made it this far without having had the major deaths in the series spoiled for you yet, then consider yourself lucky.\\n\\n          Unfortunately, there is one minor flaw with this series. There are certain points, especially at some slightly slower moments in the series, where its gets a little too over-dramatic, to the point of almost being ridiculous. This was especially noticeable during what is now referred to as the \"Boulder Arc,\" which encompasses roughly episodes 10-12. These moments are few and far between however, and are immediately drowned out once the hype builds back up again.\\n\\n          On the character front, for the sake of not getting your hopes up about the prospects of certain characters living, I\\'ll talk only about the three main characters I mentioned earlier, with the knowledge that the rest of the cast, while incredibly massive in scale, still serves as a stellar group of vibrant personalities and ideals to create a surprisingly organic social environment. As for the big three, we\\'ll start with Armin, who takes on the \"smart one/strategist\" archetype. While he is fairly generic and standard at the beginning of the series, we get to see him grow into being a more varied character at a constantly shifting rate, and his skills at strategy both on the battlefield and in complex conversations are practically unmatched, often allowing him the power to save the other two from the situations they get themselves into.\\n\\n          Next is Mikasa, who, for the majority of the series, is portrayed as being essentially flawless, taking on the role of the unstoppable badass Titan slayer fresh out of training who also makes time to coddle her adoptive brother, and this flawlessness is built up to the point of it almost being a flaw in itself. There are, however, a few quirks to her personality that make her feel more human, but at the same time make her seem even more distant. Her only notable \"flaw\" seems to be her undying loyalty and devotion to Eren, often throwing caution to the wind and bolting out against orders in order to make sure he\\'s safe. This also leads to some rather disquieting moments where her own sanity seems to abandon her and, to put it lightly, causes her to act excessively hostile towards anyone who means ill will towards Eren.\\n\\n          Finally, we have Eren, our stereotypical \"perseverance\" character whose sole motivation for the majority of the season is taking revenge on the Titans, and while this does seem like a bit of a gaping flaw for the show\\'s main character, it\\'s actually both understandable and sort of refreshing. His intense focus on his own rage and desires for revenge slowly consumes part of who he is, which becomes especially present at several points throughout the series that I can\\'t go further into detail on due to massive amounts of spoilers.\\n\\n         The animation was produced by Wit Studios, a new studio that serves as a surrogate of Production I.G. Regardless of its heritage, for a new studio to create such a massively impressive project is beyond incredible. Not only is the animation well-polished, but it also carries its own distinctive style, most notably in the fact that its characters are heavily outlined in varying thicknesses of black to make them pop out from the background. Speaking of backgrounds, the environments are shown to be incredibly rich and detailed despite how unvaried they may appear on the surface, and the action shots give us plenty of different perspectives on this environment. As for the action itself, Wit Studios has no qualms at all with handing out incredible fight sequences by the barrel-full via an in-world tool used by humanity\\'s military known as 3D Maneuver Gear, allowing us to break away from standard ground combat and enter the world of high-flying intensity, with soldiers bolting off of every building in sight, into the air above them, and landing blade-first on the neck of a Titan. On course, all of these brilliant combinations of animation are to be expected from Araki, who has already brought us both the intensely stylized atmosphere of Death Note and the blood-pumping action of Guilty Crown.\\n\\n         The dub was produced by FUNimation, and, as someone who watched the subbed version first, I have no problems whatsoever recommending this dub. From heavy-hitting new favorites like Josh Grelle and Matthew Mercer to classic icons like Vic Mignogna and Caitlin Glass, Funimation has pulled out all the stop to create one of the best dubs this side of 2010. Grelle shuffles between nervously unstable and frantically stern for his portrayal as Armin, and Trina Nishimura pulls off both Mikasa\\'s warmth and ferocity to near perfection. My only notable flaw with the dub is Bryce Papenbrook as Eren. To be fair, this is definitely Papenbrook\\'s best performance yet, due in no small part to Mike McFarland\\'s exceptional voice directing, but he does still tend to get a bit \"Bryce-y\" at some points and lets his excessively angsty style boil over, which is a rather dangerous idea considering Eren\\'s character. Overall though, this is a minor blemish on an otherwise excellent dub.\\n\\n         The music was composed by Hiroyuki Sawano (Aldnoah.Zero, Kill la Kill), and this soundtrack is definitely one of the best to come out of anime in a long time, based in heavy orchestrations and laced throughout with electronica and hard rock. From the bombastic explosions of \"E.M.A\" and main theme \"Attack on Titan\" to the insert tracks of \"The Reluctant Heroes\" and \"Doa,\" this soundtrack dabbles in the art of perfection on all fronts. If it seems like I\\'m being much more in-depth with the soundtrack than usual, it\\'s because I\\'ve actually purchased the soundtrack on iTunes and have been listening to it practically non-stop, and I highly recommend making this purchase as well. Both opening themes, \"Guren no Yumiya\" and \"Jiyuu no Tsubasa,\" were performed by Linked Horizon and give us massive eruptions of heavy rock combined with brass and vocal choirs (and on a quick aside, I\\'m one of the few people that actually preferred the second theme more than the first, though the first still kicks all sorts of ass). The first ending theme \"Utsukushiki Zankoku na Sekai\" by Yoko Hikasa gives us a rolling ballad to play us out of each episode, while the second ending theme \"great escape\" by Cinema Staff blasts through with a heavy rock track. Additionally, all of these tracks except \"great escape\" are available for purchase on iTunes, purchases that I also highly recommend.\\n\\n         Overall, Attack on Titan is simply an incredible experience, combining high-flying action that could even make ufotable nervous with a dark and nearly-overwhelming sense of fear and desperation, and this anime is more than deserving of the hype that it receives. However, as it stands right now, on November 4, 2014, the series is incomplete, and there has been no announcement of a second season yet. I highly doubt that this second season will never come however, and it has been reported that the original manga is planned to be finished in about four years’ time (which actually isn\\'t that much material for a monthly manga). In the meantime, there will be plenty of specials and spin-offs to keep us satiated until season 2 is officially announced.\\n\\n          Attack on Titan is currently licensed by FUNimation and is available from them for both streaming and purchase.',\n",
       " 'Attack on Titan is a particularly unique case for me. As such, my review needs to be broken up to properly analyze it. Story: Attack on Titan has an absolutely astounding setting. The sheer idea behind the setting, the exposition pieces, and the initial plot elements held the potential for it to be one of the best action anime ever. From the first three episodes, I could see how someone could believe this would be that one anime that is just absolutely amazing. It simply becomes disappointing as things continue. Long story short? The start is absolutely amazing. It\\'s powerful. It\\'s grabbing. It does everythingan introduction should do. The problem after that stems from the plot slowly becoming painfully predictable and a personal dissatisfaction with the protagonists in place as well as the decisions of various members of the cast completely destroying the story\\'s credibility at times. \\n\\nArt:\\n\\nArt is completely subjective. I would not actually judge art based on someone\\'s own opinion. You would really have to see it for yourself to deem whether it is \"good\" or not. As for me, it seemed fairly mediocre. The effort is there, but something with the art style simply does not jive with me. The settings are well done, but the characters are quite bland. \\n\\nSound:\\n\\nFinally. This is what I can praise Attack on Titan for. If anything, this series\\'s soundtrack deserves to be remembered. It is excellent and its execution throughout the anime was not only strategic but tasteful. The tracks range from dark and depressing to powerful and moving pieces designed for a battle against a completely hopeless situation. In my opinion, the music in and of itself is the true beauty behind this anime. \\n\\nCharacters: \\n\\nThe main protagonist Eren Jeager is heavily set on his goal to a fault. Some call this good writing, but given the setting, it actually works against the story and its credibility. It is literally almost difficult to not find the main character\\'s obsession with revenge nostalgic and downright hilarious. If you don\\'t like avenger-type characters, you will despise Eren beyond imagination by the time the story is over. The worst part? He finally starts developing three-quarters through and goes right back to the bratty child he was in the first few eps. The same can be said of Mikasa. This anime is one of the few to portray women with some form of decency, but Mikasa\\'s obsession with Eren is a pretty sad window of how the author wants people to worship his poorly-designed protagonist. To boot, Mikasa literally has no flaws other than her obsession with Eren. No character flaws. No ability flaws. Her only real flaw is her obsession with Eren, which usually only winds up helping them, not causing them problems like it should. Your only real likable protagonist? Armin. He is one of maybe three characters we really see that has a solid character, solid flaws, and solid development based on those flaws and his interactions with other characters due to the plot. In all honesty, Armin should have been the main protagonist. \\n\\nEnjoyment:\\n\\nNow we move onto enjoyment. Despite vehemently despising roughly eighty-five percent of the cast, I enjoyed Attack on Titan. Is it a great action anime? Sure. Definitely! Is it realistic? Sad to say, but no it is not. Is it the most well-written anime ever? Astronomically far from it. If you\\'re looking for an action anime to sit down and enjoy, this is a wonderful choice. If you\\'re looking for an action anime with a strong plot and emphasis on lovable characters, I recommend pretending that you never heard the hype and staying far away from this anime. \\n\\nWith a heavy heart, I cannot give the anime anything higher than a 5/10 in good conscience. It had oodles of potential, but an irritating cast, some half-baked plot elements, and predictability ruined it. Mediocre at best.',\n",
       " 'So what on earth? What have I done? How am I not able to feel the stun?... I will write about \"Attack on Titan\" here; but yeah, I\\'m no fanboy trying to endear myself to mainstream now or in the longer run. I turned towards this show unbiased considering its popularity at highest. I wanted to see if this action show at least conveys more meanings than being a bloody feast.But in the end: people and story at its driest.\\n\\nSo hundreds of years ago, the humankind\\nis letting itself be completely confined\\nby dim-witted looking titans there\\ninside a 50-meter wall ensnare\\nand is now searching for ways to get behind.\\n\\nThen suddenly, a 60-meter giant attacks\\nand many more titans are making their tracks.\\nThe wall can\\'t hold it anymore\\nand so the humans are fighting another war.\\nTheir enemies won\\'t give them more time to relax!\\n\\nThe first few episodes are quite intense,\\nexperiencing human\\'s crumbling defence,\\ngetting their normal lives torn up again,\\nhaving to survive in a diminishing den,\\nand nearly losing their last kind of sense.\\n\\nWe follow Eren, who has to sustain\\nhis mother\\'s loss, indeed a great pain.\\nHe wants to kick some titan\\'s ass\\nand finally falls into the shounen mass,\\nalways acting like tightened by an angry chain.\\n\\nAccompanied by one of the few\\nmore normal humans, Mikasa, whose true\\nintention is to save her Eren\\nand so she\\'s getting ears more barren\\ndespite her strength she would rather sue.\\n\\nThe third in league, weak fair-haired Armin, stays\\nthe cowardly one with a frightened face.\\nHe tends to think far more than others\\nbut is mostly hindering his brothers.\\nHe needs lots of time to realise his place.\\n\\nSo maybe you would think that some other\\nguys inside these walls don\\'t try to bother,\\nbut instead act more heroic inside this hell.\\nYou see, Commander Levi\\'s the only one memorable;\\nhe wouldn\\'t even trade his tenacity for his mother.\\n\\nAll in all, these characters just won\\'t try\\nto develop properly and we ask why?\\nWhy haven\\'t they used episodes five to twelve\\nto let them build some features or delve\\ninto their motivations or what they go by?\\n\\nSeriously, you won\\'t remember any other names.\\nThey die like flies and only the main remains.\\nSo I really wondered the whole time where\\nthe more seasoned soldiers would deign to dare\\nto get into the fight, but you know what it claims...\\n\\nAnd then, the probably most important thing:\\nWhat are the titans? Ruled by a king?\\nWhat are their bloody true intentions?\\nHinder humanity from some kind of interventions?\\nWe aren\\'t informed, and that\\'s a serious sting.\\n\\nHowever, the style and art does kind of save all it\\nfrom falling into a much more deeper pit.\\nDetailed architecture and nice quality,\\nalthough the animations strive for equality,\\nbut the art got me astounded, I must admit!\\n\\nWhat you will hear is mostly amazing.\\nThe music improves the already fast pacing\\nbut cannot reach my most favourite sides\\nlike Code Geass with \"Stories\" provides.\\nSo it\\'s epic, and rather the common saving.\\n\\nSpecial mention for an awesome opening theme\\nmixing German and Japanese for deserved esteem.\\nIt conveys this rather intimidating mood,\\nlets us taste of the upcoming action food.\\nBelieving the whole show\\'s that epic: it stays a dream.\\n\\nNow summarizing art and sound: they\\'re nice;\\nbut paying with a decent story at least twice.\\nMan, there are so many episodes for fill,\\nthe pacing is off, the direction needs skill,\\ninferring that eight episodes clearly would suffice.\\n\\nSome people will ask how I can say\\nthis show is average and carried away...\\nIt has nothing like a memorable plot\\nand tends to dramatize quite a lot,\\njust not worth for every fan to stay!\\n\\nI can\\'t deny the certain amount of joy\\nthe first few episodes deliver, oh boy!\\nBut after that, it\\'s nothing new...\\nNo inspirations I aim to pursue...\\nIts part to perplex hardly evens the one to annoy.\\n\\nSo this practically concludes my review.\\n\"Do not believe the hype\" became so true!\\nIf you like some standard action shows,\\nthen Attack on Titan doesn\\'t have much to oppose,\\nbut otherwise it isn\\'t worth any ballyhoo.',\n",
       " 'I started watching Shingeki no Kyojin a year ago, almost to the day that I am writing this. So I figured I would write a review on what has grown to be one of my favourite series of all time. What I\\'ve noticed is that people tend to be very split about this anime; you either love it, or you hate it. Clearly, in my case, I love this entire series (the show, the manga, the side-stories, etc.) Now onto the actual review. Story: 9 At its core, Shingeki no Kyojin is something that we have seen many times in the past: humanity is being attacked, therefore wemust defend ourselves. Many, many iconic shows start from this format. However, SNK (as I will be calling it for the rest of the review) takes this simple plot point and expands it into something very, very unique. We have the Titans: giant, humanoid creatures set on devouring humans. Because of the Titans, humanity has been driven behind three walls, with the population dwindling to less than 1% of our current population. \\n\\nEach and every single plot point in this series is completely thought out and executed stunningly. There are so many twists that you won\\'t be able to see coming. Hell, check out episode 8- you\\'ll be shocked. Even the filler is thought out, and has important significance to the main story. The story of SNK goes even further in the manga. At the time of writing this review, there has been 59 chapters released, and we are just only starting to scratch the surface of this world.\\n\\nLike most things out there, SNK does have its flaws. But the flaws are so minuscule that it\\'s very, very hard to notice them. The brilliant storytelling of this series completely blew me away from episode 1, which is why it deserves a near perfect score.\\n\\nArt: 9\\nIf you have read the SNK manga, you\\'ll know that the art, while it is good, isn\\'t amazing. The anime cleaned up all of the character designs, leaving us with a beautiful result. While there were some minor changes in characters (ex Eren\\'s eye colour, Levi\\'s physique, etc,) the anime designs did stay pretty true to the original material. The designs match the characters\\' personalities completely, which is something that not a lot of shows can brag about.\\n\\nAnd the animation is breathtaking. Every single sky we see, the birds eye views; the scenery in this anime is absolutely stunning. And the animation for the characters and their situations is pretty great, too. To me, this is digital animation to the finest degree. But again, as is the case with most shows, SNK does have some animation flaws. For example, in one episode, the same frame is shown about three times. The characters can also have a case of \"far away face\", but that is pretty common. Again, these flaws in animation are pretty small, and are barely noticeable when you are watching the show. They do not take away from the rest of the show.\\n\\nSound: 10\\nThe score for SNK was done by Hiroyuki Sawano. If you don\\'t recognize his name, he also composed the score for things like Kill la Kill, Ao no Exorcist, and more recently Aldnoah.Zero. If I could use any one word to describe the sound of SNK, it would be flawless. The score matches every scene perfectly, mixing electronics with more orchestral pieces. If you don\\'t have any interest in watching the show, I would still suggest you download the OSTs. The sound for this show blew me away. Even the background noises, the additional sound FX- they were all done to the utmost perfection.\\n\\nThe openings and endings for SNK were all absolutely amazing. It\\'s no wonder that Guren no Yumiya in particular has landed on many \"top 10 anime openings\" lists. The songs will get stuck in your head, and refuse to leave. In my case, they have not left in a year, and that\\'s something that is very hard to do in my case. Just check out the OPs and EDs online; you\\'ll be amazed at how great they are.\\n\\nAnd the voice acting is nothing to laugh at, either. With many shows that I\\'ve seen, I\\'ve noticed that the voices don\\'t match with the characters. Either the voice is too weak, too bold, meek, etc- this is not the case with SNK. Each character is voiced perfectly; each voice matches the personality of the character. The passion put into the voice acting of the show is nothing to laugh at. The voice actors were able to portray each and every line and emotion perfectly, which is something very hard to do. The dub is a different story (but we don\\'t talk about the dub....)\\n\\nCharacter: 9\\nThis is where most people decided whether they love or hate this show. To be fair, the characters in SNK can sometimes seem a little extreme with their personalities. However, I love them. For example, the main character Eren can seem very angry, very passionate. Some people hate this. They think he\\'s just a trope amped up to the extreme. In my opinion, Eren\\'s character was done perfectly. His \"extreme\" emotions fit his personality up to a T. \\n\\nThe personalities of each character in this show are fleshed out near perfectly, in my opinion. Again, some aspects can seem extreme, but that is part of the enjoyment of this series. Not one character is deemed as \"perfect.\" They each have their flaws, which makes them seem very human and realistic. As the story goes on, each point in each characters\\' personality is explained in detail, even if it seems unimportant initially.\\n\\nEach character in this series serves a purpose. The main characters, the main supporting characters, the regular supporting characters- each and every one of them is important. There is a lot of death in this show, but every single death we see is important to the story and the character development. And while some deaths may seem insignificant, they really aren\\'t. The entire emotional journey of this series stems from the characters, and SNK has pretty powerful ones.\\n\\nEnjoyment: 10\\nI\\'m not a fan of blood and gore. Really, I\\'m not. There have been several shows, live-action or animated, that I have had to drop because of their content. When a show like SNK, which has copious amounts of both blood and gore, can become one of my favourites, you know that it is amazing.\\n\\nEvery single episode of SNK had me captivated. Even the filler ones. Each and every episode was an emotional journey from start to finish. Waiting for the episodes to air every week was torture, because I so desperately wanted to see everything happen (even if I had already read the manga.) I loved every single episode, even the OVAs that have been released. Each release had me on edge, with both the show and the manga. Nothing was dull; everything was riveting.\\n\\nOverall: 9\\nThere is a reason why this show doesn\\'t score perfect. It has its flaws, as everything does. But there is also a reason why it scores so high.\\n\\nShingeki no Kyojin was one of the most popular, if not the MOST popular anime of 2013. There is a reason for this. There is a reason why so many people watch, read, and enjoy this series, even if they\\'re not into anime or manga. There is a reason why there are copious amounts of fan works for this series. There is a reason why so much merchandise has been released. There is a reason why so many people cosplay characters from this series.\\n\\nLike it or hate it, you really can\\'t deny how popular it is. I personally love everything about it. Keep in mind that this is only my opinion; other people will tell you different things. But to me, Shingeki no Kyojin is stunning.',\n",
       " \"Let's get straight to it! Shingeki no Kyojin is an incredibly gripping, action packed show, and it is certainly capable of converting non-anime watchers. When you begin to understand the plight of humanity versus the titans, you'll quickly begin to realize that this is a show of epic proportions - essentially it is an inter species war: and violence comes hand in hand with this theme, so squeamish viewers might want to look elsewhere. The show is incredibly engaging, and intense because the combat animations are executed perfectly, giving a really personal front row seat throughout. Not only this but peril is constantly a reinforced aspectof the anime, and what's scarier is the accurate scale of death that isn't afraid to engulf those that the viewer has become connected to.\\n\\nI'm liking this logical order, because with death brings me to the next area i'd like to explain: Drama! Oh boy you'll be astounded by the dramatic, emotional and often angry outbursts of the characters. I personally would rank Shingeki no Kyojin highly in all of its presentation methods.\\n\\nBut that's not all, because in addition to being well presented, violent and dramatic, the show still then has the drive to steer you into corners via breakthroughs in the story. Another beautiful aspect of the show is that although the context would say that humanity had been surviving for over a century, the titans are still a great mystery to the present characters, therefore putting you (the viewer) on the front line for discovering more!\\n\\nDespite how i'm in awe with so many parts of the anime, the story if i'm honest is a bit too linear, as in i don't think enough goes on behind the scenes of titan combat. The plot summary introductions are also a pain due to their repetitiveness, it really is easy to pick up the story line behind the show, yet to an extent where it almost feels like it's been dumbed down.\\n\\nNevertheless, i agree with the masses, this popular anime lives up to its reputation, and you really must see for yourself!\",\n",
       " 'This anime made my mouth open wide for longer than 5 seconds more than a handful times. This is the type of world where more people get killed than the entirety of the A Song of Ice and Fire series. It exists in a timeless universe – not in the past, present or future of our world, but in a pocket universe where Titans existed long before the existence of machines. In this world, machines were not invented to improve humanity’s lifestyle, but for the continuous existence of humanity itself. There’s lots of shouting (especially from Eren), lots of action, lots of character development, and lotsof tears. My friends weren’t kidding. I felt like my ear drums would break from all the intense shouting. I think my mind is forever scarred, what with how everyone got crushed like ants all the time. And my heart has become immune to all other fictional deaths, what with all the deaths I’ve experienced just from this show alone.\\n\\nIt teaches you a lot about what it takes to be a soldier, a survivor. Constantly, people have to be reminded to “FIGHT!” Some lines are repeated all over the anime that it kind of becomes engraved into your head and heart once you’re done with it.\\n\\nIt’s the kind of anime that sticks with you, the kind that leaves you with phantom faces with phantom voices following you around, making you feel as if you’re still living in that universe, even after you’ve told yourself that you’re done with it.\\n\\nThe concept of the villain, and of the world itself, is scary and genius. First off, the villain – the Titan – is basically a stupid giant human cannibal.\\n\\nUnlike other villains, it doesn’t want revenge. It doesn’t want world domination. It doesn’t want power. It doesn’t need to eat. It has lived a hundred years without eating humans. But it is all it ever eats. It doesn’t eat animals. It wants only one thing – and this is just a theory, but it’s one that I can side with, and one that I love the most – to annihilate the existence of humanity.\\n\\nSecond, the fact that it looks human. It is, in every aspect, a human being, except for the fact that it doesn’t have two things; sexual organs, and a conscience. Countless times, characters had their feet rooted to the ground, unable to fight, and I think it’s because the image of a gigantic human biting off a human’s neck is just too fascinatingly cruel that they feel they cannot look away.\\n\\nThe world itself is scarier than the world of the Hunger Games. And I think what makes it scary is the fact that humanity has never won against the Titans, ever. For the past who-knows-how-many-years, Titans have been eating humans.\\n\\nThe humans in this world pretend that they have a system.\\n\\no matter what plan the humans think of, no matter how determined every single one of their skilled soldiers are, they will still be crushed in less than a second without remorse, without even a body to prove that you have existed. This is their anarchy, their ‘chaos’.\\n\\nEvery single man, woman and child in this world lived with losing a loved one as a social norm. It’s a dark fact I’d like everyone to consider. Everyone is already dead, in everyone else’s eyes. That’s what’s sad about this whole thing – even the humans think of other humans as just tiny insects with no importance. But it’s also beautiful, because sometimes, sometimes a character sees through that corrupted notion and calls everyone else out on it, making us realize it along the way too.\\n\\nSo you have a dark world, and an even darker society. Combine that with real-life everyday problems like corruption in the system, hierarchy in social status, differences in privileges and human rights and what do you get? Awesome badass characters who naiively try to fight against it.\\n\\nThe differences in character personality is great, too. There are a few who are extremely righteous, but most of them just really don’t care. They feign an act of indifference, but all for different reasons. But the fact that they had grieved over the death of a loved one united them.\\n\\nAnd I think that’s brilliant. These clashes of personality, and this unity for one tragedy, has bonded them together, and changed them greatly. You get to see how much they have grown in a span of 5-7 years. That’s something I don’t usually see in anime.\\n\\nYou also get to witness the amazing 3D Maneuver Gear.\\n\\nThis made the whole world look kind of sci-fi, but also, kind of not. The 3D Maneuver Gears are as close as we can get to a ‘high tech’ fictional gadget in this world. Every other man made thing you see in the anime is pretty mundane. But the function of it makes the people actually fly. It’s a pretty brilliant concept, and I like how something as complicated as that is a seemingly-ordinary thing for them. Plus, it makes the animation really cool to watch. You gotta respect the amount of effort (and physics, I bet) put just to make sure each maneuver looks even just a little legit.\\n\\nThe music is amazing, too. There were some points where I gaped like a fish because “wHaT just happened omg” and the music dramatically intensified my feelings. So kudos to that! The animation was splendid, hands down. Especially, like I said, with the whole 3D Maneuver thing.']"

       " 'original_text': [\"It's a bit of an eerie experience giving my first 10 on MAL to this kind of slice-of-life anime, but I honestly couldn't do anything else – in its own category, A Place Further Than the Universe is an absolute masterclass and I couldn't find any real negatives about it. It provided way more than I've ever expected considering the premise and charmed me to no end. The characters are full of personality and charming, but above all, they constantly feel human. Especially the main girls themselves are flawed and troubled in relatable ways, but while the show has moments where it focuses on their personalstories, it never gets overly melodramatic or sappy. It always keeps the perfect balance between drama, humour and casual SoL moments, without for a moment losing its pace or trying too hard to get the viewer emotional. It's humane and genuine like few other shows ever came even close to being in my experience.\\n\\nThe series is also beautifully produced, with visuals, music and voice acting all being rock-solid. It's really important in this kind of story, as it is heavily reliant on the proper atmosphere and sense of adventure (which, btw, applies even to the first half of the show, dedicated pretty much exclusively to the four girls meeting each other and finding their way to join the Antarctic expedition together).\\n\\nIt's hard for me to fully express how much I fell in love with this show and how strongly I recommend giving it a chance. Even if slice of life anime normally isn't your thing, this is just such a wholesome and subtly emotional experience that it's hard for me to imagine a person that wouldn't enjoy it at least to some extent. Try it out, and I promise you won't regret it!\",\n",
       "  \"Oh god this show is impossibly difficult. On one hand, it was actually pretty badass. I mean the concept itself is something very appealing to many fans in general, and the manga was already quite well received. But then, once you actually watch the show, all the hype turns into...confusion. Well here it goes, Tokyo Ghoul: The show revolves around Kaneki Ken, an introvert who spends all his free time engrossed in literature. By the miraculous hands of the anime gods, he ends up on a date with Kana Hanaz- I mean Kamishiro Rize, a purple haired beauty with the same tastes as him regarding novels andbooks. A few plot points later, and our friend Kaneki turns into a ghoul. Now, ghouls are a huge problem in Japan. They essentially live off of eating humans, and they are hunted by various police investigators, known as “Doves,” who aim to end the ghoul threat once and for all. Now this sounds pretty interesting, and at some points during the show, it genuinely is. For a majority of the show, the issue between the ghouls and doves is a point of high contention, as well as the moral boundaries of the ghouls themselves. Other characters include Kirishima Touka, the other purple haired beauty (ha) that acts as Kaneki's superior in a way, and a varied secondary cast that is really not worth mentioning. This leads me into the main issue with the show.\\n\\nThe characterization and characters themselves are what drive this show to the ground. Honestly, nobody really gets fleshed out during the period of the show. 12 episodes is generally enough time for this to happen, but Tokyo Ghoul could not accomplish this at all. It force feeds emotional situations down our throats, expecting viewers to sympathize with whomever is having an issue during any particular episode. The problem is, no character is developed to the point where I'd care about them in the first place. Speaking on Kaneki a bit, his characterization is not particularly weak, however, the way the creators went about it was quite counter productive for a show of this type and length- it was not until very later on in the show did we see some real development for him, and by that point, its effectiveness was little at best.\\n\\nThe characters are not the only seemingly lost aspects of the show, as the direction the show wanted to head in was quite skewed. This is a common problem in anime: the show does not know where it wants to go. At one point it will focus on the Ghouls vs. Doves, then it will jump to deep character relations, etc. The problem is none of these individual parts are fleshed out enough for viewers to really understand motivations and enjoy anything. And the ending. It certainly came as a surprise. I have not read a lick of the manga, (which ironically ended the same day as the anime.) therefore, I have no basis of comparison. However, the ending of Tokyo Ghoul is the largest example the skewed directions I just mentioned. It came out of nowhere. Literally nowhere. Everything about the show changed instantly. To be honest, it would have been enjoyable if the show gave itself time to get to the point. However, it fails in this regard as well.\\n\\nAs a positive, the show for the most part, looks great. Ghoul forms are  uniquely designed, and overall quality is medium-high. The show is not consistently good looking however, as many have pointed out. Animation can also be a bit wonky, but for the most part, is solid. This may deter a bit visually, however compared to the story flop, it is quite minimal. Sound wise, the show performs quite well. The OP and ED are simply superb, the OP being one of my favorites for the Summer 2014 season. The BGM did its job well, especially during the final episodes of the show. The sound, and to a lesser extend, animation and art, are strong points for this show.\\n\\nFinishing Tokyo Ghoul, I really didn't know how to react. Honestly, I liken this show to Evangelion in many ways, for those of you who have seen it. However, this show fails on so many basic levels, that it simply does not deserve a solid score. However, if you do choose to watch regardless, it is highly recommended to wait for the BDS, as the show is quite censored in the visual department for blood and gore. I don't necessarily regret watching this show, but could it have been done better? Hell yes.\\n\\nHave fun.\",\n",
       "  'Kotonoha no Niwa is one of Shinkai Makoto\\'s work. To be honest, I haven\\'t watched any of his works as of now except for 5 Centimeters per Second, and because of that, my expectations for this short movie is quite high. \"Will my expectations be met or will I be disappointed?\", that\\'s the question I was asking myself during the times I was hesitating to watch. And the answer to that? Well, the very purpose of reviews is to answer such question in segments, so here we go. Story: Given its length which is 45 minutes, none can expect a very good story to come outof it nor a story that will keep you awake for the night, thinking and reminiscing its beauty, generally speaking. So is this movie part of the majority? Frankly, yes. The story is about this young boy named Takao meeting a woman whom he has no clue about - age, name, and position -  in a Japanese-style garden. The catch is, he only meets her during rainy morning days for some reason. Now, you\\'re gonna ask me \"is that it?\". Of course not, but telling more about of the plot will just ruin your enjoyment of the show. \\n\\nFor a huge chunk of the show (maybe around 20-30%?), the narration style is - silent. Yes, no dialogues and monologues. Body languages, shots of different places, and an awkward silence between two people created a mysterious calm atmosphere within me which monologues and dialogues can never give to me. \\n\\nThe structure of the story was just like I expected. It started calmly, with almost nothing happens, then the character development starts, and soon enough, you can probably see it approaching miles away, the drama kicks in. The resolution is quite short, but that is expected.\\n\\nTo summarize, there\\'s nothing too special about the story but it doesn\\'t mean that it is bad or better off not watching, it definitely surpasses many romantic shows out there by a hundred-fold.\\n\\nArt:\\n\\nIn this category, all that I can say is \"wow\". I\\'ll be rampaging and cursing my life if the art and animation isn\\'t good as it is. The character designs are definitely good and fitting for each character. The background art is really something. There were times that I actually paused for a moment to appreciate its beauty. It is so detailed and sharp. The animation is smooth and I can find no fault in it. If we\\'ll be talking about camera positioning and panning or whatever they call it, it is perfect. If you say otherwise after watching it, please tell me so I can consult my ophthalmologist.\\n\\nSound:\\n\\nPiano pieces, raindrops, silence - they are all placed in scenes where I see them most fitting. They brought the atmosphere the director wants us to feel. If it\\'s a calm one, he prepared us the sound of the raindrops on a normal rainy rain with the sound of the pedestrians walking and chattering. If it\\'s monologue and a dramatic event, a piano piece will be played with the right tempo and key for the right mood and time. And if it\\'s the very important conversation between our 2 main characters, the silence treatment is given. (well, sometimes there\\'s a music being played) The music pieces played are not top-notch or memorable, but the genius placement made up for its lack of musicality.\\n\\nThe voice actors have done a wonderful job in performing on their own respective characters. The emotions that should well from each character for the given scene are wonderfully brought out. Nothing feels too irritating or out of place. In fact, I can listen to them speaking all day long without losing my head.\\n\\nCharacters:\\n\\nAkizuki Takao, a 15 year olde highschool student and Yukino Yakari, a character that will be explored on the later parts of the movie, starts their relationship from being a \"seatmate\" in that little \"hut\" of theirs, to peers talking about their most random things to come to their minds, and to something everyone expected to happen in a romance genre. For 45 minutes, those transitions between their different relationship didn\\'t feel slow nor fast. It was right on track, and thinking about it now, I hope I can pull-off that kind of character development in the stories I\\'m writing. (If you want to read it, sorry, it\\'s written in my native language).\\n\\nAbout the characters themselves, Takao is not your average wimpy romance MC found in almost all romance anime. He actually had done something that I wouldn\\'t even dare to. He also has dreams of being a shoemaker which was followed consistently throughout the movie.\\nOn the other hand, Yakari is the mysterious one. The viewers and Takao\\'s only knowledge about her is that she\\'s older than him. She doesn\\'t talk about herself except for her confession about her skills in cooking. Don\\'t be disappointed about this, as her character will be widely explored during the later parts.\\n\\nOf course there are also side characters like Takao\\'s family and friends. Except for his 2 friends who became a plot device, none of these side characters are truly important and none of them are worth writing for.\\n\\nAll in all, my reason for writing such short descriptions about the characters is either because any further statements will ruin the show or I actually don\\'t have anything to say about them.\\n\\nEnjoyment:\\n\\nPersonally, I enjoyed it, but not that much. I was not awestruck-ed nor felt trolled. \\n\\nOverall: \\n\\nLove it or hate it. It didn\\'t met my expectations but I definitely didn\\'t regret watching it. If you are a fan of Shinkai Makoto, this is must watch obviously. But if you\\'re looking for something that will bawl your eyes and shatter your heart, please look for another one. The story is short, not complex. It is something that you\\'ll forget sooner or later.To be honest, it had left me a bit hanging in the end. I didn\\'t feel satisfied on the conclusion. It looked to me like nothing happened. As for the art, it is something that I will remember for ages and one day hope that this kind of art will be a regular standard for regular TV anime shows.',\n",
       "  '(spoilers) I didn’t like Isao Takahata’s The Tale of Princess Kaguya on a March midday of years past. In retrospection, maybe it was my degree of awakeness, eyes slouched and body sliding into the couch that was too comfortable for its own good. Or, it was my cerebrum not yet mature enough yet to be desensitized to the methodical pace and repetition of the derived folklore. Or a dozen other things. Whatever rationale I conjure, the obvious conclusion is that I was wrong. The film’s visuals might very well be why man picked up the pencil, but that almost doesn’t need to be said. While Isao Takahata’sfocus on the emptiness of the frame’s crevices has flocked a critical fawning over its nostalgic evocation, what stands out to me is the stillness of character, the moments of brevity, pondering, and composure, the wide frames, and the characters becoming one with their environment. \\n\\n\"Birds, bugs, beasts, grass, trees, flowers\\nBring spring and summer, fall and winter\"\\n\\nUnlike that Spring day, from the first few minutes, the film’s impression was overwhelming. The scene where Kaguya imitates a pair of frogs’ lunging, communication, and direction that initiated a path of familial deviation had such detail and distinguished movement. Her initial characterization as a curious, cheerful child was unlike any recollection I had perceived of the film prior. From the impressive form of her movement and care put into the lingering of each jolt of her legs formulate a fluidity that is difficult to overstate, it dawned upon me that I was experiencing something very different from the film I thought I had previously seen.\\n\\n\"Go round, come round, come round, O distant time\"\\n\\nFollowing the amphibian beyond the bamboo cottage let Kaguya walk; the outside world’s influence took hold on the untouched child, skin as pale as the land she had come from, eyes as black as her inevitable despair. As she found comfort in easing into familiarity with the town boys’ methods — the way they speak, move, engage with their surroundings, and find happiness within their means — that door was eternally shut by misplaced trepidations of nobility above and a misguided patriarch. The Bamboo Cutter, in order to show Kaguya the world’s splendorous range, halted the world’s influence on her; by showing her the world, he unknowingly took it away.\\n\\n\"Come round, call back my heart\"\\n\\nKaguya’s resistance to the dehumanization practices of a deeply rigid, intolerable expectation of female nobility is halted with the realization that any steps already taken were of no consequence. A ceremony predicated on her behalf, but not with her, and definitively not for her, a celebration without those whom she yearns to celebrate with, and a body questioning why she even ought to be celebrated. Despite placating her father’s wishes to an ability she thought was all she could muster, she recognizes that it was not enough. Despite her composure, the life she wanted to live is not only any longer attainable, but in compromise, there is but contempt. And she cracks.\\n\\n\"Come round, call back my heart\"\\n\\nThe subdued, pastel backdrops falter at this moment, representative of a thick, muck inner turmoil. The lines blur and thicken, palette shifts monochrome, pastel robes fall for the stark red garments, the moon domineers the frame until Kaguya returns to her place of influence and familiarity — the cottage is sold, mountain decayed, faces gone, and the passage of time irreversible. Then, she awakes, eyebrows plucked, teeth as her eyes, and what was once bursting personality full of life now splinters stoic. This stoicism wavers only when the shade of grief overcomes that of joy — the prospects of an arranged marriage, the emperor’s assault, and in the return to the City of the Moon.\\n\\n\"Teach me how to feel\"\\n\\nHow devastating it is to live as a piece of art. Kaguya, lauded in her piercing perfection and heart-wrenching deftness in all she put her mind to, never was an agent of her own happiness. Tied down and mouth shut like a statue, in disobedience came an erasing of the past like a colonialized relic, only to be held on with a tear. Whether her swan song with Sutemaru was really a dream or not, neither of them were willing to drop their obligations in such a manner as to realize a moment’s longing. When Kaguya says that she thinks she could have been happy with him, the implication is not that she wants to pursue that happiness, but recollect what could have been — a counterfactual of her own existence. The moon’s reach becomes clear, and Kaguya falls back down to earth.\\n\\n\"If I hear that you pine for me, I will return to you\"\\n\\nThe Tale of Princess Kaguya might be about living one’s life to the best of their ability, or finding solace in that you never will. Maybe it is more about reconciliation with death, as Takahata passed away but half a decade later, or recognizing the beauty in pain as reflective of how things were once better. While pointed, the takeaway of having compassion for parents’ misguided actions, reaffirming the fallibility of parental figures is one that keeps recurring in my head. Despite all The Bamboo Cutter had done, in the end, Kaguya found the love for him to precede all else. She might have been a princess in background and dignity — she frolicked in a world outside the bamboo cottage, frog in hand, had loved, yearned, and felt pain with a youthful intensity — if only he knew that she was much more than that.',\n",
       "  'Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is the second adaptation of the full metal alchemist manga. The show presents two brothers embarking a journey with a simple goal of recovering their limbs/body. In the world of Fullmetal Alchemist, a practice called alchemy is used to obtain something in exchange for something of equal value. Alchemy is very versatile in this sense as it used healing, fixing and even fighting. Fullmetal alchemist presents a very interesting and enjoyable unique story with each episode building up on one another. It is well paced and consistent with its overall goal. No episodes felt irrelevant to the plot which made every episodeworth watching. Its build up with each episode created a very satisfying ending with great twists and turns. It was unpredictable at times and had great action with the use of alchemy.\\n\\nThe characters in Fullmetal Alchemist are very likeable with each character having an ulterior motive. The interactions with the cast provided great entertainment and depth. Character development of the cast was top notch with lots of memorable moments. There are many antagonists in the show with each being labelled as one of the deadly sins. Each one managed to live up to their name having different personalities and motives. \\n\\nOverall, I was completely satisfied after watching Fullmetal alchemist Brotherhood. It provided a great coherent story with characters that were very memorable. It receives a high re-watch value and recommendation.',\n",
       "  'Oooh. This one isn\\'t going to be easy one. Hello everyone, ladies; gents; people; phantoms; espers etc. (see what I did there?) Welcome, to a new review. Now, usually when it comes to (my) reviews, I usually score the anime first before going straight into review to get a good enough idea of how exactly I should write it out. However, at the time of writing this review, I have no score I can give to Mob Psycho 100 because of one simple reason; I have no idea how to feel about this series. Let me explain. Plot: Mob Psycho 100 revolves around a young boy (apparently a 14year old child), Kageyama Shigeo (a.k.a \"Mob\"), who has psychic powers. Yes, when I say psychic powers I do indeed mean the bending spoon trick we all wanted to master at one point in our life. Ever since childhood, he was capable of bending spoons and lifting objects in the air. However, one day an accident occurred, which caused Mob to hide his powers and try to live a normal life as a normal kid. Along with his mentor, Reigen Arataka (who is a normal human being btw), Mob lives his life as a normal 8th grader and works alongside of Reigen to help him exorcise yokai because...you know, Reigen is pretty useless. That is, until Mob\\'s younger brother (Kageyama Ritsu), accidentally gets himself involved into some awful shit. \\n\\nOf course, the story is pretty straight forwards and can seem pretty bland to anyone who have seen animes with similar synopsis, however, there is just a bit more to that. By the time this review is up, Mob psycho 100 has ended, but there\\'s possibility that more will come. Let’s all hope that more WILL come or I’m sure we will all lose our minds. \\n\\nOriginal author of the comic (ONE), seems to have way more in store for us than the anime left us with (also I\\'m pretty sure the manga is still on-going but I don\\'t read mangas), making me believe that there is way more to this plot than what we were left with on episode 12.\\n\\nSee, this is where my problem begins; last time I\\'ve watched an anime like this (meaning it ended on a cliff-hanger), it left me with exactly same feeling as I felt for MP100 (that anime was Bungou stray dogs and S2 is already here to save us), it felt kinda rushed and unfinished, but at the same time it felt like the anime completed something. It’s like you\\'ve played a video game, won and had ability to go back to your normal routine before the action of the game started. Its looping back on itself but it’s rewarding at the same time, it gives you an idea that you\\'ve gone a long way and now it’s time for you to live your life like it was before, with a small changes or something like this.  \\nOf course, a lot of people will call this cheap and/or very unoriginal. I can see where these people would come from, as this seems like an awful ending to something that might’ve took them 6 episodes to really get into (which is a huge negative but I will get into that later), it doesn’t feel rewarding them and that is all ok. Not everyone is going to like this type of ending, it really is hard to like the anime after that, and makes you feel like you just wasted few hours (or maybe days) watching this anime only to have a middle finger thrown at you.\\nHowever, as much as I would like to say that I agree with these people, I cannot. Here’s why:\\nI personally  spent two days to finish this anime, getting up to episode 8, as soon realising that I was in love with it so much that it felt awful for it suddenly end on me. And I would like to underline that I went into this anime knowing I will love it yet my expectations were already low. The reason behind it is because of the fact that if the anime is highly hyped, it usually makes people who really aren\\'t hyped about feel like this anime is really just overrated. That’s basically how I felt when first starting this anime. \\nAt the very beginning of this whole thing, I literally sat and had stared at the screen before putting my hands on my face. I really didn’t want to watch it. So why did I watch it in the end? The plot honestly pulled me in, and I really didn\\'t except for it to do, and maybe this is why I cannot agree with people who said that it’s cheap and/or basic. MP100 gave me something I really needed for a while and that is a stable Anime Plot.\\nVisuals/sound track: \\nTo anyone who never watched One Punch man but watched Mob Psycho 100 (or vice versa), ONE is the author of the two animes/mangas. Of course, his style isn\\'t the best and it seems like an amateur work when looked by art critics, but ONE managed to create quite good webcomics. Of course, his style is still visible in the animes themselves, at times even looking exactly like ONE\\'s style, but of course with wonderful magical hands of Bones studios; we get a decent looking animes with a decent animation.\\nI’m going to be 100% honest though, the animation style reminded me so much of MADHOUSE that I almost said that this anime was created by MADHOUSE. Please forgive me Studio Bones, you make great animations but you and MADHOUSE really have similar styles in some cases //SOBBING.\\nOf course, when it comes to animation, at times it can get so smooth it doesn\\'t seem to fit the style itself, those occasions are rare however. It is very difficult to have a pleasing style and good animation to work with it, especially when the original style doesn\\'t exactly look like something you would see a professional animator do (I apologize for criticizing ONE so much, please don\\'t kill me, but he really does need to improve). \\n\\nOf course, I gave the art/animation a 6 out of 10 as it was pleasing to the eyes and managed to make my blood pump so hard I thought I\\'m gonna have a stroke. The animation was able to make my head hurt as so much adrenaline was running through it, and believe me when I say that not many animes are able to do that. Sure, there was some good action in Tokyo ghoul; attack on titan and FMA brotherhood (to name few popular ones), but I don\\'t think these were able to give me the same vibe as MP100 did.\\n\\nWhenever it comes to sound track, I usually rely on my bad music tastes to help me out, but so far I couldn\\'t listen to any of the tracks and let my music taste take over as some of the soundtrack sounded better than the other. And I\\'m saying this after hearing the OST in the anime itself (I really need to listen to real OST, don\\'t I?). Problem with me is that I hate to listen to OST outside of the anime as it seems out of place. Without characters talking or some sound effects breaking in to muffle the sound track, it just feels weird. It might just be, but it’s better for me to judge a soundtrack while its playing in the background as the anime goes, rather than listen to it separately. If I were to judge it however, I would say that OP; ED and OST were good. I wouldn\\'t have rated it otherwise- That is, really all I can say about this part.\\nCan we just say how the OP is literally by MOB CHOIR and it’s called “99”?\\nLike, only time this number is said is at the very end. \\nEh, whatever, the op is catchy enough to keep me glued to it even as I am writing this review.\\n//JAMS TO OP\\n\\nCharacters: \\n//BREATHES\\nTHIS ONE IS GONNA BE DIFFICULT.\\n\\nMob.\\nOmfw, I will sound like a worst fangirl ever, but I fucking love Mob. Like that episode WHEN HE WORE PINK HOODIE, HE LOOKED SO CUTE LIKE AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA! Also, he is like the cutest Cinnamon Roll that gets serious only when he wants to, and he’s been raised by a fucking faker to be a gentleman, HE DIDN\\'T WANTED TO FIGHT A WOMAN. Little baby needs hugs I swear to World. Oh, don’t piss him off though, he will fight you and fuck you up. Like, stay on his good side and hope to all that you love that his explosion meter didn\\'t hit 100% (or that he didn\\'t pass out on you, not even God will save your ass once he’s out). If I do this meme with 3 fictional characters being used as a description of me, I would totally use him. ALSO HE APPARENTLY HAS ANEMIA, I NEVER FELT LIKE I CAN RELATE TO A CHARACTER SO MUCH BEFORE!\\nMy heart is killing me, omfw. \\n//DEAD\\n\\nOk, Fangirl mode is off.\\n\\nOk I am 100% serious now, I did like seeing Mob being that naive little kid that forgives way too easily and follows his mentor like a lost puppy (I can\\'t, I just imagined this jfc Kira stay focused). And of course, I loved to see Dimple (Ekubo to those who didn\\'t have his name translated) trying to act all high and mighty when in reality he was weaker than me (that joke will never get old). But there were some problems with other main characters (at least with one of them), and that problem was that although there was some strong character interaction and improvement, there wasn\\'t much screen time for one main character. For those who already watched the show, I\\'m pretty sure you know who I\\'m on about.\\n\\nAnd as a person who usually bonds with characters within span of few episodes, it was hard for me to really like that character because of how little screen time he had. At times I even forgot he was a thing, and for those who are still scratching their heads as to who tf I\\'m on about, it’s Reigen. I\\'m talking Reigen. I do like the fact that he is voiced by the same VA who voiced Osomatsu….I like this trash of an anime. I can relate to them, because I am such huge trash myself. I like trash. \\nAlso, is it me, or does Sakurai mostly voices trashes? No? Only me? Ok.\\n\\nOf course, I loved how different the characters looked compared to the usual typical looking characters. The style gave them this unique look which usually doesn\\'t change much as their designs are flat and all, but in this case the art style really saved everything. Just to clarify something, I am not referring to the first \"villain\" or the rest of the villains; I\\'m mostly talking about our main characters and few background ones. Please don\\'t come at me with knives and guns, please, thank you.\\n\\nCan we just talk about how much time it took Ritsu to finally accept that this brotherly act wasn\\'t a fucking act? Like seriously dude, you feared him, ok, but you loved him too\\nStfu now.\\nGo bend some spoons or something.\\n\\nOk, I have to admit, Ritsu wasn\\'t (and still kinda isn\\'t) my favourite and I didn\\'t disliked him even though that he has good reasons to be jealous of his older brother and fear him (I mean, come on, DUDE CAN BEND SPOONS; YOU NEVER KNOW WHEN HE MIGHT SNAP AND BEND YOU LIKE A FUCKING SPOON), I guess I was just too overprotective over Mob. I will say this though, I\\'m glad he got some of his brain back that he lost. I\\'m really glad.\\n\\nFinal verdict:\\n\\nI\\'m pretty sure you all are waiting for me to shut up and just finally give this anime a score so you can go ahead and watch it. Well, like I said earlier, this is where my problem beings. I\\'ve said everything I needed to say about this anime, I even reviewed it as best I could, but I am still left with this awful feeling that Bungou stray dogs left me with (until my friend told me about season 2). I cannot exactly rate it as gives me a feeling that this anime isn\\'t even finished. Because it isn\\'t, and as a person who rarely reads mangas (I am planning on changing that though), I really cannot feel complete until I see season 2 of this bitch or maybe even a fucking season 3.\\n\\nBut, if you were to ask me: \"is this show even worth watching?” even with me feeling conflicted about the ending of it and whether or not I want to rate it 10 or 1, I would answer; go fucking watch it.\\nBecause it really is, worth watching. This anime is a piss take, but believe me when I say it’s a good piss take. That doesn\\'t sound right but it’s my review. I can say almost anything I want here as long as it stops you or encourages you to either read the manga or watch this anime. So go and fucking watch it, you can hate me later &lt;3\\n\\nI hope this review helped a least a little.\\n\\nThis is IKira-n\\nSigning out.',\n",
       "  'Ergo Proxy Many already said about its cyberpunk elements and such. I will say that in regards of Science Fiction, plot development, execution and characterization, this anime is a True Masterpiece! The very concept of why it all happened in the planet is a true concern some scientists have, about the methane hydrate layer and the possible consequences if it went volatile. Many power and fuel industries have already shown interest in extrating and using it to produce energy, as the tihng is really powerful...but one of its characteristics is its volaticity, and if by mistake a chain reaction was iniitated and the existing layer went into combustion...thelife on the planet would be decimated. Take a look about what exist about the matter. It is intersting.\\n\\nWell, thus it is based on solid science extrapolation. Then the story goes with really intellingent plot developments without loosing to pure psychological drama, as there is enough action woven in the series to satisfy any action lover without loosing the story to those action-oriented, boring plots.\\n\\nIt is intelligent and every episode lays another hit as to what is really happening...and in the end you finally discover everything, being presented to a really surprising truth, and a turn of events that is both pleasing and really surprising. \\n\\nThe nature of the Proxys is really explained, so the story is not left without a closure...but at the same time it ends in a cliffhanger, actually yelling that a sequel may be produced one day, though if that does not happen, the end is closure enough to the present story, leaving the rest for the imagination of the ones watching the series.\\n\\nThe whole concept was magistrally layered and the whole truth is only fully disclosed in the last episode, making the series grip you until the last minute, until the last, thrilling image, where in the last panel we have the realization that the end was possibly far from happening to that story.\\n\\nAbout art, needless to say, it is beautiful and well done, imparting an air of dreamlike reality to the characters, which is true given the truth behind the planet and everything happening there.\\n\\n\\nFantastic Science Fiction, artfully executed!\\n\\nI just hope they really go for a sequel on this, as we surelly know after the last image we see that things were not resolved with the truth revealed, but it was just beginning, especially remembering what Vincent saw when he first left Rondeau...\\n\\nRemember...there was a child there...son of an exiled...and that implied something crucial to the whole story and that was  not there without a reason...\\n\\nMasterpiece from beginning to the end',\n",
       "  '[6.0/10] _____________________________________________________________________________________________________ Starting reviews with a quote is often cheesy and forced, however, I figure i\\'d fall in line with the series if I do, so... \"Mama Mia!\" That was Jojo\\'s Bizarre Adventure\\'s first season and it was indeed bizarre and quite the adventure, with a sprawling cast of characters and two massive arcs that end up giving more than they take. What felt like a generic action shounen, which I am strictly not a fan of, ended up transitioning into something just a little bit more... bizarre. Perhaps not quick enough, though, but the end result here is undeniably fun. I think that\\'s the easiest way tocharacterize this series as a whole at the moment. Fun. It is a fun show. It has fun characters. It has wacky fun twists. \\n\\nThanks for reading!\\n\\nFun/10\\n\\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n[Presentation]\\n\\nJust joking! I wouldn\\'t be myself if I didn\\'t criticize everything and hate on things that are hardly even made for me. Onto the animation, or, as I could put it more accurately, the moments that are actually animated. In classic action shounen fashion, this series has the air of a slap-dash production. A lot of it feels rushed, as most anime does, and that shows the most in the animation quality. \\n\\nIt is sparingly good with a deeper pang of mediocrity to downright ugliness. That being said, it has some smart tactics up its sleeve to cover up said ugly animation with what can only be called \"signature Jojo-isms\", which is how i\\'ll be referring to them from now on. Signature Jojo-isms are the parts of the series that we, and to a certain extent, I, recognized immediately as unique to this product. The moments and artistic choices that I was aware of coming into the series because they span seemingly throughout all of culture. \\n\\nShoddy animation is hidden behind posing, rumbling text on screen, awesome use of color and ultimately an appealing visual style. I feel like a series like this can actually be consumed frame-by-frame and the end result wouldn\\'t actually be any worse than what we have here. The animation feels like a transition from one pose to another, rather than just something fluidly paced. If anything, it is a clever use of budget. It feels natural to have these characters move less when they\\'re so focused around standing still and looking good. This isn\\'t me excusing the poor animation in some areas, but it is me complementing the series in understanding its strengths and not trying to amend impossible weaknesses. This is undoubtedly the smart way to go about presenting a series. \\n\\nThe sound is also standout. What effort and time they didn\\'t have for the animation they clearly outsourced well for the sound. Both the music and the sound effects have a great cheese to them that really brings the series to life. The opening to the second arc is a total ear-worm that I don\\'t see myself forgetting anytime soon. But this design goes past just sound-effects and the opening, the backing music even has personality to it. Each character ends up having a somewhat memorable theme. In the shows superior second arc, we get plenty of recognizable stingers and bombastic techno-anthems that seriously pound your eardrums in the best possible way.\\n\\nFrom the Pillar Men to our favorite Nazi, everyone gets a time to shine, musically. Once again, I feel like this show could\\'ve easily been consumed in some kind of less movement focused visual medium, like a Visual Novel. Especially since it is so focused around the music. What you\\'d be losing, however, is the grandiose voice acting. Don\\'t get me wrong, everything here is over-acted to shit but I think that\\'s how it was meant to be. It is all silly, and the actors are clearly having a hoot yelling just about every line they read. \\n\\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n[Characters &amp; Story] \\n\\nThe series really ramps up in quality as it progresses, not necessarily in the art department but in the overall enjoyment of what is transpiring in front of you. We start with a mildly generic battle-arc that has sparring moments of entertainment mixed in with a jambalaya of boring nothingness. The first arc really leaves a lot to be desired. Both the settings and our protagonist feel incredibly weak in comparison to the second arc, where the series really decides to take off. \\n\\nWhen we meet the second JoJo, Joseph, you end up seeing exactly what direction this show is going and understanding exactly why this is positive. It went from a slightly wacky battle Shounen to an off-the-wall batshit insane battle Shounen, and honestly, I wouldn\\'t have it any other way. I find that most battle shounen in anime tend to go down the same path and I rather not harp on the entire genres problems this review since I do that so often in my other outings. All that needs to be said is that JoJo is bizarre enough to stand out from the already bizarre selection of battle shounen that end up getting mushed together into one lump of over-moralizing strung-out garbage. \\n\\nOf course we get plenty of the cliches that come with the genre, though. From the over-abundance of still images with a few action lines thrown in to training arcs and jobbing that act like the cherry on top of the action shounen pudding. We have side-characters that do nothing but gawk at the action, and the general illogic of battle, where every moment feels like decades and characters just stand around chatting and explaining rather than actually fighting. We also have one of my least favorite cliches, as a character watches their friends get decimated before doing something, instead of helping them right away. Because of course they have to monologue and let the story unfold as dramatically as possible. For example, Joseph battles one of the three main baddies in this chariot race. Joseph cheats by piling rocks at the starting line and makes the baddies chariot unable to begin the race, while he flies by. Moments later, however, it is revealed that the baddy actually wanted this to happen and needed to be behind Jojo all-along. Yet his reaction to the initial rock pile-up, even when Joseph was hundreds of meters ahead of him, was that of shock. Why? Who was he playing to? The viewers? \\n\\nThese are issues that even Jojo can\\'t overcome. That being said, what it does within this genre it does well. The villains were both memorable and the unfolding battles, during their peaks, were solid. Even if the barrage of episodes leading up to the final climax, or what I call \"battle build-up\", where the characters fight through seeming gauntlets of nothingness is just tedious to sit through. What\\'s great about Jojo is that it does its best to even make those moments funny, and I think at its best, Jojo\\'s is hilarious. \\n\\nAs something that can be defined as the pulpiest possible anime, which is already an insane sentence to write since most anime is pulpy. Jojo\\'s embraces that title and really runs the miles with it. You have man-eating squirrels, bubble-blowing Italian men, and every character death, major or not, treated as the worlds greatest tragedy. It is so unabashedly corny that you can\\'t help but laugh. And maybe that\\'s not the emotion I should be feeling during the sad moments, but the fact that the show so willingly plays every one of these bizarre and silly scenes as totally straight makes it so endearing and comical. \\n\\nThere really isn\\'t much to analyze here, though. The thematic elements are blunt and childish, as they are supposed to be. Every piece of symbolism is so hammy and funny that it really doesn\\'t hold any weight. But it really shouldn\\'t in a series like this. You should understand exactly what kind of show this is and revel in the mawkish glory. \\n\\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n[Conclusion]\\n\\nWhat I can\\'t help but think about is how this series does just about everything a parody should do, yet can\\'t really be classified as a parody. Everything is definitely exaggerated, but I wouldn\\'t even say it was deliberately exaggerated for comedy. The author, I feel, just wanted to make something bizarre and indulge in that quality. Comparing it to something like an earlier series I ended up dropping, Food Wars, the differences are palpable. Food Wars can be classified as a parody of action shounen, yet it was both less funny and less creative than Jojo. It was even less bizarre! A parody is supposed to over-exaggerated elements, but when non-parodies like Jojo\\'s are already so absurd I can\\'t help but feel like this entire genre is beyond parody at this point. \\n\\nWhich is interesting. Maybe I just haven\\'t thought of a proper approach to parodying a genre that already comes off as way over-the-top. Maybe Jojo\\'s really is a parody of sorts. But it plays like the kind of B-movie you end up really attached to because of how seriously it commits to the role of being that crappy B-movie. At the end of the day, that\\'s all you can really ask for. A fun, campy series that embraces the cliches of its brethren with enough vigor and prowess that you end up with a product that not only exceeds your expectations, but completely surpasses them, for the most part.\\n\\nStill weighed down by the genre trappings, much like any above-average Shounen action series that I\\'ve seen, Jojo\\'s crafts its own visual style and personal identity, while also  wearing its faults and scars like a cloak. Don the mask, become a supreme being, indulge in the inanity. Get in on the campy fun.',\n",
       "  'To Quote Mark Watney in The Martian \"I\\'m going to have to science the sh*t out of this.\" That one sentence, is Dr. Stone. Before I go any further I want to stress that the idea itself is interesting. Something happened throwing the whole world back into the stone age and then protagonist-kun arrives to save everyone with SCIENCE! Fine, Sounds like a great idea for a children\\'s educational show.... but this is clearly not meant for kids though. If anything it\\'s more of a twist on the isekai genre with the OP main character complete with a cast that does nothing but play cheerleader to him. Thisis where the show has a problem. Science is used as a catch all phrase for everything from chemistry to medicine to rocket science to astrology. It\\'s all \"science\" everything is \"science\" and since Senkuu maxed his \"science\" skill then he is obviously at PHD level in all of them... at highschool... sure.\\n\\nThe characters here are beyond weak. They\\'re so one-note it actually hurts. Tsukasa is set up as the bad guy early on with so many flags they might as well be in an airport runway. Kids shows respect their viewers more than this. \\n\\nArt is stylized enough for a few character designs to stand out but that\\'s about it. \\n\\nOverall this show is sorta empty and feels like it doesn\\'t have anything to say beyond \"Science is cool yo\" which... is sorta lame.  it\\'s not a bad show though, just.... meh...',\n",
       "  'Parasyte was a good anime, the changes in Shinichi was huge when he got stabbed in the heart which made him almost emotionless. The fights between a parasyte and him was good too. What made me sadden was Kana, I think she deserve to be with Shinichi, Why i preferred Kana and Satomi was that Kana was kind of unique to be hearing wavelength which only a parasyte could, that was one special trait she had, while satomi was just one of your typical ordinary high school girl, being shy yeah. I don\\'t hate her though, I just preferred kana. Kana was quite obsessed withShinichi, as far as plucking his hair and curl it to represent a ring and put it into the ring finger. And dreaming too. Kana first met shinichi when he got bullied by Kana and her gang. Kana told them to stop bullying and wanted to help him up, but sensing his right hand was weird, which made Kana curious and all the romance and stuff came up as kana became a \"stalker\".\\n\\nThe interesting part was when Shinichi became badass, after reviving from death by Migi. As shinichi became kind of strong, having part of some power from Migi, Migi really helped Shinichi a lot, but after gaining some of Migi\\'s power they co -operate and defeated Parasytes.\\n\\nMigi was a cute character, the voice was cute, what I like about Migi was that he was quite strong, protecting shinichi, and through out all he has experienced with Shinichi, they kind of became friend, and Migi seems a bit more understanding Humans and more of having compassion.\\n\\nThe story itself was okay, the plot was okay too as we see changes in Shinichi, Art was good, Sound was Amazing, especially Migi. Character development was kind of good as we could see changes. Enjoyment was definetely Fantsastic, I enjoyed a lot. Overall it was nice to see the anime.\\n\\nNow to the ending of Parasyte, it was kind of confusing because the parasyte was gone and i was wondering where did they went. Migi disappeared, I would miss him, as Satomi and Shinichi live happy ever after, after some epic event happening. Where did migi went too, I meant he was in Shinichi body, its not like he would go anywhere else. Will miss migi. :( Kana too.',\n",
       "  'This review will no doubt be consumed in my personal bias and favors, but I can clearly state that \"I love Noragami.\" I watched the whole series within a night never losing interest in every single moment. Noragami I\\'d say is a combination of the action, slice-of-life, and super natural genres. One they I\\'d like to say is that though action is not a main focus what so ever, its so beautifully animated and executed that its a reason alone to watch Noragami. 7/10 The plot of Noragami is not at all driven. In a sense there really is no story but moreof a foundation for the premise of Noragami\\'s world and for the characters.  Yes it is fairly exciting and extremely interesting but the simple fact is, nothing\\'s really happening in terms of a story, but rather in terms of character development and setting.\\n\\n10/10\\nThe animation is beautiful and probably one of Bones\\' best works in terms of graphical fidelity.  It\\'s overall done really well and gives life to every Character\\'s expressions, movements, and how they interact with the world.  Definitely a selling point for Noragami.\\n\\n10/10\\nNoragami does not skimp out on music at all.  Not only is the opening frustratingly addicting but the soundtrack has a lot of unique style (that reminds me a lot of Persona at some points) and accompanies every event wonderfully.\\n\\n10/10\\nCharacters is definitely a strong aspect.  Not only is every character unique and loveable, but they\\'re all characters you can relate to.  Noragami\\'s presents many underlying themes than tie in to real world struggles whether it be isolation or escaping one\\'s past.  Characters are extremely funny for comic relief, but they are so many layers to them underneath.  The complexity of the characters is central to the course of the Anime.\\n\\n10/10\\nI enjoyed everything about Noragami.  It made me laugh, cry, and filled with awe and excitement.  Noragami is just a plethora of the feels and good times.\\n\\nI would definitely recommend that anyone that is an enthusiast for anime, even if you\\'re of the pure shounen race, to check out this anime.  Watch it and decide for yourself how good it is, outlying my personal bias.',\n",
       "  \"Cowboy Bebop... widely considered as a masterpiece. I personally thought it was good, but I would have trouble placing it at masterpiece status. I decided to watch Cowboy Bebop because it was done by Shinichiro Watanabe, who also did Samurai Champloo, which is one of my all time favorites. If you watched Champloo, Bebop is similar in that both follow an episodic format, where there is some kind of a story or plot, but the story itself is not as important as the journey. In Champloo, this was the search for the sunflower samurai. I guess in Bebop the main plot focus could be considered Spikesbackstory and the whole situation with Julia.\\n\\nCowboy Bebop is about bounty hunters Spike and Jet and there adventures as bounty hunters and the other bounty hunters, Faye and Edward who they meet along their journey.\\n\\nStory 8/10\\n\\nArt 8/10\\n\\nSound 8/10\\n\\nCharacters 9/10\\n\\nI think the most interesting part of Cowboy Bebop is I guess the main protagonist, Spike Spiegel. Although I do not necessarily the episodic format to be a bad thing, I feel that it sometimes took away what was the most interesting part of the show, which for me was Spike's backstory. Spike is a very interesting character - he is very mysterious, not to mention that he is very skilled at his job.\\n\\nEnjoyment 8/10\\n\\nOverall 8/10\\n\\nHad some moments which where interesting/entertaining, however I have trouble recommending Cowboy Bebop as a masterpiece as some people do.

       "  \"Noragami. What a stellar season it has been. After watching 12 episodes of this mindblowing anime, i can say it is one of the best of 2014 Winter anime. At first, when you read the synopsis, you would probably think this. Yea, its one those demon or phantom/ god anime where they try to kill each other or this anime seems almost like a copy of Soul Eater. Well, Noragami takes that idea and throws it in the trash. Noragami's plot is very intriguing and really interested me.Being a huge fan a supernatural or superpower animes, Norgami gives everything a superpower anime fan wants. Tons ofaction balanced with funny and serious moments.  Not only do they pace the anime very well (considering that this is a 12 ep anime) they also balance out the romance and comedy to the point where one does not completely overwhelm each other.If you are looking for a very well placed and interesting plot, then give this anime a shot.\\n\\nAs for artwork, i can say that Noragami had superb artwork. Of course, being in the 2014 season, its not a surprise. But I can say that i really enjoyed the fight scenes being animated, especially towards the end. Each episode had no drop in the quality of animation and art is one of the strongest departments in this anime. As for sound, theres not really much to tell besides the fact that they had awesome OP and ED along with excellent voice acting.\\n\\nAs for character, i believe this is the best, if not, the ultimate reason why Noragami lives up to its potential. Each character is very likable with thier own special personalities. I'm actually impressed with the writers because they managed to dish out character transformation in such a little amount of episodes. For example, without trying to reveal spoilers, each character had some sort of insecurity or past that they did not like, but then thanks to friends, they overcome these insecurities and learn from them. \\n\\nOverall, I really enjoyed Norgami as whole. Its satisfied everything that I enjoy watching as an average anime watching lover. If you enjoyed reading this review, give a thumbs up and feedback is always appreciated!\",\n",
       "  \"Rating: 8-9 Overall: Finished Soul eater about a week ago. Loved the overall concept and the artwork. Although the ending left me wanting more. I just felt that the anime could have done more with the story. Story: The development of the story proceeds pretty well with the exceptions of the excalibur episodes.(after the 2nd one, I got pretty sick of that guy)If you read the manga(which is pretty good right now), you notice the anime stays true for awhile and eventually darts off and does its own thing, the ending really threw me for a loop. \\n\\nFrom the way I see it, the manga is taking soul eater to its true potential. So if you love the anime give the manga a go. I think the story starts darting off around episode 38 if you don't wanna start from the beginning start there. \\n \\nBut the story in the anime wasn't bad, but like I said It left me wanting more and who knows if this is gonna have a 2nd season.(I hope so)\\n\\nPeople have been saying its a typical anime with good vs bad or whatever, but looking past that, this anime is pretty damn unique. There are things to be discovered, you just have to watch. ^_^\\n\\nAnimation/Art:\\nThe artwork has good texture and is unique.  The animation is very smooth. \\n\\nThe animators did not get lazy at all. From beginning to end. The animation and artwork is top notch.  \\n\\nSound:\\nNot too picky about it, I didn't notice anything bad. \\n\\nEnjoyment:\\nEven though the anime darts off and does its own thing. I still enjoyed this anime ALOT, because of the fluidity of the animation, the cleanliness of the art, and I thought the voice actors did an awesome job. \\nWhen Maka yelled, it pierced my soul, a  powerful performance in my opinion.    \\n\\nConclusion: \\n-If you're looking for lovely action scenes that will blow your mind. Watch it\\n\\n-Looking for unique artwork and characters. Watch it \\n\\nand it's not a serious anime, so expect a few laughs. ^_^\",\n",
       "  \"Assassins; just hearing this word makes anyone thinks of nothing expect evildoers whom kills people in shadows (some may say a cowardice way of killing), but this anime wants to give the viewers another way to understand the assassins and presents them as justice delivers.

To the real business; about the story:well, I bet anyone who watched this anime to the end would be really dissatisfied and irritated with the story line, the pacing was really fast and they were many unreasonable and vague things in the last episodes, the plot was messed up from the end of Kyoroch arc, this is an anime review so I will not bring up anything from the manga (since I follow the manga of this story too) but still…story 4\\\\10.\\n\\nArt: the art was good, especially at some fighting scenes the animation was really good, characters' designs were fine , the view of the city and the empire was also good, but in the end I don't find anything really special about it so my rate for the art 7.5\\\\10.\\n\\nSound: they were good, I really liked the 1st ED theme, the voice actors\\\\actress performance was very good. not really expert with this stuff but my rate for the sound 7\\\\10.\\n\\nCharacter: shortly;lack development, what strange is that the anime was named clearly for (Akame) but she did get less scene action than the other main character (Tatsumi), I know about the ending but when we talk about it throughout the whole story then I think it was better if they named it (Tatsumi ga Kill)...well just kidding, about the villains; some of them were really stupid who play with people lives like toys so you can't do anything but hate them, even though the main antagonists were different at least.

       "  'Madoka Magica- an extremely popular, well loved, and held up by many as a landmark in the magical girl genre. A show that many describe as having beautiful artwork, a fantastic soundtrack, and contains one of the most exciting and unexpected stories in anime of late. Is Madoka Magica all of these things? Yes, and no. Let’s find out what it is that works and doesn’t. Note that I will try my best to avoid spoilers- but for my analysis of the plot, there may be one element that could be considered a minor spoiler. Beginning with the Artwork and Animation: Madoka definitely lives upto its reputation of having unique artwork. The trippy witch labyrinth sequences are, in a word, psychedelic. Imagine, if you will- a mixture of Salvador Dali’s Dadaism mixed with Picasso, all in a very surreal, vibrantly colorful atmosphere. As for the character artwork and backdrops, Madoka is fairly average- with quite a few moments of very low detail in the characters, and a number of still frames used to conserve the budget. For the use of the surrealist art alone, this anime earns a place among the visually striking, but is dragged down at times by the standard animation. \\n\\nThe show succeeds to a much greater degree on the Sound and Voice Acting front, however. I watched it in both languages, and both are equally watchable. There are no real virtuoso performances in this, but it’s handled very competently. The soundtrack, on the other hand, is very good. Opening and ending songs aside, the background music is really something- with everything from dark, grinding industrial music to classical violin to medieval chant to soft piano instrumentals to introspective and dramatic orchestral pieces, and even a few rock pieces, too. I’m no Yuki Kajiura fan by any means, but this is decidedly one of her best works. The soundtrack is very effective in tense and dramatic moments, as well as it is in emotive and introspective ones. If nothing else good can be said about Madoka Magica- the music is really something. \\n\\n\\nAlso, what is this, “Survivor’s Guilt: The Anime”? \\n\\nThe idea behind the show is that these girls who are given magical powers are granted one single wish in exchange for their soul and servitude, in order to eradicate these entities of curses and malice known as witches. If offered a single wish in exchange for one’s soul, does it not occur to the person that they should perhaps ask for more? The wishes are often very poorly thought out, especially in foresight and scope. There was no stipulation that “more wishes” was against the rules. This isn’t Aladdin’s genie, who laid the rules down up front before any wish could be asked. \\n\\nThe wishes are also extremely shallow and selfish, especially considering that they’re offered “literally anything” by the wish granter, with the guarantee that it would come true. Their wishes are the equivalent of wishing for a car, when they could just be given an entire factory that can produce any car, or other vehicle for that matter, and an unlimited number of resources with which to supply it. The wishes are similarly short sighted and fruitless overall. It’s not necessarily true to say that the characters are stupid- because they really aren’t. Madoka describes herself as being very average and “not particularly smart, beautiful, or talented”, and she’s exactly this: average. This show examines a group of otherwise absolutely average individuals given otherworldly powers. They don’t conform to normative anime color coded hair and character archetype tropes- which was refreshing, but at the same time, being that the characters were more grounded, they were also pretty predictable in their decisions. This, I think was used to good effect in a sort of “don’t do it!”, and “this can’t end well” type of way for the viewer, but inevitably you know that they’re going to do it anyway. Perhaps this adds a more tragic element to it for the viewer, but for me it was mostly frustrating to watch characters make stupid decisions that were obviously not given much thought to.\\n\\nOften in anime or film, we have characters who are defined by one trait- such as Suzaku Kururugi from Code Geass being the embodiment of a lawful good rule follower. He exists for no other purpose than to uphold the rules. Or, we have a one note harem girl who is an animate &lt;insert prefix&gt;-dere archetype. Similarly, the characters in Madoka Magica who have the most screentime have the least depth and are least thought out. I think it’s because these other, lesser characters weren’t given as much exposition, but were given very cut and dried motivations for making their choices (and wishes). It’s not enough to say that their “wish” becomes the essence of their being, but even before they act out on said wish, their character is held back by this shallow, small scale goal. Perhaps they were designed to be that way- average, small minded people who don’t think ahead, but I see it as an oversight in character development- where they don’t consider that, when given an opportunity, they should concern themselves with all avenues that it may lead to. This was the focal point of the first four episodes or so- and I applaud the show for having the characters take time and reflect on their decisions (or lack thereof), but ultimately this is pointless, because they’re either conned into or make the same decision they were struggling make to begin with, even when faced with the gravity of making said decision. \\n\\nFurthering this point, Homura’s motivations are poor, to say the least. Dio Brando wanted to enslave the world because his dad was a jerk to him as a child. That’s a bad motive. Many shows revolve around a concept of friendship and the ties that bind, but this show takes this to a bit of an unbelievable degree- while still borrowing concepts from a much more tightly run series. If faced with a traumatic event involving a friend, and then given the decision to redo that part of my life, potentially with a different outcome, while my friends and family lose recollection of said event, VS allowing the event to happen or just taking myself out of the equation and observing whether it played out differently, I would choose the latter. If presented the trolley problem, and I had to kill an animal in order to eat it and survive or whatnot, it’s a non-decision to make- but one that’s turned into a needlessly wrestled-with problem in this show- ESPECIALLY when combined with the wishes.\\n\\nThis show also highlights very strongly why time travel is like taking a shotgun to the plot. Not only does it create a series of very questionable events and choices (and holes), but also opens up the story to “well, if this character can go back in time, why didn’t they just go back to X event that leads to Y consequence?” issues. Again, this topic was handled better in a pair of other, similar shows that were much less loose with their rules of time manipulation and the consequences thereof. I found myself asking “if this character can go back in time, why is it that they don’t just go back and stop the birth of the antagonist that plagues them?” Or “why doesn’t this character go back in time and kill X person?” This would create another paradox on top of the one that already exists in a time manipulation series- but, when a series plays loosely with its internal consistency and logic without a particular explanation of the limitations or grounds by which the time travel is made possible- then ergo, anything should be possible, right? This would have wrapped the plot up in a pretty pink bow (pun intended), with just a few words and actions by certain characters, but by virtue of “that’s not how the show was written”- it wasn’t. \\n\\nOne other thing that needs to be addressed, though, is this false claim that Madoka Magica is a deconstruction of the Magical Girl genre. Perhaps my own understanding of what “deconstruction” in a literary use is, but my understanding is that it takes some established trope, idea, archetype, etc and draws attention to it- specifically how it works in a more “realized” setting vs the “idealized”. For example: In School Days, this is taking the idea of a harem, and then showing how playing a bunch of girls off on each other is probably a bad idea, and that Japanese schoolgirls aren’t all necessarily polyamorous/okay with sharing partners as many ecchi/school/harem shows would have us believe. I do see that as a “deconstruction”. A literal taking apart of the trope. Things like parodies aren’t deconstructions, but are subversions- which I think many conflate the meanings of. A subversion is something that you “expect”, but doesn’t happen in the expected manner. \\n\\nNow that I’ve established a baseline definition of a subversion vs a deconstruction, here’s how it applies to Madoka Magica: Madoka (the character) has a horrible inability to make decisions for herself. Even the title of the show is a bit misleading in this instance, also similarly to Code Geass- and those who’ve seen the show know exactly why. Because you know based on the title alone “Mahou Shoujo” or “Puella Magi”, this show is going to be about some girl who uses magic. Duh. The girl with the dream of being a Magical Girl is offered the chance, but fails to make a decision. That would be a deconstruction- rendering the “Magical Girl” element of the show meaningless. However, if she were to find out that being a Magical Girl is not exactly what she expected, or that it’s not something to necessarily strive for, or not even a good thing at all; then these are all subversions to the Magical Girl trope. Where the Magical Girl is typically painted as a little girl wearing a fancy dress and running around with a cutesy, stuffed animal looking mascot fighting some generic Machiavellian evil in a lighthearted manner, the subversion to this paints these all in a different light- which is exactly what Madoka Magica does. \\n\\nThe ending also left a bit to be desired- but was also fairly satisfying given the nihilistic feel the story had leading up to the conclusion. However, it felt like they were trying to outdo Gurren Lagann and End of Evangelion at the same time, especially in terms of scope and scale. There’s such a thing as “too much”, and I think Madoka came very close to going over. I can’t say I hated Madoka- far from it, really. As a show, it hits some of the right notes- and there’s a blessing and breath of fresh air in the complete absence of fanservice, but as a whole, it really just failed to leave a lasting impression.\\nEinstein once said that “insanity was doing the same thing over and over again, expecting different results.” Madoka Magica embodies this definition with a capital I. It was a different ride; certainly not what I’ve come to expect from a magical girl series, but ultimately has some serious holes in the universe and the logic stemming from twists that leave me a bit ambivalent about how much magic there really is in Madoka.',\n",
       "  'This anime was a mixed bag for me personaly and i will tell why short and easy. The art, backgrounds and most of the characters are great fun, but. The story is dull and the development for the main character Haruhi is poor to none. Ive never seen such a boring character before. She rarely show anny emotion and is neutral too pretty much everything happening around her. What keeps you watching is the other main characters cause they are great fun to watch, specialy the twins and Tamaki.',\n",
       "  \"Slight spoilers Dr.Stone is alright. When reading the synopsis of Dr.Stone I was pretty hyped. As post-apocalyptic stories are my favorite kind of story. However when watching it I was let down. Even though the premise was amazing the execution was silly and poor with many plot deceives. However it was still enjoyable to watch and watching Senku rise up his city of science was satisfying. One of the things I don't like with this show are the characters. I mean I like Senku a little but none of the characters honestly stick out or make any real impression. There all the extremes of their tropesand for most of the show everyone is just screaming. They are all kinda fun to watch but after the show ends there all just forgettable and hard to remember who they are. I will say watching the villages growth from not believing in science to loving it and that transformation was really nice. There were some good heartwarming moments which were sweet and that was one of the things I liked about the show. With the show having this silly vibe to it never had any moments were I was scared or worried about what was going to happen to the characters. You know nothing bad will happen so even the dangerous situations make you feel like nothing serious will happen and Senku will just save the day like he always does. With no real danger you can't get excited or feel anything during the dangerous parts. Like when Senku and that Magma feel into that whole during the cave expedition, we all know nothing serious was ever gonna happen. So it just makes the show less interesting overall.\\n\\nHowever, I can't find myself loving the show. It really is just the dumb stuff that happens that as a kid I wouldn't even notice or mind but when thinking of them just bothers me. For example during the tournament, when Chrome had to keep completely still to have the water not move to burn blond muscle man and put his clothes on fire bugged me because in Senku's words that is 10,000,000% impossible and especially in that scenario. I would list a few more but then it'll just sound like me just being a petty bitch so I will refrain. \\n\\nThere was also no character development throughout the series, sure the villagers turned to like science but that's not character growth, same with Chrome the only thing that changed with him was him calling himself a sorcerer user to a science user, because of this I couldn't become immersed or generally love the characters. Sure they were kinda fun to watch at the start but as the story goes and they become less interesting and just bland. \\n\\nThe music is honestly good and I love to listen to the OP and ED on youtube. There just perfect songs to jam to, the inset songs though are alright, there were a few I liked but the rest I completely forget after it ended. The animation was alright, a lot of moving panels during the action scenes with very little fluid movement but it was awful and it got the job done, and the character designs were okay, the only good one was Senku. \\n\\nOverall a pretty fun show to watch but nothing to fantastic that leaves an impression on me. It had it's good moments and it's not so good moments, it's silly moments and heartwarming moments, and I will say I'm a little excited for Season 2 where we will be getting a war arc, because who doesn't like a war arc. However I doubt anything serious will happen.\",\n",
       "  \"Don't play games! I know you're reading! That's right, freak. It behooves you nothing to ignore me. Take a good look. Quaff deeply from the trough of future shock. Allow that wooly brain to be stricken with envy. You're reading a work from Critic Member 001, anime lover, evil genius, and mad reviewer extraordinaire. 'Tis I... well, I'll think of an alias later. But for now... Steins;Gate. Seriously. Read. Adapted from a 5pb and Nitro+ visual novel of the same name, Steins;Gate was directed by Hiroshi Hamasaki and Takuya Satou, scripted by Toshizou Nemoto and Jukki Hanada, and produced by White Fox, responsible for other worksas Jormungund, Katanagatari, and The Devil is a Part-Timer! Original and anime character designs were drawn up by Ryohei Fuke, otherwise known as huke, and Kyuuta Sakai, respectively. It's another day at the Future Gadgets Lab. Mad Scientist Extraordinaire Okabe Rintarou, otherwise known by his nom de plume Okarin and his in-character nickname Hououin Kyouma, Resident Hack and Cosplayer, Future Gadget #8 (Real Name TBA) and several nuked bananas later, we have Mad Scientist and Hack bickering in their university elevator about text messages and perceived anomalies, events that our main protagonist know occurred, yet, according to Hack, haven't happened. And then Genius Girl Makise Kurisu, a person he could have swore he witnessed dead in a pool of blood, alive or undead. In terms of visuals, White Fox seemed to opt for copious amounts of glare from whatever light source is present juxtaposed by duller tones, darker shades, and shadows to accentuate that uncanny feeling that something's off. This in contrast to other scenes utilizing a slightly richer palette to suck the watcher to be absorbed in the frivolity or sensitivity of the moment. \\n\\nBarring the hook of Episode 1's ending, the show's 1st half is a slow build, a build that's an obvious detriment to those expecting an immediate climax into the action. When the shit finally hits the fan in the 2nd half and those who previously criticized the 2nd half's predecessor gets their long sought for release, I speculated whether or not that release would have felt more pleasurable had it come sooner. Would it? Yes, this is all one extended sexual innuendo, and no, it wouldn't. Whether one is conscious of the fact or not, without the 1st half, we would not have felt as strongly about what the cast goes through in the 2nd half. We wouldn't have gotten the opportunity to know the characters behind their stereotypes we put them up to and the facades they disguise themselves under, most poignantly so with Okabe and Makise. We wouldn't have a reason apart from the superficial to connect with them, and the time this characterization occurs allows these connections to happen organically, from moment to moment, rather than through one exhaustive exposition dump. And while messing with the fabric of time is the order of the day, this show also hosts one of the best examples of romance done right. No gimmicky external flirtations or forced internal confessions. Just shared, witty, and sincere moments that are natural extensions of their characters that, before you and they know it, culminate into something intimate, making the next few scenes after this intimacy is realized heartwrenching. This is not to say nothing significant to the plot progresses during this time, because all the while these moments occur, an oppressive atmosphere grows and expands, elucidating this, once again, uncanny feeling. And then a sound of thunder, or silence, or the thunder of one's heart, that dreadful moment you, in the back of your mind, were expecting, that's beyond your control, but uncertain of what specific form it takes. Then, like a gun shot, or a train wreck, or a car crash, it's all over, the pocket watch cracks, the hour glass is shattered, and things fall apart. Then it's a matter of re-piecing what's broken, fighting the good fight against fate. But can he? And if he can, what will he have to sacrifice to make it more than a possibility?\\n\\nIn addition to fate, the show attempts to integrate two different theories of time travel within its narrative: the Multiple Worlds Interpretation and the Butterfly Effect. To better understand the former, imagine this. Any person's past self decides on one act over the other, an act they wouldn't otherwise have committed if they weren't influenced by something sent to them from the future, a text message, for instance. According to the Multiple Worlds Interpretation, that decision results in a shift from one timeline, or world line, to another. Events and memories in this new world line, as opposed to the old one, are modeled after that different decision. The shift occurs only if a different decision was, indeed, made. Were I, for instance, to send a text message to the past such that it would cause the receiver to commit suicide, the world line would shift, or diverge, to a world where the suicide took place. Events and memories in this new world line would correspond both to the shock of the loss and the absence of that person. For more information on the subject, look up Hugh Everett's The Theory of the Universal Wave Function, Bryce DeWitt's The Many-Worlds Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics, and the scoop behind John Titor. To better understand the latter, imagine this. Any act from the current future that would tamper with the past would cause a ripple and snowball effect that would alter what events happen and what memories are made in the altered future. The further back in time the tampering, the more drastic and seemingly random the outcome, regardless of how insignificant said tampering, such as the death of a butterfly, appears. For more information on the subject, read up on Ray Bradbury's “A Sound of Thunder.”\\n\\nFor casual watchers, the supposed utilization of these two theories working together makes for great drama, and indeed, Steins;Gate is able to pull off this drama quite well. There are, however, some bits of it that fall because of some theoretical misuse. For one, for all the misadventures and mishaps involving time that occur in the series, the Butterfly Effect is only effectively demonstrated twice, the soda scene and Ruka's sex. The rest can be conceivably chalked up to Multiple Worlds Interpretation, so that begs the question as to why the story to integrate the theory at all if it's barely used. The reason, in my opinion, was to provide a convenient safety net for drama and logic that wouldn't be dramatic or even logical without it. The Butterfly Effect as a drama device works properly if its fatalistic consequences, the loss of control over one's destiny, legitimately pervade throughout. When it's used only twice, and used lazily, then that tension, when looking from retrospect, falls flat. Then there's this point. For knowledgeable time travel fans or observant folk, these two theories are contradictory. Any tampering effect to the past, such as the aforementioned text messages, should result in a divergence, independent of whether or not a different decision was made. Reading Steiner, the ability for the mind to brave the memory overwriting shifts, lacks a solid foundation behind its existence, one that doesn't so much bother me as it has others. While Ruka's gender identity and transgender issues in general are certainly problems no one should take lightly, they feel out of place and immersion breaking in the swath of other events that are far more pressing. Lastly, while each cast member fulfills their role in the plot reasonably well and have a meaningful amount of depth, depth that was naturally coaxed out rather than artificially hastened, there is a definite depth inequality between some recurring characters over others, and an argument which I don't particularly subscribe to as a detriment, even if I bought it, wherein Okabe is the only person who gets any meaningful character development.\\n\\nThe OP, Kanako Ito's “Hacking to the Gate,” utilizes a series of staticky animation overlays, character clones, flash images, and hyperdrive blurs to excellent effect. Plenty is going on that I'd never get bored watching it, and indeed, new things seemed to pop out to me with each particular, and old things that popped out suddenly gained new meaning as the show progressed. To that effect, the OP is a masterful display of foreshadow, foreshadow to events and elements that the story would later introduce and explore. The music itself is a blend of Ito's natural vocals and techno synthetics that, like the visuals themselves, establish an energetically erratic atmosphere. Yui Sakakibara's “Toki Tsukasadoru Juuni no Meiyaku,” translated “The Time-Governing Twelve Covenants,” is the ED for all but the last three episodes. Its visuals consists of a broken pocket watch, a shattered hour glass, and an exposed Makise, visuals which, again, lay subtle amounts of foreshadow to events and come and, once those events have passed, bitter reminders of those experiences. The vocalist, accompanied by a melancholy piano, a mesmerizing drum beat, and an intense guitar strum, is a passionate croon laced with mires of biting tragedy. Episode 22 ED by Takeshi Abo, “Fake Verthandi,” Episode 23 ED, by Kanako Ito, “Sky Clad no Kansokusha,” translated “Sky Clad Observer,” Episode 24 ED, also by Kanako Ito, “Another Heaven,” are all songs that have to be discussed in context to be fully appreciated. And because that context involves spoilers, I suggest just getting to those points in the show yourselves to experience them...\\n\\n...and the rest of the narrative. Outside of some inconsistencies, Steins;Gate is an excellent show, something I'd recommend time travel junkies, sci-fi fans, anime lovers, anyone who wants to enjoy a great story with a great cast and doesn't mind the slow build to get there. Now's the matter of dubbing the name of this endeavor. Operation... shit, what name would go great for this from Norse Mythology? El Psy Congroo? No wait, that's Latin and Greek...\\n\\nI give Steins;Gate a 9 out of 10.\",\n",
       "  'Thanks for taking the time to read my review of Arakawa Under the Bridge! Story: I found the premise of the show to be very intriguing. After the first episode, however, it\\'s clear that the main focus of the story is the people who live under the bridge. While Ko and Nino bond throughout the series, Ko\\'s interactions with the secondary characters are the main attraction. The short mini-story format to each episode helps keep the whole feeling of the show light and easy-going. Art: An interesting mix of styles are used throughout the series. You have some very beautiful backgrounds and character portrayal during themore moving parts, and silly faces for almost every other time. The constant switching suits the zany feel of the show. The character designs are all varied, and interesting.\\n\\nSound: The opening song is very upbeat and cute. The background music and sound effects were suitable for the various situations Ko found himself in. The voice acting was excellent, and I think the actors captured the feeling of their characters perfectly.\\n\\nCharacter: The cast is an interesting collection of weirdos. I loved the different histories, personalities and energy each player brought to the show. Whether it was Star\\'s constant competing with Ko, or Sister\\'s \"badass nun with guns and cookies\" attitude, each character was a pleasure to watch. I was not surprised by the lack of character development, since the crew is so zany; any attempt to change them would take away form the fact that they are all so strange. Ko goes through some development, and the second-to-last episode was very touching.\\n\\nOverall: Not really reading anything about the show, I went into it thinking it would be more dramatic, or romantic. I was happily surprised by the more comical, slice-of-life approach. I was laughing every episode, and I really enjoyed watching Arakawa!\\n\\nTL;DR 5 words/phrases to describe Arakawa Under the Bridge:\\n\\nhilarious, random, silly, weird, touching',\n",
       "  \"This Anime Mononoke Hime is a 2 hour long movie. Ill start by saying this is a beautiful Story that will touch the heart of the viewer. The Story is about a young prince that gets cursed while saving his village, by law he must leave in search of the cure for his curse. The world he goes out to is not beautiful but he has a pure heart and a strong will. this movie is one of those that most anime enthusiast will find appealing. now lets get to business, Ill start by saying that this anime does a great job keeping upa suspenseful atmosphere, there's always something going on where the viewer will want to stick to it and continue watching, the music fills the scenery of the beautiful surroundings and takes you inside, blending in    with what is being portrait at the time.\\nthe art of the scenery is quite great and captivating, there are a few details that if you pay close attention some might see but so tiny it really doesn't matter.\\n the character art for the main characters is well done, however a lot of the other characters such as the villagers most look the same, a better job could have been done there but it does not take away from the greatness of the story.\\nThe characters, well what can I say they're interesting and by no means black and white, they all have things they want, they aren't necessarily good nor evil, which makes the entire movie making you wonder what they will do next, and making the characters  somewhat unpredictable. I feel this is gold nobody likes predictable characters. as far as the characters background and growth go, well there isn't much of that, it is after all only 2 hours, instead the characters reveal traits of their personality and intentions,  which is completely acceptable.\\non a small note there are few heads and arms flying off their respective bodies but you seem to forget it because of everything else going on and the story.\\n I rate this Anime movie a 9 on the scale, and that is very high, even for me but I feel this story is a classic, a beautiful story, and sends a message not only about how we are as humans but to also value the life of animals and nature as a whole, and that every living creature feels, just like any of us.\\n\\nRecommend: Yes, anyone who likes anime will enjoy this classic, and even those who normally don't could enjoy it a lot, because its that good. also this isn't bad for a child to watch if you find a censored version where they cut the scenes of heads and arms flying off, but even then I would still allow my child to watch it; just something for parents to keep in mind.\\n\\nPros: great art, touching and beautiful story, deep message, unpredictable characters, suspenseful, and good action all around.\\n\\nCons: they could have solidified the relationship between the main characters, they were kind of left in between one thing an another.

       "  'WARNING: CONTAINS MINOR SPOILERS Akame ga Kill was a huge disappointment for me. I haven\\'t read the manga but after watching episode 1 I had extremely high hopes for it, but all of it was dashed. Don\\'t get me wrong there are some good bits to it, for example the character designs would pass as decent and ED 2 was just amazing and I like how they blended different timelines (e.g. Mine\\'s Pumpkin and an Imperial empire). However, all in all it was pretty dreadful. First of all the story. I really liked the concept of an assassin group who functions to destroy the corrupt. However, asfor the story as a whole, it can be summed up by these words: So predictable it was unpredictable. Seriously I cannot think of a simpler plot. There wasn\\'t a single major plot twist (Esdeath falling for Tatsumi doesn\\'t count because that did not impact the story as a whole), and everyone would have guessed the outcome. Plus there are so many unanswered questions: how would they build a kingdom without bloodshed? What happened to the rest of the Jaegers? Who would be the new king? etc. which the team have completely ignored.\\n\\nThe animation style I have to admit was decent. The character designs were really good and a huge step up from the manga, especially Akame. Her tatoos were also well designed and I praise the team for this. The array of colours and effects such as that of Mine\\'s Pumpkin or Kurome\\'s rise from Chealsea\\'s sting were very enjoyable. However, the fight scenes were the most childish, tedious and downright stupid ones I have encountered. They seem to follow a formula:\\n1. Give up your element of surprise.\\n2. Declare your name.\\n3. Declare whether you are from Night Raid or the Jaegers.\\n4. Spend 5 minutes talking about what your Teigu does, its strengths and other details.\\n5. Spend another 5 minutes talking about why you think you will win this fight.\\n6. Engage for 10 seconds.\\n7. Be surprised at something of your opponent\\'s.\\n8. Listen to your opponent repeat steps 2-5.\\n9. Repeat step 6.\\n10. Repeat steps 4-9 as many times as possible.\\n11. Finish them with a \"trump card\" you have saved for the last minute which you could have used in the beginning.\\n\\nThe music was quite impressive actually. Iwasaki Taku did a good job with the BGM\\'s which conveyed the mood of that moment extremely well. Skyreach was a fitting OP and Tsukiakari is one of my favourite OP/ED.  \\n\\nThe character development in the story is one of the worst I have seen. Even though most of them had a backstory, almost all could might as well have been killing robots instead of characters. They showed no compassion at all, they have no mercy and more than half the time walk away with nothing more than a shrug. Yes they are assassins but they just killed people in cold blood, and even though the victims aren\\'t innocent, the characters should at least show some form of sorrow.\\n\\nTherefore all in all I believe akame ga Kill was a rather mediocre anime. It has a terrible story and dreadful character development. I personally would not recommend this to any people out there.',\n",
       "  'This review contains *SPOILERS*. Watched in Sub/Dub: Sub Story: 7/10 Overall Princess Kaguya’s story can be broken up into 4 distinct parts. 1. Princess Kaguya is a child, 2. Princess Kaguya has to become a princess, 3. Princess Kaguya has unwanted suitors, 4. Princess Kaguya is being taken away. The first 3 parts of the story overall fit well together, but the last act feels completely out of place. Throughout the story it’s clear that Kaguya is not the average person, and is somehow special compared to other humans. But until the last 20 minutes of the film there was no indication that Kaguya was significantly different fromthose around her. To have her suddenly become this moon princess who could fly and such just felt strange. \\n\\nArt: 7/10\\nThe art style is pretty but Kaguya’s character design didn’t feel consistent. I’m not sure if this was because it was in keeping with the art style to have inconsistencies, but she looks like a different character in nearly every shot (and not just when she was growing at a rapid pace either).\\n\\nSound/Soundtrack: 8/10\\nThe soundtrack is really beautiful but I barely noticed it while watching the film, I wish it was more prominent.\\n\\nCharacter: 5/10\\nWhile Kaguya experiences things that are universally relatable, like having the burden of parental expectations, or being forced to act someone you’re not, the way Kaguya handles them is far from relatable. She starts out as an overjoyed child for the first half of the film, and quickly transitions into a reserved, suffering, woman. While the transition scene for her shift (her running away from the capital), is quite beautiful and nearly poetic, a shift in character doesn’t happen that quickly in real life. Now I know this seems like a petty complaint because we generally don’t have children coming out of bamboo shoots either, but I think the audience is supposed to have sympathy for Kaguya. However, it’s difficult to have sympathy for someone who’s so unrelatable and can change their personality on a whim.\\nFrom other reviews I’ve read, it seems that some of the other characters in this film were misrepresented or different from how they are in the original folktale. With this in mind, I’ll just say that overall the other characters are unlikeable and have worse character development than Kaguya.\\n\\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\nThe film managed to keep my attention for nearly all of its 137 minutes. I do think it could have a shorter runtime and a more clean plot. The “running scene” really makes up for a majority of the disappointments in the film, even though it’s only 30 seconds long. It has so much emotion behind it and the animation really shines during that scene. I wish the film had turned towards a commentary on princesses, rather than the “going back to the moon” thing. I know that’s how the folktale goes but my favorite parts of the film were Kaguya learning how to be a princess and Kaguya dealing with unwanted suitors. I just wanted to see more of that.\\n\\nOverall: 7/10\\nThis is definitely my favorite work from Isao Takahata. I’m still giving it a lower rating because it has pretty much the same issues that all of Takahata’s films have. However, I’m glad that his last work was The Tale of Princess Kaguya. It’s not quite a swan song but it is a wonderful exit from the dedicated director.',\n",
       "  'TL;DR Not for those who are affected by terrorism in any way Watching Terror in Resonance is a bit like reliving the horrible event that happened in NYC. Sure, many movies and pop culture has reference to that tragic day, but nothing quite resemble what Terror in Resonance did, at least in its first act. MIXED - Story In essence, Terror in Resonance is a detective story. But instead of watching a lone wolf detective trying to bust his balls chasing criminals who are always one step ahead, we are treated with a cat-and-mouse chase. We know who the culprits are early on and weknow what they are up to.  But we don\\'t know why they are the way they are and why they did the things they did.  This is where the anime gets interesting.\\n\\nTerrorism is such a sensitive topic in our real world society right now, yet the creators of this anime is not afraid to bring it to the forefront of our minds.  This is not for those who still think they are affected by any form of terrorism in any way, shape or form, be it 9/11, Charlie Hebdo or Boko Haram.  It is graphical, even though no deaths are involved, at least none that has been reported (but that does not mean it\\'s victimless).  It\\'s a bit like the IRA back in the last century when the police was warned before the bombs went off.\\n\\nIn Terror in Resonance, the terrorists (two teenagers who called themselves Sphinx) forewarn the authority by the way of a video uploaded to the internet.  They give out a puzzle about the location of the explosive device and leave the cops to figure out where.  The first terrorist act that they performed is very much akin to the 9/11 tragedy.  The settings might be different, but the impact is just the same.  There were no casualties, but one of the towers of the government building in the Shinjuku district was destroyed.\\n\\nAs the story progresses, the terrorists put their crafts in places that cause mayhem.  However, there is a conflict of interest here.  On one hand, their goal is to disrupt daily lives by blowing things up, but on the other, they actually do not want to cause fatality.  Sure, you can disrupt lives without killing, but why threaten to blow up something in a crowded area when you are not actually planning to go through it, knowing that the end result have a high probability of causing death?\\n\\nOn the other end is the cops who, despite mobilising a huge amount of resources, seems to be helpless.  In come Shibazaki, a demoted cop who happens to be really good at investigating these sort of things.  He is the driver who solve the riddles being raised by the terrorists.\\n\\nThe whole series gives off this \"Ghost In The Shell\" vibe about it.  It is dark, sinister and mysterious.  However, it doesn\\'t provoke any deep thinking in the same way GITS might.  In the end, it is a story about how the cops chase down a bunch of teenagers who happen to know a lot of stuff about blowing things up.\\n\\nGOOD - Characters\\n\\nFor every good crime thriller, there must have some well thought-out characters who support the script.  Luckily, Terror in Resonance offers a bunch of different, if not all interesting, group of individuals.\\n\\nNine is the mastermind of the entire terror operation.  He is calculated, calm and logical.  Twelve forms the second half of their little terror outfit.  He is playful, daring and lot more cheerful than his counterpart.  The third member to join them inadvertently is Lisa Mishima, a klutzy girl who runs away from her troubled mother and the bullies from school.  She ends up staying with the Sphinx pair and is the source of some light hearted moment in an otherwise dark anime.\\n\\nOn the other side of the fence is Shibazaki, the lone cop who actually cares about the motive behind all the terrorist attacks in a time when the rest of the police force only care about how to stop the terrorists.  He is later joined by a hot headed partner who initially rejects the Shibazaki way, but eventually comes around.  Sadly, this pair sounds too much like a cliche pair of Hollywood cops.\\n\\nGetting in the middle of it all is Five, a super intelligent girl from the FBI who seems to be somehow related to Nine and Twelve.  Sadly, she proves to be the weakest link in the series with her outlandish personality and a somewhat ridiculously childish plot to stop the terror by, wait for it, causing more terror.\\n\\nThere is not much character development in the show, but luckily the show is not character driven.\\n\\nMIXED - Graphics\\n\\nThe attention to details is nothing short of perfection.  From the computer screen (which looks remarkably like Windows / Mac) to the explosion, everything is in its place.  The character design fits the character in question.  The cheerful Twelve wears outgoing casual weekend wear while Nine is more conservative in is choice of clothing.\\n\\nHowever, the art style is not to everyone\\'s taste.  The creators use hard solid lines, everyone seems to be suffering from vitamin D deficiency.  They are all so pale and lack skin tone.  You can hardly find any soft colour in the series and everything is dark and heavy.\\n\\nUltimately, the graphics in Terror is more of a personal taste than anything.  Some might be put off by the lack of warm colour, while others would praise the aesthetic approach that the creators took.\\n\\nBAD - OP/ED\\n\\nI will probably burn in hell for this.  But I, for one, did not like the OP and ED of Terror in Resonance.  I cannot pinpoint the one thing that I didn\\'t like about it, but the songs sound rough and unrefined.  I know that some viewers would love it.  The one exception is the final slow melody that is vastly different from the other songs.\\n\\nPlease feel free to disagree.\\n\\nGOOD - Music / Sound\\n\\nThe BGM to the anime is much better.  The music is cheerful relative to the artistic direction that Terror has taken.  It\\'s much more soothing than the OP/ED.  The sound is also well done.  Explosions, helicopters, trains, gun shots, everything mixes well with the environment.  It really feels as if you were there.\\n\\nOVERALL\\n\\nTerror in Resonance is an anime that provoke.  Whether it\\'s the artistic style, the theme or the plot, it would make some viewers uncomfortable.  That said, the series is by no mean more sinister than your average crime thriller.  You might not feel for the two teenagers.  After all, they are committing a crime, regardless of motive.\\n\\nThe plot is intense and interesting to watch.  Characters are, in the majority of cases, an ensemble that support each other to tell a story.  Art and sound are areas up for debate.  There are some rough edges, but in the overall scheme of things, Terror in Resonance is enjoyable to watch.',\n",
       "  '\"So could these lights be shadows of something? If they are shadows, their bodies must exist somewhere else. Could things that exist somewhere else in some other world be creating these lights?\" Clannad After Story, sequel to another brilliant project of Key visual arts, brings you the magic of what a story can hold. It has the old high school romance, the friends, the drama, but it\\'s not afraid and most certainly not attempting to hide it\\'s supernatural aspect. You won\\'t feel intact with the beauty of what Clannad has to offer if you don\\'t realize the \\'magic\\' behind it all. It brings life, and wondersto what life itself actually is. \\n\\nStory: 10/10 - Proceeding from Clannad\\'s last season, we have our beloved Nagisa and Tomoya, who are now thankfully a couple to die for. Once the first portion of the show is over, it enters into what we\\'ve been waiting for, the focus on the two MC\\'s, and how they\\'re now involved with each others futures, and the events, or drama that happens within it. Friends seem almost non-existent when you are in love, all your mind can think about are images of that person\\'s face, the one you know you can\\'t live without. Okazaki and Nagisa went one way, and all of their fellow classmates soon depart another. Whether you were a Nagisa fan from the beginning or not the story almost twists you into having a bit of sympathy in the least, and I feel if a writer is able to do something like that, then round up the applauses because damn am I impressed! \\n\\nIt\\'s a vast universe, when you lock souls with that other, it almost seems like a miracle. \\n\\nArt: 9/10 - From the unique visuals used for the toy robot and the Illusionary girl, to the mere fluidity in Tomoyo\\'s 1,000 kick combo! I have never been less than impressed when it comes to a Key production. The opening songs are beautiful in both art and sound and I can\\'t get enough of the foreshadowing. Kyoto\\'s visual arts know when to emphasize a scene of significance; the baseball soaring through the air, it turns into a close-up, spinning ever so slowly, and then we return to the story of the Illusionary girl, and the field which constantly emits these orbs of light, floating, as if the world they\\'re in, has it\\'s own sort of weather. The atmosphere of Clannad is what pulls one into the anime, almost like you\\'re experiencing it all as well.\\n\\nSound: 8/10 - Again, the opening songs for the prequel and Clannad AS itself were both very pleasing to the ears, but had a kind of melancholic tone, this only grows stronger as you progress through the series because you then are able to reflect on all the characters as you see the images pass by. The sound effects for everything else aren\\'t much to write home about but the soundtrack is quite amazing! The synchronization of the bgm and the scene at hand could be the reason you find yourself bawling or tearing up on the side because of how heavy it all feels at once. I have no words for how sad one single soundtrack could make you feel. \\n\\nCharacters: 9/10 - The idiot, the genius, the tsundere, the tomboy, the shy girl, the airhead, the goofball. All of these generic characters in one show, but how do they manage to be so entertaining and get them spot-on? Because it\\'s just done well, and isn\\'t boring, or frustrating and repititive. The characters mingle with each other like how they\\'re suppose to and nothing seems out of place, or unordinary. Aside from Fuko. Now that relationships have developed and it\\'s almost time for graduation, the \\'friends\\' almost seem like a family. \\n\\nDango Dai kazoku!\\n\\nEnjoyment: 10/10 - Never will I forget such a series, and I will continue to recommend it as long as I keep interest in anime, and I don\\'t plan on abandoning it anytime soon. Let\\'s hope it sticks, but Clannad can and WILL teach you a few things about life, it isn\\'t easy but miracles do happen, so don\\'t let go of that strand of hope, and keep on pushing for what it is you seek. It\\'ll all be worth it! Just like an alternate world, there are always alternative options, don\\'t fret, keep your eyes on the prize! As they say.',\n",
       "  \"Whisper of the Heart is an excellent coming of age story that can appeal to everyone. When I first watched this movie I was disappointed that it wasn't some epic fantasy adventure. Upon a second watching I fell in love with this film. It captures the struggles of an artist and all the doubts that come along with it. The feelings come across very naturally, each character has their own worries. If you are an artist or feel lost in life this movie hits close to home. My only complaint was the soundtrack. In comparison to the scores of other Studio Ghibli films it lackedthe magic it normally has. Besides that the movie overall still managed to have its own charm. I love how the art makes everyday life seem beautiful. Thank you for reading :)\",\n",

       "  \"Having watched this right before I'we written this review, I didn't know what to expect. Then the first frames came in. Whoa! WHOA! OH MY JESUS! This is it! This is how you make cell animation in 2008! I can tell ya, NOTHING EVER was this beautifully drawn before! I don't think I was even breathing during the second story! It easily puts every other cell animated title to shame(ONLY in terms of animation), and will be the only thing for YEARS to come that will deserve a perfect score. For how it is drawn, naturally. For in every other aspect, 5 Centimetres per second is a mixed bag. Wehave one story going back and forth on the line from stupid to beautiful. One that is exactly how the entire feature should have been, and one that's just plain moronic. But let's go with the airing order, shall we?\\n\\nThe first story: I don't really know. Sure, it's anice little topic, lovers seperated and all, but it seems as if common sense would be cast aside for drama. How is it, that in the present day, two people who are in love with each other but seperated still communicate by mail? Why does it take a train trip to get the idea of using the telephone to keep in touch? Why does the story give us the illusion that the meeting itself solved anything when later on it disproves itself? Sure enough, the train trip felt agonizing at times (a HUGE plus), but it was just a bit too melodramatic. So like I said, I can't really put it anywhere.\\n\\nThe second story: HELL YEAH! Now this is romance! I don't know how the show manages to make the viewer forget that the imagery plays a huge part in conveying the overall tone, but it does, and you just sit back, and enjoy a rendition of a girls emotions that is so beutiful, and most importantly, so REAL(unlike 90% of everything else in this regard), you instantly forgive life for failures like Tokikaku. This story has a heart, this story has a soul, this story is so much better then the other two, you would have to think it was written by a completely different person! The best of the bunch, hands down!\\n\\nAnd so, we arrived at story three, the train to real life will leave from here in ten minutes, we apologize for the inconvenience.\\n\\nEver been on a roller coaster? Harken back to the time when you were on it first, the mesmerizing felling of climbing ever higher and higher, until the point where you reach the top, and suddenly, you realise that you don't really want to go down, but you will anyway, and besides, it's the only way to get back on the ground. Not to mention that you can't do anything about it. Now imagine that suddenly, while you are at the top, the roller coaster crumbles undernath you, and you plummet to your doom at terminal velocity until you stop sixteen feet under ground leaving a crater big enough to fit the entire roller coaster in. This is as close as you will come to the experience that is the third story, something for wich the person who gave the green light for it's enclusion should have his/her lungs exposed to ridiculus amounts of Zyklon B. It tryes, and HOW it tryes to give a fitting aftermath to the first story, but the degree it fails at this makes you question the sanity of the mind that ever thought of it's creation, let alone inclusion! It haphazardly introduces new characters for no known reason, and succeeds in making (at least) the main character look like a totally unrelatable, ununderstandable retard by not only having him NOT living in contact with his girl, but rather getting a new one, WHITOUT SEPERATING HIMSELF FROM THE FIRST ONE, AND BEING ANXIOUS ABOUT IT! Basically any bit of common sense that was gathered for these characters in the first story goes out the window so fast, you wonder why there was any reason giving them any in the first place. Plus, it doesn't solve anything! It's Bullshit with a capital B (no, better, a backwards b, a d), and ultimately pulls the production down into mediocre junk territory for making everyone believe that the characters of the first and third story are the real focus of the story, completely overshadowing the brilliant second one. (Thankfully, it's barely ten minutes long, so it can't detract from the value of it's prettyness and it's middle.)\\n\\nOh, and if you are going to have a male solo artist singing the end theme of your show, make sure you get one that doesn't sound like me when drunk and trying to parody sing(this goes double for L'arc en ciel).\\n\\nNo wait, Japan doesn't have any of those.\",\n",
       "  'Have you ever gotten that feeling of overwhelming sadness once you finish an anime/manga because you know there will never be another one like it in its genre? That was the feeling I got when I finished Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood. After the controversy of the first Fullmetal Alchemist anime deviating greatly from the manga, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood was created as a completely faithful adaptation of the manga. Despite being a shounen series, Brotherhood adopts a unique, more mature approach to action shounen anime while still retaining the basic qualities of the genre. The series takes place in a small, but powerful country called Amestris that mirrors NaziGermany. Amestris is a militaristic totalitarian country in which its most powerful figure (well, sorta) is the head of the military, addressed as Führer. There are many other historical references, including imperialistic desires, trench warfare, and an event similar to the Holocaust, and they help us to understand the situation Amestris is in at the start of the series.\\n\\nThe story follows the journey of teenage alchemists Edward and Alphonse Elric, brothers determined to get back their original bodies after a deadly accident following a failed Human Transmutation. As they try to find the legendary Philosopher’s Stone, an all-powerful item that can purportedly return them to their bodies, it becomes apparent that this mysterious object is tied in to every single conflict Amestris has been in. Unlike other shounens’ plots, which are tailored to maximize fighting, FMA’s plot is intriguing and full of genuine suspense. At its core though, the series is an endearing story about the resilient bond between two brothers who’ll never give up until they achieve their goal, despite seemingly impossible odds and obstructing obstacles.\\n\\nIn the series, alchemy is a blend of supernaturalism and chemistry that essentially takes an object and changes or transmutes it into a different object. A highly practical ability, alchemy can be used for medical purposes, fighting, building, etc. As an aspiring science major, this is one part of the series that really impressed me. For instance, there is a scene where Ed is forced to fight a character that can shield his body with diamond, one of the hardest substances on earth. After realizing the makeup of the shield, Ed transmutes the diamond into graphite (both are allotropes of carbon), a much more brittle substance. All the carbon atoms were still present, but now they were rearranged to weaken the shield. The incorporation of chemistry gives the fights so many possibilities. The Law of Conservation of Mass is somewhat applied to alchemy in the concept called Equivalent Exchange. Whatever the amount you use is the amount you receive. Of course, one of the powers of the Philosopher’s Stone is the ability to defy this rule of Equivalent Exchange, a reason why it is so coveted.\\n\\nMuch of the fighting in this series is relegated to close combat (until the final battle). Usually, the combatants are armed with some type of weapon, or if they’re alchemists, they can also transmute projectiles. But sometimes, the fights are as simple as hand to hand combat. Few people have truly unique abilities, especially since most fighting alchemists have similar abilities and the normal people can’t use any supernatural abilities anyway, so you won’t see crazy destructive powers like those of Naruto or Bleach. However, don’t misconstrue the fights to be any less exciting. The action is just as exhilarating, and with the inclusion of alchemy, we often see incredible environmental manipulation. Strategy is important, so the alchemic principle of understanding is sometimes crucial in fights. However, as a shounen that is more plot-driven than most, some of the fights are rather one-sided. After all, fights are supposed to be decided quickly, not take up several episodes and waste our times. Many of the fights serve to advance the plot, so more than anything, we see character development and learn more about the events preceding the series during these fights.\\n\\nThe characters are easily the best part of the series. There are many of them, and they all serve specific roles in the series. The most important ones are given fleshed-out backstories, and through these, we learn about their unique personalities, values, and internal conflicts, as well as get a sense of what exactly happened to lead up to the actual events of the series. Each character has some sort of goal that they hope to achieve, be it a return to a previous life, revenge, becoming the next Führer, or achieving immortality. The main antagonists of the series are the Homunculus, an immortal group of near-invincible creatures with human exteriors. There are seven of them, each one representing one of the Seven Deadly Sins, and much of their personalities and goals are based upon their respective sins. Their mysterious “Father” is the one who created them. These characters are far from one-dimensional. Their psychological conflicts and emotional backgrounds really help you empathize with them. In fact, Fullmetal Alchemist has spawned a number of my favorite characters.\\n\\nNow, despite all the praise I’ve given to Brotherhood, it does have a few setbacks, although whether these can be called setbacks depends on the viewer. The show often likes to resort to light-hearted slapstick comedy typical of a shounen series. Accompanying this is the occasional use of the chibi style of art. Some people may find this aggravating, although I personally have no problem with it. Also, the pacing of the series is somewhat inconsistent. Initially, the series moves rather quickly, resolving conflicts in only one or two episodes. At times, this gave the series an episodic feel. However, the pacing becomes much more streamlined towards the middle. Towards the latter part of the series, the pacing slows down considerably, and the final arc pretty much occurs within the span of a few hours. Again though, I found no problem with this personally, and the way the show was paced at different parts worked well with the occurrences in the plot.\\n\\nThe music is very suitable for the atmosphere of the show, giving an eerie, serious, ethereal, heartwarming, tragic, or lively feel depending on the scene. It’s not exactly memorable though, but it works. All the OPs and EDs are fairly good as well. On the other hand, the voice acting is perfect for the characters, especially Ed’s voice. Emotions are flawlessly conveyed through the voice actors. The animation is also fantastic. The fight scenes are exciting and flow well. No choppy movements. Occasionally, the faces do look somewhat disfigured and disproportionate (often times Mustang’s), but other than that, the artwork is detailed and generally solid.\\n\\nFullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood was an amazing experience. Its world is so intricate, but gradually, everything is explained in full detail, and it truly is beautifully crafted.  This isn’t just another shounen anime. Its incorporation of political, religious, psychological, and philosophical elements and its focus on plot over fighting definitely make it a much more mature series than your typical shounen. At the same time, its slapstick comedy and grand fights are the reason for its shounen tag, but that’s not a bad thing. Also, this is the only action series that has invoked any serious emotion in me, showing that I actually cared about these characters. It is unfortunate to see it end, but all good things must eventually come to an end. This is a shounen that’s done right.',\n",
       "  'What I felt when I watched \"Howl\\'s Moving Castle\" was pure happiness. The story was one of the \"happy ending\" type with a little twist in the middle. A lot of action and magic, coupled with serious lessons for all viewers to understand. I liked it a lot that I watched it a couple of more times. The art was simple, so simple that it made the movie clean and give off the impression of it being a very light and enjoyable movie. The characters of the story was very well portrayed. It actually made me curious of thepast of each character, though the movie did not emphasize too much on it. Hopefully, I\\'ll be able to read the book.  Over-all, I really enjoyed this movie and I would not hesitate to say that I would watch it over and over again.',\n",
       "  'I remember hearing a lot of hype for Parasyte when it was first announced for an anime adaptation. Apparently, it was a really popular manga in the 90s about some kid who got his hand infected by an alien parasite – hence the name I suppose, although I’m not sure why the “i” was changed into a “y” – and must now learn to live with it whilst warding off other similar infected people who had the misfortune of being killed by these beings before having their entire existence taken over. Seemed like good body horror stuff as is, but then came the influx ofpeople I knew who read the manga that declared it to be the second coming of Christ and my hype for it was decent whilst not being astounding because it was being done by a Madhouse team whose only credits were to their Marvel stuff and isn’t that just another clue that they’re not the powerhouse they used to be? Well it turns out that I was right to be cautious, because not only does Parasyte not live up to the hype, but it’s knee-deep in pretty much everything I despise about Marvel stuff to boot.\\n\\nYou know your show with dick hands and uncensored decapitations has problems when I can think of five shows from Fall 2014 I’d rather watch over it and one of them is from KyoAni. But before I get into thrashing this show, I’ll admit that I’m glad Parasyte was made, if only because its popularity will hopefully lead to more classic manga getting adapted, thus lessening the huge surplus of LN adaptations we’ve been getting as of late. In an age where self-awareness is replacing actual humor, we really do need more manga adaptations that take themselves seriously, and this along with Attack on Titan are prime candidates for ushering in that age. So thank you Parasyte for representing a spark the animation industry desperately needs now that Kickstarter has shat the bed, but that’s not going to stop me from beating you to death with a croquet bat that has spikes nailed into it.\\n\\nParasyte, or Parasyte-the maxim if you want to be an asshole about it, is an adaptation of a 90s manga about a kid named Shinichi whose normal life is shattered when aliens land on his world and one of them infects his right hand in the process of trying to kill him, causing him to have a “mature relationship” with it, if you get what I mean. The story basically follows him and his desire to live a normal life whilst dealing with the changes going on in his life caused by his new situation like dating girls, helping his family, and fighting off others like him who had the misfortune of getting killed and controlled by their own infected diseases. I might as well be calling him Asian Peter due to how much he resembles Peter Parker from Spiderman in terms of situation and personality.\\n\\nIn fact, many things about Parasyte are pretty much copied wholesale from Spiderman, like the alien infections, uninteresting supervillains, incompetent police force, large sections of the plot, and even the fact that the symbiotes…er, I mean parasytes are weak to fire. The only thing it didn’t rip off was everything that made Spiderman fun like the web swinging. How cool would it have been for Asian Peter to use his right hand to swing across buildings whilst wise-cracking like a…um, actually if it means less snarky remarks, I think I’ll accept that sacrifice whilst still snarling at the twenty other things you could have included. Because as emo as Peter got at times, at least he traded in the angst for some f*cking awesome dance moves.\\n\\nAsian Peter on the other hand can’t even do awesome fight moves. For something that’s supposed to be one of the major draws of the show, why does every single fight scene look like it was choreographed by Yuen-Woo Ping on the set of Cradle 2 the Grave? Whenever an action scene occurred, it would always consist of boring blade spam or five minutes of Asian Peter conversing with his hand followed by five seconds of actual action at best and two seconds of embarrassment that would make Kill la Kill laugh out loud at worst, which isn’t exciting in the least. It also doesn’t help that the music in this show is so f*cking mismatched to what’s going on that the supposed horror vibe this show coasts on is about as existent as an American-made Silent Hill game with a heavy metal soundtrack. For all that work put into having the violence uncensored and having good animation, you sure didn’t do a good job of putting some actual flair on-screen, did you Marvel director? Although considering your credits and the state of the action we get in those films, it’s kind of apropos.\\n\\nHowever, the biggest flaw that Parasyte - along with said Marvel films – has is that it doesn’t seem to have a story at all, always heading in one direction before bailing halfway through to focus on another in a round robin that would make Spiderman 3 confused. We start off with Asian Peter basically imitating what makes Spiderman great by getting going through puberty whilst dealing with the consequences of his new-found powers, so I figured that Parasyte was going to be a coming-of-age story. But after he gets turned into a superhuman, that story is put to the side to have him turn into a monster and deal with a love triangle between Asian Mary Jane and Asian Gwen Stacy that ends with the latter’s tragic death to showcase his change. So Parasyte is a story about how having powers turns you into a jerk that will hurt your loved ones?\\n\\nNope. After said tragedy, Asian Peter suddenly stops acting like a monster and instead angsts about how he can’t protect anyone whilst other humans start getting involved, culminating in a sort-of-sympathetic character getting killed off in order to teach us about discrimination and how there are good people amongst the parasites just as there are bad people amongst the humans and thus they’re no different from each other when you get down to it. So your story is about how overcoming discrimination is hard, especially when you factor in the different natures of humans and non-humans, but it’s not impossible? Wrong! The real story is that “humanity is a flawed species who will always fight for themselves at the end of the day”. And even that’s mishandled badly, as leaving aside that they showcase this fact by having a bunch of stupid soldiers shoot up a building, culminating in Asian Peter killing off a super-strong experimental parasyte that’s basically the love child of Doc Ock and Venom in order to prevent more deaths, it tries to compromise by delivering the same environmental stuff that made Princess Mononoke so good. Y’know, how humans and animals are just fighting for themselves and the only reason they protect the environment at the end of the day is because they’ll die if they don’t?\\n\\nBut it completely falls flat because it can’t seem to make up its mind regarding whether parasytes should be compared more to humans or lions, and it fails at providing a strong case for either side. The show makes a big point about how parasytes were sent to Earth in order to cleanse humanity for its crimes, so if they are comparable to humans, it’d be one of those PETA nuts channeling Jeffrey Dahmer. And if they’re supposed to be compared to lions, that fails too because last I checked, lions can’t blend in with humans much less eat at Burger King without having eyes and shotguns pointed in its direction. Not to mention, if lions really are living amongst us, killing people in secret like the parasytes have done, I say we make those motherf*ckers extinct.\\n\\nParasyte’s core message regarding humanity and its relationship with the world is a good idea on paper, but the way it comments on it really leaves a lot to be desired. If the show had focused on centering Asian Peter and his right hand as an ironic victim akin to the protagonist in District 9 or as the failed mediator between two species akin to Caesar in the Planet of the Apes reboot, this might have worked. But instead, it meanders with repetitive philosophy that anyone out of middle school would know, can’t make up its mind regarding whether Asian Peter is growing and how he’s growing, indulges in really shitty shonen action cliches, and it doesn’t help that the ending doesn’t make any goddamn sense. I’ve heard a lot of people talk up how perfect it is, but all it did was have Asian Symbiote-less Carnage kidnapping Asian Mary Jane in order to confirm what we already knew, which is about as mundane an ending as you can possibly get in a philosophical narrative.\\n\\nAm I being too hard on an anime whose source material dates back to before the environmental trend was really a thing? Maybe, but that didn’t stop the original Persona game from getting thrashed when it got re-released, so why shouldn’t I criticize Parasyte for basically arriving way too late to have any impact on me? Plus, if it was really as good as people said, time would be kinder to it than this. But that’s irrelevant, because I’m judging the anime on its own. And on its own, Parasyte is just not a good show. I wouldn’t go so far as to say it’s a bad one, but I can’t really say I’ll be watching it again anytime soon.',\n",
       "  \"This anime ended up being something far different from what I thought it would be about from it's title, yet, I wasn't disappointed at all. I'm a sucker for anime that teach you life lessons and are in some ways inspiring in the sense of bettering yourself as a person. I certainly didn't expect to get that from this anime. The supposed bad guy in this anime is the yellow octopus creature who is the teacher of a classroom of misfits whose objective is to assassinate said bad guy. Yet, from all the episodes, he really doesn't seem like a bad guy. In fact, toa certain extent you start feeling like you don;t want him to be assassinated at all because he's such an awesome octopus.\\n\\nThis first season is all about introducing the important characters of the series. It explores their personalities and what they excel at, so that we can get connections and chemistry with these characters. No doubt so that later on we feel it when something tragic happens. This anime is also light-humored so you will get some little laughs in as it progresses. It doesn't try too hard to be good so I really like this anime, so I give it an overall 9.\"]}"

       "  'It\\'s games like this that make me wish Steam still had the \"Maybe recommend\" option.This game looks great and is FUN (something many games lack these days). I like the combat, Valhiem-like food and comfort systems, talent trees, base building, and I especially love that you can have armour you equip for stats and separate armour you equip for cosmetic appearance.However, after ~35 hours and being about halfway through the second zone, my desire to play more has been eroded. Like my character in game, I don\\'t have the stamina to play anymore. Below are my gripes with the game and how I\\'d like it to be improved:QUESTS AND LOREThis game is FAR TOO bloated with way too many quests and too much lore that it\\'s difficult to continue to care about.When questing, I like to plan an \"expedition\" where I try to handle a group of quests. I try take enough resources with me (healing items, food, etc) to support how long I plan to be away from my base.It is extremely difficult to tell the difference between simple \"go here\" quests and \"this is the first step in a long chain of objectives\" quests, as you\\'re only told of further objectives once you\\'ve travelled to the location of the previous objective.I would frequently find myself either running out of resource and unable to complete my planned quests, or wasting my time on a group of sundry unsatisfying quests.Vague and not always present warnings from the NPCs to \"prepare carefully\" for certain objectives are not helpful, especially with a quest log full of dozens of quests I\\'m struggling to pare down!For the lore, there\\'s way too much! Little notes, diaries, songs, poems, newspapers, NPC dialogue...! And I keep finding it all OUT OF ORDER! So much of the emotional impact is RUINED because I find the \"farewell my sweet daughter\" letter long before the \"my daughter is Sick but I have Hope\" one.I don\\'t want to read everything all jumbled and have to parse it later... I don\\'t want to wait until I\\'ve got all the entries then sit down and do my \"reading chores\" all in one go... and frankly, I don\\'t want to have to keep STOP PLAYING THE GAME to read all this! Especially when a good sixty percent of it boils down to \"World\\'s gone to ♥♥♥♥\"! I am aware the world went to ♥♥♥♥! It\\'s all anyone talks about! It is the premise of the game I chose to play!!To fix this... get rid of it! Trim down, keep what\\'s important, learn to tell the story without the bloat. Work out a way to allow the player to stay more \"on rails\" if they want to.CLASSESI played this game with my boyfriend. I pretty quickly started down the Barbarian route, and he - after some experimentation with Ranger - went Mage.I loved swinging my big weapon around, bashing up enemies, but my bf really struggled to survive. Enemies would run DIRECTLY PAST ME to get to him. I struggled to help him because I spent my stamina fighting, I didn\\'t have enough to chase enemies he was running from.I felt really pressured to start going into the Tank route to try and mitigate this, meaning I couldn\\'t play the way I wanted nor take talents I was looking forward to.How on earth could someone play any ranged class single-player? At one point in a dungeon we were beset by what felt like - no exaggeration - hundreds of enemies all at once... Without someone to tank the enemies, how could a Ranger or Mage handle that?If there are going to be multiple class options, every single one needs to be viable for singleplayer, and people playing with friends shouldn\\'t be pressured into the tank + healer + DPS setup. Everyone should be able to play how they want, not be made to longingly look at what they can\\'t have every time they level up. NPCsChrist, the NPCs are boring. In essence, they\\'re glorified crafting tables - that\\'s all they do! They don\\'t talk to each other, they don\\'t do anything but walk about (and I had to turn THAT off because they kept vanishing), and building homes for them was exactly like making a villager farm in Minecraft or a tenement block in Terraria. When they give me quests, it\\'s either for an upgrade to their crafting or for a pointless, unsatisfying quest reward I long since outleveled. Sorry you made that sword for your daughter, dude. I scrapped it. It was useless to me. This has no emotional impact on me at all.NPCs should till my fields, speed up my workstations, sweep my floors, gather wood or stone... actually act like I\\'m building a village, a new world in the ruins of the last! EXPLORATIONNgl, I got pretty sick of making my way \"as the crow flies\" towards a quest marker, only for another bloody cliff to be in the way... and when I try to find my way around, it turns out I went in the wrong direction.There should be a climbing mechanic, or a way to use the grappling hook to pull me up to more places than Ledges With The Special Grappling Hook Point.Also, the speed in which you go up/down ladders and those crosshatch grate things needs to be sped up, it\\'s really frustrating.CRAFTINGEarly game the crafting was really nice, felt like I was really making stuff! Then it became a series of workbenches that just... process stuff and I just wait. I understand the necessity of such things, and every game has such, but as the game progressed it felt like most of the crafting became \"stick it in this oven and wait for it to bake\".The cooking was excellent! I really liked sitting down by the fire and actually cooking. But then I unlocked the kettle-and-campfire which turned it into... stick it in the oven and wait for it to bake but slower than you can do yourself. I would\\'ve liked to feel like I was actually creating more.IN CONCLUSIONI enjoyed my time in this game and I\\'m sad I got tired of it. I don\\'t regret buying, and I\\'ll pencil this in for maybe playing again in a few years.',\n",

       "  \"I want to like this game but it is so ungodly unbalanced against the player it isn't even funny. Upgrading gear from tier 2 to 3 is a slog that makes you want to quit the game. Trecking through higher level areas to try and find materials only to be 1 or 2 shot by everything that breathes in that area is ridiculous. Ranged combat has no skill trees as of yet which leaves you with melee being the only thing you can actually skill up.Graphically the game is pretty good. The lighting engine has some serious issues when playing at 4k with everything maxed out.Overall mechanics seems to work fairly good. Movement and combat feel good but are a little bit clunky at times. Dark souls style combat with the parry and dodge is good except that there isn't any way to truly upgrade your stamina so in group fights you dodge 2 or 3 times and are basically screwed at that point\",\n",
       "  'Good Coop Shooter, awful SWAT game.Alright, the main issue I have with this game is extremely fixable; the suspect AI are ALL psychopathic cop killers who WANT to die. The way every suspect acts would be fine for terrorists, or like the \"Russian mobster\" guys in later levels, but it makes no sense for the majority of suspects like criminals who held up a gas station, security guards, or my favorite; random people in their own apartments. These \"suspects\" will: 1. Always be armed. (And we\\'re talking 50 round smgs first level, AKs second level) 2. Always shoot at cops. (Do you remember suspects running away in SWAT 4? Yeah no one ever runs away in this game, they just attack you until one of you dies.) They\\'ll literally bust down doors to attack officers they hear yelling. 3. Never surrender from being yelled at. (And also barely ever surrender when SHOT, like legitimately they\\'ll surrender to a beanbag gun shot, but not a real bullet.) 4. Fake surrender like 25% of the time, just to try to kill you, and throw their life away, even when they\\'re under gunpoint from your entire team. They\\'ll fake dying to gunshots too. 5. Grab hostages. 6. Shoot through walls. (The best part is when your SWAT AI shoots back through walls and kills civilians - yes, this happens.) Special shout-out to the Private Security who will spray through cover with automatic rifles upon seeing part of your leg, and thus kill their own co-workers.Every single suspect, from Terrorists, Mobsters, School-shooters, Cultists, Crack-heads, Gas Station robbers,  random people in their own homes, FBI AGENTS (Yes there is a target on a level who is a \"FISA\" agent)... they all act either exactly the same, or so similar that it really is impossible to tell the difference.This game is a great first person shooter, and I\\'ve had a lot of fun goofing around in multiplayer, but this is supposed to be a SWAT game, and the AI just takes me out of it so much, they are so over the top bloodthirsty. Again, no problem with later levels with actual terrorists and stuff like that. SWAT 4 ends with you fighting armored, machine gun toting terrorists as well, (Ironically I think they\\'re still less insane than regular Ready Or Not suspects) but it starts with pretty simple levels, with suspects who act more or less how they should. Level 2 in this game tells you that you\\'re going to stop a hostage situation with ONE PERSON. Instead you fight 11 petty criminals, who, in their own apartments, with no fore-warning from the police, just walk around armed, and decide that they all want to die today.The ridiculous part about this is that I remember the suspects actually being much more reasonable when the game first launched on steam.I could make a whole other review going over other issues like bugs (TONS OF BUGS), the AI being stupid, the game not being particularly stable, matchmaking not working well, mod.io being awful, optimization being really bad, the briefings lying, the lack of info the game gives players, bad development decisions - like remaking the same levels over and over, the recent update being a massive letdown, removing a bunch of variants for levels, removing weapons (that are still referenced in the game btw)... I wanted to focus on a more foundational issue with the game\\'s design. All of these things can be changed, and If they would just fix the insane AI, I would recommend this game. If this was say... Ground Branch, the AI would be acceptable, good even, if you ignore the bugs... but this is supposed to be a SWAT game.I notice in other reviews people saying that everyone just needs to \"git gud\". I want to be clear, this is not a difficulty thing. I\\'ve S ranked all of the levels, and completing all of the levels isn\\'t hard. The AI is just so far removed from natural behavior that it completely ruins all immersion. OH AND THE DLC IS A LIE. \"\"SERVARE VITAS\" - Conduct operations under the banner of the United States\\' most elite tactical unit, the FBI\\'s Hostage Rescue Team, with this unique DLC. \" I have to add this in here, because I feel that it\\'s relevant to the scummy-ness of the devs, and because I only just became aware of it; After the newest update, they removed the \"supporter edition\" from steam, no warning as far as I know. and now EIGHT of the TWELVE bullet points from the DLC are either a direct lie, or haven\\'t released yet. All of the outfits and the shield got changed to remove the FBI and HRT writing, the rifle is named differently, the gas-mask got changed for no reason, we\\'re still missing the coyote camo uniform, the supporter test branch hasn\\'t been used in many months (which honestly I like, but still it was promised) *The Soundtrack finally came out 7 months after they promised. Ok so they announced the DLC bundled with the supporter Edition - it\\'s a few cosmetics, and 3 maps, anyone can play the maps if you just join a host with the DLC, definitely not what I expected. People were making hype about other countries\\' SWAT teams and stuff, and this is really not living up to the price. I may have my problems with the game.. but learning about the supporter edition being changed made my blood boil. You officially launch the game and make zero mention about how you just screwed over people who payed you 80 EXTRA DOLLARS.If you want to just go massacre people in Coop this game can be fun with randoms... sometimes. It can also be extremely frustating - people dying constantly, not even trying to work together, killing everyone. 1 in 1,000 matches you\\'ll actually get a decent team that can properly go non-lethal, and those are the best experiences.If you want a good singleplayer SWAT game, this is not it. My recommendation would be to go get SWAT 4 on GOG (It\\'s not on steam) and honestly also get the SWAT: Elite Force mod, it\\'s just adds more content and fixes some bugs.',\n",

       "  'I enjoyed this game for a little while, but now that I\\'ve reached the midgame (third of five islands), I find there isn\\'t much to keep me interested. At its core, the gameplay boils down to catching fish so you can catch fish faster, while finding upgrades to catch other fish faster. What I hoped for from this game was a sense of uncovering the unknown, that Lovecraftian feeling of being incapable of comprehending the true shape of the world, and I just don\\'t experience that at all in Dredge.Here\\'s an example: When you find your first Aberrant fish, all mutated and unearthly and so on, you bring it to the fishmonger and he says (paraphrased, of course) \"Ah yeah these show up sometimes I\\'ll give you extra money for these\".The horrors of the unknown are less \\'lurking in the deep\\' than they are \\'lurking in the fish aisle at Walmart\\'. All the inhabitants of the game world are already used to the horrors of the unknown, and readily acknowledge that they\\'re there. \"Ah yeah the burrowing nightmare fish took me family crest, can you go get it?\" \"Ah yeah I made an electrical thingy that makes the unknowable tentacled beast from the abyssal deeps go away, can you go plug it in?\" There\\'s a cult of guys that make you do fetch quests to bring them mackerel.I can\\'t say that the fishing gameplay makes it worthwhile, either. Whether fishing or dredging, you\\'re going to be doing one of four fairly similar rhythm games that get old quite fast. You get a few special abilities, but they just make it a bit easier to avoid the dangers you\\'ve already learned to avoid by that point.I will say this, though: The art is phenomenal, and the gameplay is actually quite relaxing. If you\\'re looking for a chill game, maybe put on a podcast and fish, you might get something out of it. Otherwise, I cannot recommend Dredge at the current price point.',\n",

       "  'Over 1400 hours in Steam, and much much more over the launcher later, I have come to the conclusion:This game will entirely, and fully, change you as a person. It will destroy your mental stability, force your money out of your wallet while you\\'re still fresh, and then keep you playing as a sunken cost fallacy. The fun factor is very limiting, especially with the last updates, which add new stuff, yet make it nearly unreachable for players who don\\'t actively invest hundreds of dollars into the game. This is, as far as I know, the only game which ACTIVELY PUNISHES you for playing it. Even in battles with a K/D over 1 you will most likely lose SL if you are playing on high tier ... unless you buy a ridiculously overpriced vehicle or premium account. Even with those bonuses, the grind is extremely long. After literal years, I managed to grind only ONE tech tree, and not even in its entirety. Only to see my setups destroyed by BR changes.The economy is the worse of the worst. Vehicles are overpriced and take long to research, and then for some reason you have to research and buy modules that are already installed on your tank. You cant even properly repair or put out (more than one) fires without the modules. And everything takes long to grind and will empty your SL pool. But don\\'t worry, you can always buy it for gold and waste your hard-earned real money on something that would give you a barely playable vehicle.The balance of the game is also very bad. Sealclubbers in low tier, hackers in high tier. Vehicles with thermals fighting vehicles from the 40s-50s. People shootng through houses and hills. CAS with guided munitions team-wiping all allies. If you play CAS, you get pilot sniped from 20km. You respawn in a tank and die to a UAV. You spawn in a UAV, fly for 15 minutes to the battle, then die to AA. You get sent to hangar after a gruelling battle to see that you lost 12k SL as a result. And then you grind your teeth and push that \"To Battle\" button yet again, hoping for it to be different. It won\\'t be.Every good aspect of this game is covered up in its entirety by the bad ones. For every pro, there are 10 cons. All the graphics are good for is to see your plane/tank gracefully explode after yet another unfair death. Sometimes they have sales too, which allows you to buy vehicles not at \"ridiculously overpriced\" price but at \"highly overpriced\" price. Wonderful news for you, little Timmy, go get your mother\\'s credit card. You\\'ll get good if you buy this vehicle. Or the next. Or the next.Someday you will deinstall the game. And then you realized that it was for nothing. You wasted time and money on it, and you aren\\'t getting it back. All you can do is weep and try to move on, only for your addiction to return after a month or two, as you sigh, feed the snail your last 20 bucks for premium time, and begin the cycle again.If you are new, you\\'re free to have some fun. But if you don\\'t stop soon, you will not be able to later. If you\\'re an experienced player with a long playtime, I\\'m sorry. The snail giveth, the snail taketh away.',\n",

There are multiple big maps to enjoy and the scenery is some of the best I've ever seen. There is so much to see and explore but if every game comes it's flaws. If you are impatient with a short attention span, this game is definitely not for you. There can be long periods of times before you even see and animal and to maximise your success, you have to be slow as to not make any noise. After playing a while, you start to feel you have no end goal, but this is where the hunting lodge DLCs come in. They allow you to put animals you've hunted on display. There is no worse feeling than hunting your first albino deer and not being able to keep it. There is barely any lore except for a few story missions. After downloading the game, you get access to two different maps. If you want to access any others, you have to buy the DLCs or join someone through multiplayer, if the host leaves, you will be kicked after 15 minutes. Different maps have different animals to hunt which adds much needed variety to the game. This game is meant for solitary gameplay, even if it has access to a multiplayer. At the end of the day, i would only recommend this game if you are patient and looking for a chill, relaxed solo experience.\",\n",
       "  \"A truly sad experience. This release crushes all fond childhood memories of playing Civ and totally misses the mark on what it should feel like to play the series.I really tried to like Civ VII, but I can't.

The biggest money grab I have ever experienced, and bald-faced too: release a game that's clearly not in a good state, charge an insane price for it (people will buy it anyways, right) AND release the first DLC less than a month later. In retrospect, maybe we should have seen it coming.Instead of echoing all the other reviews that go into detail of what's wrong and what would be a path forward to start fixing some of the broken trust, I'll just say this: don't buy this game in its current state, and wait for a sale if you really want to play Civ VII.

The game itself is two steps ahead other games in terms of realistic vehicle simulation and its soft-body physics, so thanks to this it's unique. Driving cars is easy, just press W, but controlling them is a whole different story. Disabling automatic clutch, gearbox safety and playing on a manual gearbox using a steering wheel makes the game a lot harder to play, but that's the fun here. Tuning cars, especially with mods, is really fun and rewarding once you master it. I've never seen a game with this much car tuning capabilites, so that makes it stand out among others. Mods make the gameplay 10x better, as there are infinite possibilities to play the game. For now, there are only short scenarios and freeroam, that can get boring after some time, but a career mode is in the making since the game is in early access. The game in its current state is really fun as-is, and it will continue to expand in the future. The devs are updating and hotfixing the game frequently, so that is a big plus. Also, I hope BeamNG will get optimised more and more, because rendering and calculating physics is really CPU intensive, so playing with more than 1-2 cars will drop your framerate, especially on big maps, like West Coast USA. Overall, if you like cars you need to play this game, it's really fun once you get into it.\",\n",

       "  '2024 Update:The Final Shape is really good. Still wouldn\\'t recommend any new players to try this game though.Old Review:Ah, Destiny. I love so much about this franchise. The gameplay, shooting, jumping, throwing lots of grenades, dismantling guns.. Destiny is a franchise I\\'ve spent a lot of time in. I\\'ve accomplished some of the hardest achievements in the game. Low man raid encounters, solo flawless dungeon completions, Conquerer seals, etc. My honest opinion on this game is that it\\'s the best PvE FPS experience out there, ruined in multiple ways by problems that honestly shouldn\\'t be hard to fix or at least shouldn\\'t have been a problem for this long. I\\'ll start with the good:- Top tier gunplay and class feel- The in game movement is an underrated part of the experience in my opinion, each class has it\\'s own traversal tech if you really want to git gud- The raids and dungeons oh my god, they\\'re so awesome. Almost worth the time to invest into alone- Some of the coolest moments in the history of online gaming have happened in Destiny (just look up the Whisper mission)- The seasonal stories over the past year and current campaign as of writing this (Witch Queen) have great storytelling- Guns. So many guns. Almost a gun for every situation. Most of us in the community have actual real nostalgia for the muscle memory of some of our guns that we can\\'t use anymore. - Tons of content to check out for a new player- Regular weekly updates from the dev team on Thursdays (TWAB = This Week At Bungie)- On top of that, the dev team is pretty active on Twitter when the more unhinged members of the player base aren\\'t sending them death threats- The soundtrack is incredible- This is gonna sound like a meme but for real, the enemy AI in this game is pretty incredible. It can bug out sometimes of course but especially in harder content, different enemy types approach you different ways based on the weapons you use or the places you stand.- If you like the Diablo experience of just mowing down packs of enemies, D2 can fill that spot in your heartNow for the cons:- We\\'re all addicted. You\\'ll see this whole \"lol 5k hours I don\\'t recommend but I\\'ll log back in tomorrow\" jokes and honestly, there\\'s some truth to that. It\\'s a grindy MMO game. Some elements of it are designed to keep you playing.- All the classics are here: weekly drip-feeding of new content, bad communication on certain long-standing issues in the game for months and even years at a time, and a general level of jank and bugginess to the game that doesn\\'t really ever go away.- Certain parts of the game are massively undeveloped, but forced into the same grinds every season. Crucible, the main PVP mode in this game, only just got it\\'s first new map this season (4 weeks ago at the time of writing) in over 3 years.- Gambit, another main playlist, has been reworked like 4 times(?) since it came out and has somehow gotten worse each time. Also hasn\\'t had a new map since it came out, and has in fact actually lost content since it\\'s release.- The whole game runs on peer to peer servers. This isn\\'t super noticeable for the majority of content in the game, as most of the content in Destiny 2 is team based PvE content or story missions etc, but this makes the PvP just generally unplayable to a lot of people who try it. Crucible can be very fun but there\\'s always a layer of \"oh wow I just headshot that guy with my reticle at least half of my screen away from him\"- The cosmetic shop in Destiny 2, the eververse, is not one of the worst systems I\\'ve ever seen but it\\'s not super great either. It\\'s a pretty classic case of all of the best looking armor sets in the game, and virtually ALL weapon ornaments (weapon cosmetics in regular terms) being locked behind either a real money purchase or PRAYING it goes on sale for a currency you can earn weekly in game. Some cosmetics in the eververse haven\\'t been available for bright dust in years.- Sunsetting, a big process that happened about 2 years ago, removed a ton of content from the game that most of us paid real money for. Entire expansion areas, weapons, quests, etc. were \"vaulted\"- Bungie has a history of taking a really long time to fix more wide, sweeping issues with the game- Bungie\\'s current season system has a few good elements to it, but overall the way they\\'ve designed seasons has become pretty stale over the past 2 years or so- Bugs, man. Destiny 2 is always a buggy game, more than most in my experience. Most of us learn to live with the general jank, but it can be really frustrating sometimes. This season (Season of the Haunted) has been even worse than usual.- The main 3 playlists, Vanguard Ops (short PvE missions such as strikes and battlegrounds), Crucible, and Gambit, are roughly 40% or maybe more of your playtime each season, yet they haven\\'t updated them in any meaningful way in at least 3 years. - The pricing of this game. Realistically, D2 should\\'ve never been pushed as a free to play game. If you wanna access, and I\\'m not exaggerating, 95% of this game, you have to buy the expansions anyway. There\\'s no \"previous expansions\" bundle at a reduced price, and nowadays there\\'s even stuff like the 30th anniversary pack that gives you a dungeon and a rocket launcher for 30 bucks. It\\'s hard to get new players into this game when you have to open with \"well I know it says free to play but if you wanna realistically do the endgame content in this game (Trials/GM Nightfalls) you\\'ll have to spend like 200 dollars for all the expansions\"- The UI is kinda slow and bad. There\\'s a decent amount of item bloat so if you\\'re like me and hate having like 10 new flashing items in your inventory, you\\'re gonna spend a lot of time holding your F key to dismantle thingsDestiny 2 is a game that is super great at it\\'s core, but tends to shoot itself in the foot a lot of the time. It\\'s a conflicted game, with most of the dev time in seasonal content seemingly going towards releasing new things and rarely improving the content we spend the majority of our time grinding. It\\'s also a game that\\'s going through a big transition period right now. Currently Bungie has made it pretty clear that they\\'re developing D2 for the long term right now, so some things are just being pushed to the side for the overall health of the future of the game. I don\\'t know how much I believe that, but if you\\'re reading this and you know what I mean when I say Path of Exile 2, I salute you. One thing I haven\\'t really mentioned so far is that realistically, the best content in this game really requires a group of friends to enjoy at it\\'s fullest. I\\'ve been lucky enough to make some real long-term friends in my clan, and legitimately spend a lot of my time teaching new players how to do raids/dungeons/GMs. If you\\'re a solo player, many activities are either straight up impossble (raids) or they require significant time investment to complete solo (dungeons, GM nightfalls, etc). It\\'s a game all about building your vault of items so you have something for every situation. New weapon roll for this build, crazy armor roll with great stats, etc. This can take a long time and kind of creates this weird situation for newer players where they can just go months without getting a certain exotic weapon they need. To cut things short, I love this game and have obviously spent a lot of time with it. I can\\'t currently recommend it to newer players unfortunately. If you\\'re returning, maybe. The Witch Queen campaign on Legendary difficulty is some of the most fun I\\'ve had with my friends in this game in years, and the seasonal stories really do get better and better. If you have friends and the disposable income, give the game a shot. If you want the game to respect your time, look elsewhere.',\n",

You have the Generals system to beef your stuff up and whoop some serious ass. You. Yes, you. You reading this. If you have not bought this and you are a Command and Conquer veteran ditch your response to these comments, buy the game, and drop in for something really special.Thank you, Devs and Publishers, for bringing me something that I have wanted since I was knee-high to a grasshopper. Hats off and cheers to the soundtrack, too. That's some ♥♥♥♥-swinging energy there. Yes, I recommend this game, and I recommend the Deluxe. The track slaps hardcore.\",\n",

Instead of a blocky wonderland bursting with imagination, we get a soulless, corporate cash-grab that's as uninspired as a dirt hut built by a first-day player. And at the center of this mess is Jack Black, whose over-the-top shtick as Steve feels less like a character and more like a bloated, annoying caricature of himself phoning it in with the energy **** who ate too many pork chops and forgot what made his Bowser a good character.Where Super Mario delivered a tight, colorful romp with a villain you couldn't help but like to hate, Minecraft stumbles through a plot so thin it could've been scribbled on a 3x5 card with a fat sharpie. The live action gimmick is a disaster with corpulent Jack Black waddling around in a turquoise shirt against a green screen looks less like an adventure and more like a sad clown act at a kid's party no one showed up to. His constant mugging and forced musical numbers grate on the nerves, turning Steve into a flabby, loud distraction instead of the everyman hero Minecraft fans **** visuals? A garish mishmash of CGI and real world actors that clash worse than a creeper in a flower biome. The charm of Minecraft's pixelated freedom is buried under a generic 'save the world' story that feels like it was ripped from a dozen better films none of which bothered to star a Jack Black who seems to think yelling and flailing is a substitute for depth. Super Mario knew how to balance nostalgia with heart; this just shovels Easter eggs and tired gags into a pit and calls it a day. It's not just terrible it's a betrayal of everything that makes Minecraft special, leaving you longing for the Mushroom Kingdom instead of this blockheaded bore.TLDR - Jack Black ruined this movie and he is a bloated slob who phoned it in.\"]"

The only improvements are the amount of customization options and different skintones (because animal crossing was way behind in that aspect). Other than that, this is a step down from New Leaf. The terraforming, which was the most advertised feature, takes forever to get to. New Leaf lets you jump into the fun immediately, but here you have to wait soo long until the interesting part. I actually didn\\'t get to the terraforming because I put the game down a year ago and haven\\'t checked on it since. I\\'ve never lost interest in a game so quickly. Another thing that bothers me is how washed down and boring the villagers (or islanders) are now. I know there were people who didn\\'t like how some villagers were mean or sassy in older games, but you can\\'t deny that it added spice and made them feel like real neighbors (because not everybody will instantly love you upon first meeting in real life, obviously). But now all the villagers have the same cookie-cutter niceness, making them lose what made them distict. Even villagers with snooty and grouchy personality types lack the edge they used to have. New Horizons was only critically acclaimed because it released during the pandemic when everyone was dying of boredom. If it was released before or a year after the pandemic, I\\'d imagine people would\\'ve been much more critical of it.

       "  'Rust is the game you would wish existed back in the heyday of MMORPGS. Unforgiving PVP with consequences, where you can end up literally dominating the entire server. So, if you are the sort of person who enjoys tension in online PVP games, this should sound very good to your ears. And Rust honestly delivered in building that tense, insecure atmosphere in my first couple of hours. You start naked, with a piece of rock. You mine ores, destroy trees, build your first weapon and just try to survive. Any animal, any player is your potential murderer and players won’t hesitate to murder you and loot all your things.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe more I played though, the more I observed how this is not a game “for me”. Even when you are offline, your base can be raided and everything you have can be stolen. The community is beyond toxic, but that’s kind of expected for this sort of game. Servers usually reset weekly, biweekly or monthly, preventing many players from everlasting slavery and giving everyone a chance to start on equal terms. But that comes with a caveat: All the benefits you earned by your grinding will be lost no matter what.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlso, it should be mentioned that Rust offers some “lite” pay-to-win items. You can purchase things which appear to be only cosmetic, but do actually provide some gameplay advantages.\\r\\n\\r\\nRust is a good game for people with a very specific taste in games. It achieves what it’s going for, but ultimately is not a game most people would be willing to invest their time in, including myself. If you are a solo player, stay away from Rust. If you have limited time to invest in one game, stay away from Rust. If a mature community is important for you, stay away from Rust. But if this type of extremely unforgiving game is what you and your group of friends are looking for, you may actually love it.\\r\\n\\r\\n7.5/10',\n",

       "  'Elden Ring for PS5 can be overwhelming and difficult for new players due to its complex mechanics, lack of guidance, and high difficulty level. Unlike traditional RPGs that offer clear tutorials and structured progression, Elden Ring drops players into an open world with minimal direction. This can make it difficult for newcomers to understand combat mechanics, character builds, and exploration **** challenging enemies and punishing boss fights further add to the difficulty, requiring precise timing and strategy. Without a guided learning curve, many new players might find themselves frustrated by repeated failures. Additionally, the game’s intricate leveling system and vague item descriptions can confuse those unfamiliar with FromSoftware’s style.While the sense of discovery and accomplishment is rewarding, Elden Ring might feel unforgiving for beginners, making it a tough entry point into the Soulsborne genre.',\n",

Boring as hell, story is bad, missions are very repetitive, looting is weak, PvP is terrible and overall lack of content.

       "['Una obra de arte dirigida por Denis Villeneuve. Esta película es una de las mejores que he visto en este género. Sin necesidad de leer los libros, comprenderás a la perfección todo el contexto. El director busca deleitarnos con sus tomas cinematográficas y su espectacular sonido ambiental. Una obra de arte digna de un Oscar. El único problema que le veo, y por el que no le doy un 10, es el comienzo. Puede ser muy tedioso, pero se entiende perfectamente por qué.\\n\\nConclusión: Esta es una película que definitivamente tienes que ver en algún momento. El comienzo puede ser lento porque te da mucho contexto. No pierdas la oportunidad de verla.\\n\\nCalificación: 8.5/10',\n",
       " 'Took me a while to get into it, but as someone who has not read the Dune books, it truly feels like a book. I can see the influence and see how the book must have been like, I definitely plan to read the books at some point. Some of the decisions are a bit sub-par though. They should 100% have had a different cast. Yes, sure, they chose some good actors, but starring Zendaya in something like this is an absolute no. And I LOVE David Batista, but all I could think any time he appeared on screen, is Oh Look David Batista. You have to cast less known actors in big fantasy movies like this, because it just takes the watcher out of the movie, it takes you OUT of the beautiful world building when Zendaya with weird eyes appears on screen every so often. Completely jolts you out of the fantasy and back to \"Oh. Zendaya looks kinda weird in this movie.\" or \"haha look its David Batista\".',\n",
       " 'This might be my favorite movie !\\nDune (2021) is a sci-fi movie adapted from a roman directed by Dennis Villeneuve with Timothée chalamet as Paul Atréides  and Zendaya as Chani\\n\\nIn Dune(2021) Paul Atréides follows his very important and powerful family to the desertic planet of Arrakis gifted by the Imperium , where a very important ressource is collected and put on the market, but after an conspiracy and a betrayal Paul have to flee on the planet where he will met the native désert’s people, the Fremen\\n\\nThe actors were chosen perfectly and respected the physical descriptions given in the roman with the exception of some like Liet Kynes who was played by a woman. I also loved the makeup art on the Harkonnen family and the Eyes of Ibad\\n\\nThe film technique were amazing ! I think we cannot represent Arrakis better than they did , the lighting were very good on the desert and the pictures and ambiance were perfect \\nThe soundtrack by Hans Zimmer was flawless !\\nI really loved the costumes, from the Paul outfit on Caladan or Jessica outfit on the Arrakis arrival to the distille and Harkonnen Armor\\nAnd that’s why this movie won 6 oscars for 10 nominations\\n\\nDune explore theme like ecology power and colonialism.The film shows how the struggle for the rare ressource spice touch political, economic, and cultural conflicts, mirroring real-world tensions over oil and natural resources.  And my favorite theme is religion because its a big interest to me at this moment in my life, i love debatting about religion, learning about the story of religion so i absolutly loved the religion thème and everything its brings to the story \\n\\nFinally i really recommend to the movie watcher to try to read dune !!! Even though the adaptation is perfect in therm of cinematography i think the plot is very hard to fully understand and the movie miss a lot of scene and aspect of the story . So as a lover of Dune universe i fully recommend the book before watching the movie !',\n",

I can\\'t make comparisons with the books because I didn\\'t read them, so I don\\'t know how much the films differ from the original story. I can only make a comparison with the first film and I definitely liked more the characters of that one. I\\'ve found them having more personality. In this one I find the characters more \"flat\". It\\'s still not bad though, good special effects and interesting lore',\n",
       " 'A slogfest of a story, without any exciting moments to consider this movie memorable. The 1.5 stars are for the fact that the movie is undeniably beautiful with incredible sound. Feels like this movie was made to set up for the vastly superior second chapter.']"

But I can't speak too soon because I said the same thing about other musicals, and I ended up liking them. However, a reason why I felt gravitated and fully immersed into this film was because of its plot in general. It was so interesting to see one industry transition from one trajectory to another. We get to see Hollywood's transitional period from silent films, to full on singing and audio. I find it amazing how well this film was directed, from beginning to end, and overall the casting choices made. We follow two main actors who are transitioning with Hollywood itself, and trying to fit in into this new realm and era of movie making. Disregarding their fame and position, you cant take away how bad someone's voice is. Which is the case for this film. Overall, I enjoyed this film from start to finish. It was refreshing to watch, or I myself love to see transitional periods within an era or person. And of course it's more so like a behind-the-scenes film of film sets, which I liked even more. I would highly recommend this film to whoever has been holding back from watching it, or has yet to see it. Its fun, charismatic, and magnetic in general, a film you won't forget.

Muchas veces se comete el error de catalogar esta película como un producto del cine de terror o el cine gore, a pesar de tener algunos elementos de estos. Esta película es más bien una comedia que parodia el género de superhéroes y nos presenta a un monstruo que toma el rol del héroe cuando en el mundo de los superhéroes rara vez un monstruo es el héroe de la historia. El trabajo es bastante admirable por poseer elementos básicos de una película de explotación que ayudan a que la película sea muy placentera de ver. No es una película con un excelente argumento y las actuaciones claramente son exageradas acorde al humor de la película. The Toxic Avenger se las arregla para ser una película que se puede disfrutar por sus escenas de muerte y el humor que logra ofrecer momentos divertidos. Es por todo eso que The Toxic Avenger es la obra maestra definitiva de Troma que define lo que esta productora es. Mi calificación final para esta película es un 9/10.',\n",
