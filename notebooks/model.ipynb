       "['Oh dear Shingeki no Kyojin, where do I even begin. If you\\'ve talked with your friends about anime, then the couple anime that everyone talks about are Naruto, Bleach, One Piece, Dragon Ball, and... Shingeki no Kyojin. What\\'s the difference between Shingeki and the rest? Shingeki only has 25 episodes so far yet it\\'s on par in popularity with the other super long, Americanized anime. Why is it popular? Well that\\'s simply because it\\'s stunningly amazing. Those people that call Shingeki no Kyojin \"overrated\" may not have the same taste as me, and that\\'s perfectly fine, but in my honest opinion, Shingeki no Kyojin isone of if not the greatest anime to be made. It\\'s not popular for no reason.\\n\\nThe story is one of the most captivating stories I\\'ve ever seen. 100 years prior to the start of the anime, humanity has been on the bridge of extinction due to the monstrous humanoid Titans that devour humans. Now, present day in the anime, the remaining small population of mankind lives confined within 3 \"heavenly\" walls that are so tall and sturdy that even the titans can\\'t break in. The most outward wall was named, Wall Maria, the middle wall was named Wall Rose, and the most outward wall named Wall Sina. Unfortunately for mankind, a colossal titan, one that is even bigger than the 50 meter heavenly walls, breaks Wall Maria, allowing the other titans to rampage the city, thus leading to another massacre of mankind. During this massacre, our main characters, Eren Yeager and Mikasa Ackerman watch in horror as a horrifying titan rips their mother\\'s head off, then gobbles her up whole. Vowing that he\\'d one day avenge mankind and exterminate all the titans, Eren Yeager trains to become a survey corp, brave heroic soldiers who go outside the walls, into the plains in order to fight the titans. But we soon find out, that Eren is much more special than he seems, not only is he a brave warrior, but he\\'s also something else that could be the key to humanity\\'s survival, but could also be humanity\\'s destruction. \\n\\nMy 3-word thoughts on the anime: Epic, Dynamic, Masterpiece. The suspense build-up was absolutely amazing, yet there was still room for improvement; that shows just how epic this anime can get. The anime not only includes epic fights, but lots of dialogue, and for those of you that hate dialogue, I feel sorry for you people whom only watch for action. The anime includes lots of other things as well: there\\'s lots of half-hearted, hilarious scenes, as well as sad, tragic scenes. The anime certainly has a good amount of gore, and will break your heart frequently (if you get attached to the characters). Many characters end up getting gobbled up mercilessly while trying to protect humanity in ways that are quite *shivers*. Have I teared up in the anime? As a matter of fact, I have. \\n\\nCharacters was another area (alongside every area) that was Shingeki\\'s strongpoint. There\\'s a diverse variety of characters that fight for humanity for all different reasons. There\\'s trust, friendship, along with betrayals, and pains. There\\'s comedy relief among many characters, especially Sasha \"Potato Girl\" Blouse. There are characters that people can definitely relate with, such as Armin Arlert, who wants to do the right thing and protect his friends, but can\\'t seem to do much because of fear. Fear is something that haunts us all, and prevents us from doing things in life. Another character that people can somewhat relate with is Annie Leonhardt, who fights alongside humanity, yet fights opposed to humanity. What does that mean? Watch the anime. Why is she doing this? Because of her past scars, \"scars have the strange power to remind us that our past is real\" (watch to find out more). There were too many characters to development fully, but certainly the main characters were developed to their max. Levi is certainly a fan-favorite character, because of the fact that he\\'s cool, overpowered, badass, kind-in-the-heart, smart, straight-to-the-point, and most of all, hilarious with all his neat-freakiness. The main character, Eren Yeager is strong-hearted, and \"special\", but he\\'s still not strong enough to defeat the titans. How he develops is one of the most interesting things, in this interesting-things-packed anime. \\n\\nThe art and music can be described in one word: WOW! The art drawings were absolutely stunning! From the characters/titans to the setting of the story to all the equipment used in battle. The characters all had a unique aspect to them. The settings of the anime were beautiful. The cities, and walls looked realistic, the plains that characters dreamed of seeing made me want to run outside to see for myself how beautiful nature really is, and how humans under appreciate the naturality of nature. The 3-D gear was something that really caught my eye, and will certainly catch other people\\'s eyes as well. A new form of action that\\'s never been seen before. The characters would literally fly from rooftop to rooftop slicing their swords at the titans at high-speeds that keep the viewers eyes locked onto the screen at all times. The soundtrack in the anime was epic as shit. The openings speak for themselves, they do the anime justice. The openings were epic and certainly set the mood of what was to come from the anime. \"They\\'re the prey, and we are the hunters!\" The rest of the soundtrack in the anime was okayasgduyasgda AMAZING. How can one describe how amazing those German OSTs were. They fit in perfectly with the epicness of the anime, and certianly added tons of suspense to the 3-D maneuver gear action. \\n\\nOf course, I may be over-thinking things, but the anime certainly included some themes while creating this masterpiece of an anime. The aspect of being confined in an area, doing the same daily routine every day. People seek to be free, and to seek adventure. Watch for this. Another theme that the anime incorporated was that of the cycle of life. Humans, we steal animals away from their families, we kill them, we eat them. What\\'s so different from us, and the titans? The feelings of not being at the top of the food chain... Anyways, if you haven\\'t already watched this anime and you\\'re reading this review, then you\\'ve clearly been living under a rock all this time, and I definitely encourage you to watch this show even if it isn\\'t your style of anime.',\n",
       " 'I started to follow the manga after watching the anime and quite frankly I don\\'t see where and how the plot of Shingeki no Kyojin can suck, which in my humble opinion is awsome. You can understand the anime very well even without having read the manga. However, SNK isn\\'t understood by many because it\\'s a psychological manga .. SNK isn\\'t just a succession of empty and meaningless clashes and, of uncontrolled violence, stereotyped heroes who fight the bad (like Bleach). Here are shown the darkest sides of the human psyche with great mastery: the desire to be the best but can\\'t do it, thedifference between men, their different modes of action (just think about the speech when Eren was discovered in which they show the reactions of the inhabitants of the inner walls Rose) and their motivations, some of the questionable actions that seems to be made in the right and instead the Justice of others that superficially seems foolish and petty (such as the choice of sending refugees to rebuild the wall Mary), freedom and the fact that they don\\'t understand that what others inculcate to us sometimes are nothing more than mental cages. We stop at the appearances only because it suits us ( the walls is a symbol of that). Omitting the main and masterfully developed theme of \"Homo omini lupus\".\\nIn this anime there are no heroes! There are not brave men, without fear, that kill all the wicked. Here there are people who are fighting against their own fear and that sometimes they make it and sometimes not. The enemies aren\\'t the giants !Although the anime does not say from where they come from and I won\\'t do spoilers, it\\'s repeated several times that the enemies are the human beings with their fear (who have surrendered to the giants without doing anything, ignoring and accepting to live like cattle) and the walls! But no one notices that because it would be too challenging to make two questions and wondering: \"Why the walls ? Shouldn\\'t they be their salvation?\" and get an answer.\\nThe fact that many people aren\\'t well characterized, and that physically are not very different from each other isn\\'t a coincidence .. Isayama is putting on the same level all human beings, he is saying that we are all like that guy who shoots himself alone after he surrendered to fear, that we are all as Vernam (who during the attack fled from Trost ), that there is some of us who is better than others, but that we all live under the same fears, and even if we react differently, we act according to substantially the same nature. It still tells us that we might be the protagonists of our life, choosing our destiny, but only if we are ready to go beyond the stereotypes and mindsets that others impose to us, only if only if we work with all our strength. Because living by what others tell us, from what they show us, isn\\'t to live, but survive!\\nAnd in addition to all the various points of reflection that SNK has to offer (and there are many, not just those listed ), there is a plot full of twists and turns, the suspense. In short, it is a masterpiece. \\nThen, if you are used to an anime where the bad guys magically becomes good after a lesson or in which the characters acquire super powers from nothing or from old men who appearing in their minds... Well, ok ...... that ... that\\'s original and profound ........\\n(Hope my english was not so bad) :)',\n",
       " 'In the 80\\'s, Mobile Suit Gundam catapulted anime in Japan. In the 90s, Dragon Ball Z broke the mainstream walls while Neon Genesis Evangelion opened the doors to the now indispensable late-night anime slots in Japan. In the 2000s, Fullmetal Alchemist marked the peak of manga-to-anime adaptations while Code Geass & Death Note headed the class of those who introduced the new anti-hero genre. And now, in 2013, Attack on Titan has shaken the industry once again. Unless you\\'ve been living under a rock for the past 5 months, you should at least know what the story is about, and for the sake of staying spoiler free, I\\'m notgoing into details on the plot.\\n\\nBefore I wrote this review, I wrote a different piece moments after watching the first episode stating that Attack on Titan had all the potential to become a landmark anime, knowing very little of how true that statement would turn out to be.\\n\\nI have watched anime ever since I can remember. I have seen the very best and the worst that this industry has to offer. And I, like most of you, am very familiar with the relationship of manga-anime adaptation, which is the case of Attack on Titan. It is because of such experience and knowledge that I am able to say with so much confidence that Attack on Titan is the best anime series ever produced from any standpoint, at least, in the last decade.\\n\\nAttack on Titan is such a well-done product that it has all the key strong points we all dream every series could have. By this I mean the story, characters, animation, OST, opening/ending sequences, art, directing, narrative, character development, and, most importantly, the \"it\" factor. These are all present with \"A grade\" production values. \\n\\nFirst of all, I want to start with the OST. Simply put, Attack on Titan\\'s soundtrack rivals that of Rurouni Kenshin and Evangelion. Period. Don\\'t misunderstand, they are not similar by any means, they are simply equally as masterful. Check on the internet the impressions left by fans about the first soundtrack. And if you still don\\'t believe me, tweet Hideo Kojima (creator of Metal Gear series) and ask his take on it.\\n\\nThe OST is extremely important in this show because it allows you to feel the many epic moments that dwell in this 25 episode marvel. This is where the directing and narrative play a big role. For those of you who have seen Death Note (same director), you will feel an extra feeling of similarity with Attack on Titan, as the show relies heavily on its intense emotional scenes which you most certainly will feel the first 2 minutes of episode #1. \\n\\nIt is in these scenes where the golden cast of characters shine. I cannot stress enough how unique the characters are. You could say they are the cream of the many accolades that Attack on Titan has. I\\'m still amazed by the quality of voice actors that just seem to just pop out in this show. The voices of so many main characters from hit series come together in Attack on Titan to help provide that epic feeling you start to get once episode #1 ends. Note I emphasize the voice acting because it\\'s part of the anime but, obviously, not of the manga. \\n\\nAnother key strong point is the work and effort put on the OP/ED sequences. If you\\'ve come this far in my review then you most likely understand when I say that Openings and Ending sequences are crucial. They provide that extra excitement to the show. It\\'s definitely something not all anime series take seriously. Fortunately, Wit Studio took them seriously, and then came \"Guren no Yumiya\". The second opening, \"Jiyuu no Tsubasa\" is outstanding and marvelous in its own way and the second ending, \"great escape\", fuels that adrenaline rush of excitement you will get after those killing cliffhangers. Having said that, the first OP, \"Guren no Yumiya\", is simply epic. If there was ever something to describe as epic, it would be this OP. I am certain that as of today, it is the greatest anime opening ever. I\\'m amazed by the amount of attention it got on the internet and the hundreds of parodies derived from it. It was simply a treat to our eyes. The song. The animation in the opening. The sync between the two. Epic. \\n\\nYou won\\'t be skipping that opening.\\n\\nIn addition, an animation production is never as close to perfection without the animation and art being top class. Now, Attack on Titan has astonishing art, to the point where you are amazed of how far animation has come. The scenes where there is sunlight will leave you speechless. The animation, unlike the other aspects, is where some disagree. The only thing I have to say is I was extremely impressed throughout the whole show until I saw a certain scene in episode #11 where the 3D maneuver gear was used, and I was stunned. I was simply stunned. Then, of course, later episodes also take it to a whole new level, but you\\'re probably gonna be used to that quality of greatness by then.\\n\\nThat\\'s how ridiculously good Attack on Titan is.\\n\\nNow, like the characters, the story is mostly work of the manga\\'s author. This includes character development, which I believe is the key to the success and extreme popularity of the characters. Also, the story maybe the most original aspect of this series. Nothing you have seen before is in this show. Nothing. Much like EVA, Attack on Titan gives you a world of \"dystopia\", on-edge, and uncertainty, so full of potential that just when you think you have it figured it out, it turns around and leaves you speechless. \\n\\nOh, that will happen to you for the first time in episode #5. Guaranteed. \\n\\nFinally, even IF all these characteristics of an anime series are top notch, it won\\'t amount to its potential if it doesn\\'t have that \"IT\" factor. Some series have the \"IT\" factor without having all of these production values. They tend have 3 or 4 at most. Those become popular because they give out that feeling of \"amazing\". Gintama, the greatest gag series ever, comes to mind. Its anime doesn\\'t have overwhelming OST, or eye popping animation; it does have A class characters and A class story (among others), but that \"IT\" factor takes it to another level. Now, imagine having practically everything an anime series has to offer in A class value while also having that \"IT\" factor. Extremely rare. Eva rare. FMA rare. Attack on Titan is part of that elite group. This is why its popularity rose to highs only few series reach.\\n\\nThis is the first time I have ever written a detailed review of an anime series. I did it because this one deserves it. It\\'s The anime series of my adult era. I can now relate to those anime fans who watched Evangelion almost 20 years ago. They knew they had something special, just like we do now with Attack on Titan. \\n\\nIn conclusion, Attack on Titan is, of course, like MS Gundam, DBZ, EVA, FMA, Geass, and Death Note, not perfect. Like any other piece of greatness it does have its negatives. Having said that, when you add up the good and the bad, you end up with a landmark anime series that is currently shaking the industry with its mesmerizing, sensational, emotional, intense, and inspiring first season. Just imagine the wait and the hype for season 2. \\n\\nWhat kind of effect will Attack on Titan have on the anime/manga industry we love? Only time will tell...\\n\\nIn the meantime, this is simply the best anime series in the last 15 years. Enjoy.\\n\\nExquisite beyond words.\\n101/100.',\n",
       " 'Shingeki no Kyojin... Where do I start? In summary, Shingeki no Kyojin is a perfect anime to get somebody who loves action started on anime- I think it is literally the most mainstream anime ever made, and that is definitely not a bad thing. But with this comes downsides- ones not apparent to the viewer at first glance, but looking back on it after watching it around the time it first came out, definitely shine through. Shingeki no Kyojin starts off with a roar- the first 2 episodes explode right out of the gate with high-octane action that also leaves mystery to draw the viewer in. Whoare the titans? What is in the basement? Why is Eren\\'s dad so creepy? All this and more the viewer asks themselves as the end credits roll for episode 2.\\n\\nThen episode 3 and 4 jump in. It\\'s a training scene for Eren and his friends, and it\\'s dead slow in comparison. But that\\'s ok- it\\'s episodes like this that reinforce character development and get the plot rolling. And soon, the episodes with action will begin again, right? That High-Octane, bloody, gory action we\\'ve all been waiting for!\\n\\nWell, it does. But then shortly after, it grinds back to a halt. Why do I bring up the first 5 episodes out of all things to mention about Shingeki no Kyojin? Because it perfectly frames the pacing of the entire anime. First you\\'re baited with that sweet, bloody action that makes you just stare at the screen in amazement of the beautiful animation and heart-pumping soundtrack, and next thing you know you have to sit through an hour of people arguing over the same issue over and over before going back to the action. This would be fine and acceptable if it actually resulted in plot and character development going somewhere- but rarely this bickering between Armin and Eren result in anything productive.\\n\\nActually, Shingeki no Kyojin seems to show perfectly how to pull off the ILLUSION of plot and character development- Eren struggling with his inner demons despite somehow going back to square 1 every 5 episodes, the Basement which has been explicitly mentioned as having \"all the answers\" being completely forgotten about while the group goes out to hunt titans, and Armin rehashing what we already know to other characters every episode or two. All of this combined create a huge mess that on first glance seems like a deep and interesting story, but only through reflection of a different lens you begin to notice how shallow the pool you\\'re standing in really is. The characters are shallow, the story tries to go somewhere but the characters almost seem to prevent it from moving at all, and at some points the story tries to go to too many places at once, just confusing the viewer until the next trippy action scene kicks in.\\n\\nI like to compare Shingeki no Kyojin to a Michael Bay film. This also makes it easier to understand what I\\'m trying to say (and trust me, it\\'s not your fault- I have a hard time expressing what I feel in words sometimes).\\n\\nImagine Eren as Shia Labeouf, and Shingeki no Kyojin as a typical summer blockbuster by Michael Bay. Eren zips around the scenes of the movie, fighting bad-guys and pulling off amazing stunts with beautifully rendered graphics and an amazing ost- but then hardcut to Eren getting mad at himself and people around him but not actually advancing the plot for 1/3rd of the movie as the action grinds to a halt. Add some comedic relief (if you want a Bay comparison, the classic transformers out of place masturbation joke fits well) including possibly some potatoes after a traumatic scene and then slap on the illusion of having a deep plot and you have Shingeki no Kyojin. It\\'s a typical summer blockbuster! You go in, watch it, enjoy it, then leave and forget about it! I\\'m really not saying you\\'re not allowed to enjoy it because it\\'s shallow and noisy, I\\'m just saying you shouldn\\'t walk in expecting a revolutionary masterpiece of anime- which is what some critics are raising it up to be.\\n\\nSTORY- 4 : The story\\'s foundations are put up well, but the actual progression falls flat as no questions are ever really answered and the plot never seems to want to go in a single direction.\\nART- 9 : The art is amazing! There are some worse-off scenes and some animation glitches, but the art is one of the things that makes Shingeki no Kyojin stand out from the crowd. Even though I am not a huge fan of the anime itself, I have a massive poster above my computer of it as we speak.\\nSOUND- 10 : While the music and sound design is generic at worst, it is composed beautifully and always reinforces the mood set out by the show. I would highly recommend a download of the OST.\\nCHARACTER- 3 : Easily the worst part of Shingeki no Kyojin. Eren\\'s constant back and forth attitude and behaviour that never goes anywhere, Armin\\'s arguing with people that last an entire episode simply to recap what just happened on screen, Mikasa\\'s constant fight to try and save everyone and pull everything together: it\\'s just all poorly done.\\nENJOYMENT- 6 : While watching Shingeki no Kyojin, I certainly enjoyed it- but I wouldn\\'t say I enjoyed it the whole way through. Even while watching it, I noticed a lot of the fighting and arguing was going on too long, and let\\'s not forget the 3-5 episodes of riding on horses. But the scenes that were enjoyable- notably the fight scenes and the pivotal plot twists certainly left a lot to talk about and were enjoyable enough to at least somewhat wipe away two annoying characters yelling at eachother on horses for 30 minutes.\\n\\nOVERALL- 5: Watch it, get what you get out of it, but don\\'t walk in expecting the next amazing revolutionary anime. Expect a summer blockbuster.',\n",
       " 'Every once in a while, and even more frequently now than in the past, an anime appears that is completely and unequivocally shrouded in layers upon layers of hype and popularity from the anime community. It\\'s the show that\\'s on everyone lips, as well as everyone\\'s TV screens. In the Fall of 2011, The Future Diary created an exceptional level of hype that had not been seen for quite some time. When the Summer of 2012 rolled along, it was time for Sword Art Online to take the spotlight, and its own popularity grew toheights far beyond that of The Future Diary. Then, in the Spring of 2013, we were treated to what one could consider the Game of Thrones or the Breaking Bad of the anime industry in terms of sheer popularity; a show that completed engulfed the entire anime community, dwarfing even SAO in popularity, but is this anime truly worthy of the hype that it received?\\n\\n          Our story is set in an alternate universe where, 100 years prior to the events of the story, giant humanoid creatures known as Titans appeared and began consuming and decimating the human population, though with no apparent purpose for doing so. In response, the remainder of humanity built three enormous, circular walls to encompass their entire population and keep the Titans at bay. In this world, we meet three young children Eren Yeager, his adopted sister Mikasa, and their friend Armin, as they live out their peaceful lives in the southernmost city at the edge of the outer wall, Wall Maria. This soon changes, however, when a 60-meter Titan smashes through the main gate of Wall Maria, allowing Titans to freely enter the city and devour every human in sight, and forcing those who lived in the outer districts to retreat behind Wall Rose. During the chaos, Eren witnesses his mother being eaten by a Titan, and now he, Mikasa, and Armin have joined the military in the hopes of acquiring the skills necessary to take vengeance on the creatures that destroyed their lives.\\n\\n          This series, as a whole, has almost completely mastered the art of building suspense, mostly through the use of very long plot arcs. There always seems to be something constantly pushing towards a conclusion, but not actually getting there until several episode later, and that push factor creates a sensation of rarely ever wanting to stop watching for fear of the resolution being just after the episode you just watched. Additionally, this series is also a master of what I call the \"morale builder,\" something that Gurren Lagann has shown mastery of in the past, and there are dozens of moments throughout the series where, no matter how grim and horrifying the situation, it provides an uplifting or rallying feeling that both immerses you in the world its sets up and makes you root for our heroes to the bitter end.\\n\\n          Speaking of grim and horrifying, that comparison to Game of Thrones earlier was far from being an off-handed comment. By this I mean that I hope you don\\'t enjoy getting attached to characters, like I do, as you may find yourself curled up in a corner at some point. In the world of fiction, particularly in action series, there is a concept called \"plot armor,\" which basically means that characters who seem crucial to the plot\\'s progression and the show\\'s stability as a whole are protected from death or other nasty fates that might await them. In this regard, the plot armor for Attack on Titan is about as thick as a used piece of tin foil, and deaths of major characters are frequent and often times unrelenting. In regards to this, and on a more personal note, there are only three anime that have actually made me legitimately cry before. Two of them were KyoAni series, and the third was Attack on Titan. This show really does not care about who your favorite character is, and if you\\'ve made it this far without having had the major deaths in the series spoiled for you yet, then consider yourself lucky.\\n\\n          Unfortunately, there is one minor flaw with this series. There are certain points, especially at some slightly slower moments in the series, where its gets a little too over-dramatic, to the point of almost being ridiculous. This was especially noticeable during what is now referred to as the \"Boulder Arc,\" which encompasses roughly episodes 10-12. These moments are few and far between however, and are immediately drowned out once the hype builds back up again.\\n\\n          On the character front, for the sake of not getting your hopes up about the prospects of certain characters living, I\\'ll talk only about the three main characters I mentioned earlier, with the knowledge that the rest of the cast, while incredibly massive in scale, still serves as a stellar group of vibrant personalities and ideals to create a surprisingly organic social environment. As for the big three, we\\'ll start with Armin, who takes on the \"smart one/strategist\" archetype. While he is fairly generic and standard at the beginning of the series, we get to see him grow into being a more varied character at a constantly shifting rate, and his skills at strategy both on the battlefield and in complex conversations are practically unmatched, often allowing him the power to save the other two from the situations they get themselves into.\\n\\n          Next is Mikasa, who, for the majority of the series, is portrayed as being essentially flawless, taking on the role of the unstoppable badass Titan slayer fresh out of training who also makes time to coddle her adoptive brother, and this flawlessness is built up to the point of it almost being a flaw in itself. There are, however, a few quirks to her personality that make her feel more human, but at the same time make her seem even more distant. Her only notable \"flaw\" seems to be her undying loyalty and devotion to Eren, often throwing caution to the wind and bolting out against orders in order to make sure he\\'s safe. This also leads to some rather disquieting moments where her own sanity seems to abandon her and, to put it lightly, causes her to act excessively hostile towards anyone who means ill will towards Eren.\\n\\n          Finally, we have Eren, our stereotypical \"perseverance\" character whose sole motivation for the majority of the season is taking revenge on the Titans, and while this does seem like a bit of a gaping flaw for the show\\'s main character, it\\'s actually both understandable and sort of refreshing. His intense focus on his own rage and desires for revenge slowly consumes part of who he is, which becomes especially present at several points throughout the series that I can\\'t go further into detail on due to massive amounts of spoilers.\\n\\n         The animation was produced by Wit Studios, a new studio that serves as a surrogate of Production I.G. Regardless of its heritage, for a new studio to create such a massively impressive project is beyond incredible. Not only is the animation well-polished, but it also carries its own distinctive style, most notably in the fact that its characters are heavily outlined in varying thicknesses of black to make them pop out from the background. Speaking of backgrounds, the environments are shown to be incredibly rich and detailed despite how unvaried they may appear on the surface, and the action shots give us plenty of different perspectives on this environment. As for the action itself, Wit Studios has no qualms at all with handing out incredible fight sequences by the barrel-full via an in-world tool used by humanity\\'s military known as 3D Maneuver Gear, allowing us to break away from standard ground combat and enter the world of high-flying intensity, with soldiers bolting off of every building in sight, into the air above them, and landing blade-first on the neck of a Titan. On course, all of these brilliant combinations of animation are to be expected from Araki, who has already brought us both the intensely stylized atmosphere of Death Note and the blood-pumping action of Guilty Crown.\\n\\n         The dub was produced by FUNimation, and, as someone who watched the subbed version first, I have no problems whatsoever recommending this dub. From heavy-hitting new favorites like Josh Grelle and Matthew Mercer to classic icons like Vic Mignogna and Caitlin Glass, Funimation has pulled out all the stop to create one of the best dubs this side of 2010. Grelle shuffles between nervously unstable and frantically stern for his portrayal as Armin, and Trina Nishimura pulls off both Mikasa\\'s warmth and ferocity to near perfection. My only notable flaw with the dub is Bryce Papenbrook as Eren. To be fair, this is definitely Papenbrook\\'s best performance yet, due in no small part to Mike McFarland\\'s exceptional voice directing, but he does still tend to get a bit \"Bryce-y\" at some points and lets his excessively angsty style boil over, which is a rather dangerous idea considering Eren\\'s character. Overall though, this is a minor blemish on an otherwise excellent dub.\\n\\n         The music was composed by Hiroyuki Sawano (Aldnoah.Zero, Kill la Kill), and this soundtrack is definitely one of the best to come out of anime in a long time, based in heavy orchestrations and laced throughout with electronica and hard rock. From the bombastic explosions of \"E.M.A\" and main theme \"Attack on Titan\" to the insert tracks of \"The Reluctant Heroes\" and \"Doa,\" this soundtrack dabbles in the art of perfection on all fronts. If it seems like I\\'m being much more in-depth with the soundtrack than usual, it\\'s because I\\'ve actually purchased the soundtrack on iTunes and have been listening to it practically non-stop, and I highly recommend making this purchase as well. Both opening themes, \"Guren no Yumiya\" and \"Jiyuu no Tsubasa,\" were performed by Linked Horizon and give us massive eruptions of heavy rock combined with brass and vocal choirs (and on a quick aside, I\\'m one of the few people that actually preferred the second theme more than the first, though the first still kicks all sorts of ass). The first ending theme \"Utsukushiki Zankoku na Sekai\" by Yoko Hikasa gives us a rolling ballad to play us out of each episode, while the second ending theme \"great escape\" by Cinema Staff blasts through with a heavy rock track. Additionally, all of these tracks except \"great escape\" are available for purchase on iTunes, purchases that I also highly recommend.\\n\\n         Overall, Attack on Titan is simply an incredible experience, combining high-flying action that could even make ufotable nervous with a dark and nearly-overwhelming sense of fear and desperation, and this anime is more than deserving of the hype that it receives. However, as it stands right now, on November 4, 2014, the series is incomplete, and there has been no announcement of a second season yet. I highly doubt that this second season will never come however, and it has been reported that the original manga is planned to be finished in about four years’ time (which actually isn\\'t that much material for a monthly manga). In the meantime, there will be plenty of specials and spin-offs to keep us satiated until season 2 is officially announced.\\n\\n          Attack on Titan is currently licensed by FUNimation and is available from them for both streaming and purchase.',\n",
       " 'Attack on Titan is a particularly unique case for me. As such, my review needs to be broken up to properly analyze it. Story: Attack on Titan has an absolutely astounding setting. The sheer idea behind the setting, the exposition pieces, and the initial plot elements held the potential for it to be one of the best action anime ever. From the first three episodes, I could see how someone could believe this would be that one anime that is just absolutely amazing. It simply becomes disappointing as things continue. Long story short? The start is absolutely amazing. It\\'s powerful. It\\'s grabbing. It does everythingan introduction should do. The problem after that stems from the plot slowly becoming painfully predictable and a personal dissatisfaction with the protagonists in place as well as the decisions of various members of the cast completely destroying the story\\'s credibility at times. \\n\\nArt:\\n\\nArt is completely subjective. I would not actually judge art based on someone\\'s own opinion. You would really have to see it for yourself to deem whether it is \"good\" or not. As for me, it seemed fairly mediocre. The effort is there, but something with the art style simply does not jive with me. The settings are well done, but the characters are quite bland. \\n\\nSound:\\n\\nFinally. This is what I can praise Attack on Titan for. If anything, this series\\'s soundtrack deserves to be remembered. It is excellent and its execution throughout the anime was not only strategic but tasteful. The tracks range from dark and depressing to powerful and moving pieces designed for a battle against a completely hopeless situation. In my opinion, the music in and of itself is the true beauty behind this anime. \\n\\nCharacters: \\n\\nThe main protagonist Eren Jeager is heavily set on his goal to a fault. Some call this good writing, but given the setting, it actually works against the story and its credibility. It is literally almost difficult to not find the main character\\'s obsession with revenge nostalgic and downright hilarious. If you don\\'t like avenger-type characters, you will despise Eren beyond imagination by the time the story is over. The worst part? He finally starts developing three-quarters through and goes right back to the bratty child he was in the first few eps. The same can be said of Mikasa. This anime is one of the few to portray women with some form of decency, but Mikasa\\'s obsession with Eren is a pretty sad window of how the author wants people to worship his poorly-designed protagonist. To boot, Mikasa literally has no flaws other than her obsession with Eren. No character flaws. No ability flaws. Her only real flaw is her obsession with Eren, which usually only winds up helping them, not causing them problems like it should. Your only real likable protagonist? Armin. He is one of maybe three characters we really see that has a solid character, solid flaws, and solid development based on those flaws and his interactions with other characters due to the plot. In all honesty, Armin should have been the main protagonist. \\n\\nEnjoyment:\\n\\nNow we move onto enjoyment. Despite vehemently despising roughly eighty-five percent of the cast, I enjoyed Attack on Titan. Is it a great action anime? Sure. Definitely! Is it realistic? Sad to say, but no it is not. Is it the most well-written anime ever? Astronomically far from it. If you\\'re looking for an action anime to sit down and enjoy, this is a wonderful choice. If you\\'re looking for an action anime with a strong plot and emphasis on lovable characters, I recommend pretending that you never heard the hype and staying far away from this anime. \\n\\nWith a heavy heart, I cannot give the anime anything higher than a 5/10 in good conscience. It had oodles of potential, but an irritating cast, some half-baked plot elements, and predictability ruined it. Mediocre at best.',\n",
       " 'So what on earth? What have I done? How am I not able to feel the stun?... I will write about \"Attack on Titan\" here; but yeah, I\\'m no fanboy trying to endear myself to mainstream now or in the longer run. I turned towards this show unbiased considering its popularity at highest. I wanted to see if this action show at least conveys more meanings than being a bloody feast.But in the end: people and story at its driest.\\n\\nSo hundreds of years ago, the humankind\\nis letting itself be completely confined\\nby dim-witted looking titans there\\ninside a 50-meter wall ensnare\\nand is now searching for ways to get behind.\\n\\nThen suddenly, a 60-meter giant attacks\\nand many more titans are making their tracks.\\nThe wall can\\'t hold it anymore\\nand so the humans are fighting another war.\\nTheir enemies won\\'t give them more time to relax!\\n\\nThe first few episodes are quite intense,\\nexperiencing human\\'s crumbling defence,\\ngetting their normal lives torn up again,\\nhaving to survive in a diminishing den,\\nand nearly losing their last kind of sense.\\n\\nWe follow Eren, who has to sustain\\nhis mother\\'s loss, indeed a great pain.\\nHe wants to kick some titan\\'s ass\\nand finally falls into the shounen mass,\\nalways acting like tightened by an angry chain.\\n\\nAccompanied by one of the few\\nmore normal humans, Mikasa, whose true\\nintention is to save her Eren\\nand so she\\'s getting ears more barren\\ndespite her strength she would rather sue.\\n\\nThe third in league, weak fair-haired Armin, stays\\nthe cowardly one with a frightened face.\\nHe tends to think far more than others\\nbut is mostly hindering his brothers.\\nHe needs lots of time to realise his place.\\n\\nSo maybe you would think that some other\\nguys inside these walls don\\'t try to bother,\\nbut instead act more heroic inside this hell.\\nYou see, Commander Levi\\'s the only one memorable;\\nhe wouldn\\'t even trade his tenacity for his mother.\\n\\nAll in all, these characters just won\\'t try\\nto develop properly and we ask why?\\nWhy haven\\'t they used episodes five to twelve\\nto let them build some features or delve\\ninto their motivations or what they go by?\\n\\nSeriously, you won\\'t remember any other names.\\nThey die like flies and only the main remains.\\nSo I really wondered the whole time where\\nthe more seasoned soldiers would deign to dare\\nto get into the fight, but you know what it claims...\\n\\nAnd then, the probably most important thing:\\nWhat are the titans?

       " 'I started watching Shingeki no Kyojin a year ago, almost to the day that I am writing this. So I figured I would write a review on what has grown to be one of my favourite series of all time. What I\\'ve noticed is that people tend to be very split about this anime; you either love it, or you hate it. Clearly, in my case, I love this entire series (the show, the manga, the side-stories, etc.) Now onto the actual review. Story: 9 At its core, Shingeki no Kyojin is something that we have seen many times in the past: humanity is being attacked, therefore wemust defend ourselves. Many, many iconic shows start from this format. However, SNK (as I will be calling it for the rest of the review) takes this simple plot point and expands it into something very, very unique. We have the Titans: giant, humanoid creatures set on devouring humans. Because of the Titans, humanity has been driven behind three walls, with the population dwindling to less than 1% of our current population. \\n\\nEach and every single plot point in this series is completely thought out and executed stunningly. There are so many twists that you won\\'t be able to see coming. Hell, check out episode 8- you\\'ll be shocked. Even the filler is thought out, and has important significance to the main story. The story of SNK goes even further in the manga. At the time of writing this review, there has been 59 chapters released, and we are just only starting to scratch the surface of this world.\\n\\nLike most things out there, SNK does have its flaws. But the flaws are so minuscule that it\\'s very, very hard to notice them. The brilliant storytelling of this series completely blew me away from episode 1, which is why it deserves a near perfect score.\\n\\nArt: 9\\nIf you have read the SNK manga, you\\'ll know that the art, while it is good, isn\\'t amazing. The anime cleaned up all of the character designs, leaving us with a beautiful result. While there were some minor changes in characters (ex Eren\\'s eye colour, Levi\\'s physique, etc,) the anime designs did stay pretty true to the original material. The designs match the characters\\' personalities completely, which is something that not a lot of shows can brag about.\\n\\nAnd the animation is breathtaking. Every single sky we see, the birds eye views; the scenery in this anime is absolutely stunning. And the animation for the characters and their situations is pretty great, too. To me, this is digital animation to the finest degree. But again, as is the case with most shows, SNK does have some animation flaws. For example, in one episode, the same frame is shown about three times. The characters can also have a case of \"far away face\", but that is pretty common. Again, these flaws in animation are pretty small, and are barely noticeable when you are watching the show. They do not take away from the rest of the show.\\n\\nSound: 10\\nThe score for SNK was done by Hiroyuki Sawano. If you don\\'t recognize his name, he also composed the score for things like Kill la Kill, Ao no Exorcist, and more recently Aldnoah.Zero. If I could use any one word to describe the sound of SNK, it would be flawless. The score matches every scene perfectly, mixing electronics with more orchestral pieces. If you don\\'t have any interest in watching the show, I would still suggest you download the OSTs. The sound for this show blew me away. Even the background noises, the additional sound FX- they were all done to the utmost perfection.\\n\\nThe openings and endings for SNK were all absolutely amazing. It\\'s no wonder that Guren no Yumiya in particular has landed on many \"top 10 anime openings\" lists. The songs will get stuck in your head, and refuse to leave. In my case, they have not left in a year, and that\\'s something that is very hard to do in my case. Just check out the OPs and EDs online; you\\'ll be amazed at how great they are.\\n\\nAnd the voice acting is nothing to laugh at, either. With many shows that I\\'ve seen, I\\'ve noticed that the voices don\\'t match with the characters. Either the voice is too weak, too bold, meek, etc- this is not the case with SNK. Each character is voiced perfectly; each voice matches the personality of the character. The passion put into the voice acting of the show is nothing to laugh at. The voice actors were able to portray each and every line and emotion perfectly, which is something very hard to do. The dub is a different story (but we don\\'t talk about the dub....)\\n\\nCharacter: 9\\nThis is where most people decided whether they love or hate this show. To be fair, the characters in SNK can sometimes seem a little extreme with their personalities. However, I love them. For example, the main character Eren can seem very angry, very passionate. Some people hate this. They think he\\'s just a trope amped up to the extreme. In my opinion, Eren\\'s character was done perfectly. His \"extreme\" emotions fit his personality up to a T. \\n\\nThe personalities of each character in this show are fleshed out near perfectly, in my opinion. Again, some aspects can seem extreme, but that is part of the enjoyment of this series. Not one character is deemed as \"perfect.\" They each have their flaws, which makes them seem very human and realistic. As the story goes on, each point in each characters\\' personality is explained in detail, even if it seems unimportant initially.\\n\\nEach character in this series serves a purpose. The main characters, the main supporting characters, the regular supporting characters- each and every one of them is important. There is a lot of death in this show, but every single death we see is important to the story and the character development. And while some deaths may seem insignificant, they really aren\\'t. The entire emotional journey of this series stems from the characters, and SNK has pretty powerful ones.\\n\\nEnjoyment: 10\\nI\\'m not a fan of blood and gore. Really, I\\'m not. There have been several shows, live-action or animated, that I have had to drop because of their content. When a show like SNK, which has copious amounts of both blood and gore, can become one of my favourites, you know that it is amazing.\\n\\nEvery single episode of SNK had me captivated. Even the filler ones. Each and every episode was an emotional journey from start to finish. Waiting for the episodes to air every week was torture, because I so desperately wanted to see everything happen (even if I had already read the manga.) I loved every single episode, even the OVAs that have been released. Each release had me on edge, with both the show and the manga. Nothing was dull; everything was riveting.\\n\\nOverall: 9\\nThere is a reason why this show doesn\\'t score perfect. It has its flaws, as everything does. But there is also a reason why it scores so high.\\n\\nShingeki no Kyojin was one of the most popular, if not the MOST popular anime of 2013. There is a reason for this. There is a reason why so many people watch, read, and enjoy this series, even if they\\'re not into anime or manga. There is a reason why there are copious amounts of fan works for this series. There is a reason why so much merchandise has been released. There is a reason why so many people cosplay characters from this series.\\n\\nLike it or hate it, you really can\\'t deny how popular it is. I personally love everything about it. Keep in mind that this is only my opinion; other people will tell you different things. But to me, Shingeki no Kyojin is stunning.',\n",
       " \"Let's get straight to it! Shingeki no Kyojin is an incredibly gripping, action packed show, and it is certainly capable of converting non-anime watchers. When you begin to understand the plight of humanity versus the titans, you'll quickly begin to realize that this is a show of epic proportions - essentially it is an inter species war: and violence comes hand in hand with this theme, so squeamish viewers might want to look elsewhere. The show is incredibly engaging, and intense because the combat animations are executed perfectly, giving a really personal front row seat throughout. Not only this but peril is constantly a reinforced aspectof the anime, and what's scarier is the accurate scale of death that isn't afraid to engulf those that the viewer has become connected to.\\n\\nI'm liking this logical order, because with death brings me to the next area i'd like to explain: Drama! Oh boy you'll be astounded by the dramatic, emotional and often angry outbursts of the characters. I personally would rank Shingeki no Kyojin highly in all of its presentation methods.\\n\\nBut that's not all, because in addition to being well presented, violent and dramatic, the show still then has the drive to steer you into corners via breakthroughs in the story. Another beautiful aspect of the show is that although the context would say that humanity had been surviving for over a century, the titans are still a great mystery to the present characters, therefore putting you (the viewer) on the front line for discovering more!\\n\\nDespite how i'm in awe with so many parts of the anime, the story if i'm honest is a bit too linear, as in i don't think enough goes on behind the scenes of titan combat. The plot summary introductions are also a pain due to their repetitiveness, it really is easy to pick up the story line behind the show, yet to an extent where it almost feels like it's been dumbed down.\\n\\nNevertheless, i agree with the masses, this popular anime lives up to its reputation, and you really must see for yourself!\",\n",
       " 'This anime made my mouth open wide for longer than 5 seconds more than a handful times. This is the type of world where more people get killed than the entirety of the A Song of Ice and Fire series. It exists in a timeless universe – not in the past, present or future of our world, but in a pocket universe where Titans existed long before the existence of machines. In this world, machines were not invented to improve humanity’s lifestyle, but for the continuous existence of humanity itself. There’s lots of shouting (especially from Eren), lots of action, lots of character development, and lotsof tears. My friends weren’t kidding. I felt like my ear drums would break from all the intense shouting. I think my mind is forever scarred, what with how everyone got crushed like ants all the time. And my heart has become immune to all other fictional deaths, what with all the deaths I’ve experienced just from this show alone.\\n\\nIt teaches you a lot about what it takes to be a soldier, a survivor. Constantly, people have to be reminded to “FIGHT!” Some lines are repeated all over the anime that it kind of becomes engraved into your head and heart once you’re done with it.\\n\\nIt’s the kind of anime that sticks with you, the kind that leaves you with phantom faces with phantom voices following you around, making you feel as if you’re still living in that universe, even after you’ve told yourself that you’re done with it.\\n\\nThe concept of the villain, and of the world itself, is scary and genius. First off, the villain – the Titan – is basically a stupid giant human cannibal.\\n\\nUnlike other villains, it doesn’t want revenge. It doesn’t want world domination. It doesn’t want power. It doesn’t need to eat. It has lived a hundred years without eating humans. But it is all it ever eats. It doesn’t eat animals. It wants only one thing – and this is just a theory, but it’s one that I can side with, and one that I love the most – to annihilate the existence of humanity.\\n\\nSecond, the fact that it looks human. It is, in every aspect, a human being, except for the fact that it doesn’t have two things; sexual organs, and a conscience. Countless times, characters had their feet rooted to the ground, unable to fight, and I think it’s because the image of a gigantic human biting off a human’s neck is just too fascinatingly cruel that they feel they cannot look away.\\n\\nThe world itself is scarier than the world of the Hunger Games. And I think what makes it scary is the fact that humanity has never won against the Titans, ever. For the past who-knows-how-many-years, Titans have been eating humans.\\n\\nThe humans in this world pretend that they have a system.\\n\\no matter what plan the humans think of, no matter how determined every single one of their skilled soldiers are, they will still be crushed in less than a second without remorse, without even a body to prove that you have existed. This is their anarchy, their ‘chaos’.\\n\\nEvery single man, woman and child in this world lived with losing a loved one as a social norm. It’s a dark fact I’d like everyone to consider. Everyone is already dead, in everyone else’s eyes. That’s what’s sad about this whole thing – even the humans think of other humans as just tiny insects with no importance. But it’s also beautiful, because sometimes, sometimes a character sees through that corrupted notion and calls everyone else out on it, making us realize it along the way too.\\n\\nSo you have a dark world, and an even darker society. Combine that with real-life everyday problems like corruption in the system, hierarchy in social status, differences in privileges and human rights and what do you get? Awesome badass characters who naiively try to fight against it.\\n\\nThe differences in character personality is great, too. There are a few who are extremely righteous, but most of them just really don’t care. They feign an act of indifference, but all for different reasons. But the fact that they had grieved over the death of a loved one united them.\\n\\nAnd I think that’s brilliant. These clashes of personality, and this unity for one tragedy, has bonded them together, and changed them greatly. You get to see how much they have grown in a span of 5-7 years. That’s something I don’t usually see in anime.\\n\\nYou also get to witness the amazing 3D Maneuver Gear.\\n\\nThis made the whole world look kind of sci-fi, but also, kind of not. The 3D Maneuver Gears are as close as we can get to a ‘high tech’ fictional gadget in this world. Every other man made thing you see in the anime is pretty mundane. But the function of it makes the people actually fly. It’s a pretty brilliant concept, and I like how something as complicated as that is a seemingly-ordinary thing for them. Plus, it makes the animation really cool to watch. You gotta respect the amount of effort (and physics, I bet) put just to make sure each maneuver looks even just a little legit.\\n\\nThe music is amazing, too. There were some points where I gaped like a fish because “wHaT just happened omg” and the music dramatically intensified my feelings. So kudos to that! The animation was splendid, hands down. Especially, like I said, with the whole 3D Maneuver thing.']"

       " 'original_text': [\"Hmm well, to start off, Ouran Highschool Host Club is so far the best anime I've ever watched, and manga I've ever read. Story: Okay, I gave the story a nine because yes, I DO think it is pretty original and all, but I just bought 'Hana Kimi' today and I find the two concepts a lot alike. (Except in Hana Kimi no one knows she's a girl) Honestly, I found out about this anime because I saw an AMV with it and it looked really hilarious. Art: Simply amazing. In all the animes I've seen, I've never seen such pretty art. Yes, I mean pretty. Theymake their boys look so princely, and the girls so soft! Everything so...well....fancy! I guess that's what they get though, for going to an upper high class institute hah xD Honestly, I've never seen a style come close to this. The backrounds are just amazing. When they show you the whole school, it really takes my breath away! It has really inspired me so much in my drawings.\\n\\nCharacters: \\nI find all of the characters extremely unique. Each of their life stories are so interesting, and sometimes tragic. Honestly, I don't know how anyone could forget any of the Host Club members' names. The thing is, even the twins who are practicaly the same, are so different at the same time. Even if you think the characters are bad at the beggining, they eventually grow on you. For example, I really really hated Tamaki when I started the seriese, yet now he is my third favourite character! All of them are really funny,in my opinion. \\n\\nEnjoyment: \\nSeriously, I have never laughed so hard while watching anime. Bisco Hatori, the maker, must be like, a master mind comedian in disguise or something...\\nThis show is really moving too, sometimes just the things they say, the situations, and relations. You could watch this anime over and over again without getting tired of it.\\n\\nOverall:\\nOverall, as I said earlier, this is the best anime I've ever watched. Its combinations of Romance, Comedy, School, and Drama is simply amazing.This is deffinatly an anime everyone one should watch, and I think most people regardless of gender would like.\",\n",
       "  \"May contain light spoilers... Death Note is a solid series with some brilliant moments in it, but some equally ridiculous ones too. Most of it is pretty much the same thing: a long-ass cat-and-mouse game that keeps taking turns going for and against the two lead foes. Early on it's rather boring as you watching everything take it's time to pick up, and there's even an episode that consists almost entirely of two characters wandering around aimlessly that get real boring real fast. Once the big twists start happening they're mostly impressive, but you almost get kind of sick of them after they keep coming overand over and they start to get a little repetitious. The last few episodes leading up to a major character's death are really good, but after it actually happens the plot goes off the rails and just winds up repeating a good portion of everything that's just happened before. But despite getting rather ludicrous at the end, the finale is a good payoff.\\n\\nThe silliest thing about it is whenever the big, epic music starts playing everything is made out to be SUPER intense and over-the-top...and most of the time it's just someone writing down names, so instead of seeming super epic it just comes off as painfully cheesy.\\n\\nThe characters are generally pretty stiff and don't change much, and when they do it's normally pretty sudden and doesn't have much, if any, build-up to it. One of the exceptions to this seems to be Aizawa, who is one of the few characters for whom you actually get a glimpse into the outside life of, even if it is small. L is impressively intelligent and deductive, but outside of that there really isn't much to him. Light is a sociopath with a god complex and anytime that might change it just turns out to be part of a monster scheme. Near and Mello are really forced characters, and Mello doesn't even stay the same character in his short stay and ends up becoming a mess of identity (he's seriously, like, three different people in his short time on the show). When it comes down to it, the best and most interesting characters in the show are the Shinigami.\\n\\nI'm not a huge fan of the overall artistic style and the general presentation, and the crazy colour changes get old after a while, but it's nothing too off-putting.\\n\\nIn the end, though, I did enjoy the series. I can see why it's so popular, but I do think it's rather overrated.\",\n",
       "  'Everyone really be out here hating on this show for its depiction of a hopelessly perverted protagonist and a morally questionable theme whereas I’m just over here enjoying the heck out of this cute yet cringy anime. Rent-A-Girlfriend is the latest installation in the ever popular RomCom genre. Anime of this nature are often criticized for generally following similar structures and plot progression, so each individual one often comes with its own “quirky’” gimmick in an attempt to set itself apart from the crowd and draw in some intrigue. The one in this anime happens to revolve around rentable girlfriends. That’s right weebs of culture!No longer do you have to suffer through complicated emotions in a fruitless attempt to find true love. All you need to do is click a few buttons (and have enough money to pay her of course) and boom! Instant girlfriend for a day. And the bonus? She’s super cute and will have a perfect personality. Since, you know, she’s payed to be like that. This is the situation that protagonist Kazuya finds himself in after getting dumped by his first ever girlfriend and fapping away his sorrows. And it comes to the surprise of no one that Kazuya and his rental girlfriend Chizuru get caught up in an aWkWArD misunderstanding that causes them to fake a real relationship and lie to their friends and family while truly falling in love along the way…yeah, you get the picture. \\n\\nSo it’s no secret that asides from the gimmick, the narrative is pretty plain. The show goes just about as you’d expect. Kazuya and Chizuru have their share of awkward and funny moments. Other girls, Mami the masquerading home-wrecker and Ruka the eternally ignored short haired girl who’s super dedicated, come into the picture to add a little drama and humor. There’s also this girl named Sumi who makes an appearance in the second to last episode, which I thought was a weird decision to include her so late by the directors. Kazuya also has two friends and a grandma who surprisingly get involved in the narrative, which I liked. \\n\\nWhat’s probably the most unique aspect of Rent-A-Girlfriend is the sheer amount of times that it made me cringe. It got so bad that I actually paused the show several times and had to tell myself that it’s just fiction, there’s no need to feel this way. But you know what’s funny? I actually liked this approach. It was clearly intentional by the author and gave the show a little more flavor. I mean, I cared enough to actively facepalm and feel mild discomfort whenever Kazuya did something stupid (which was probably every episode), so that definitely has to be a positive, right? \\n\\nThe plot certainly isn’t the focal point of Rent-A-Girlfriend, but it’s solid enough to let the show’s most important aspect take the spotlight…the girlfriends.\\n\\nThree of the four main girls in the show start off as rental girlfriends. Chizuru is the first, and she’s the type of girl who can easily change her personality to fit the mood. She’s also a pretty dependable person and provides good support to Kazuya. Some might say that she acts a little TOO nice to him considering the crap he pulls sometimes, but you gotta remember that the guy saved her life and simps for her like crazy with many a cash donation, so her behavior totally makes sense. Mami brings some nice early tension and drama before disappearing from the show entirely until the very end. Ruka ended up being my favorite character because of her great energy and personality. Too bad the short haired girls almost never win. And Sumi…is cute. Yeah, there’s not much else to say about her honestly. \\n\\nNow one aspect of the show that might turn off viewers is the apparent glorification of the rental girlfriend industry. Each of the girls has a reason for entering the business, and the anime definitely portrays the profession as being beneficial to character development for both the girls and their clients. Now I’m sure people dislike such an industry, but I personally like to keep fiction and reality separate. I mean there’s tons of anime and other media that deal with far worse topics that have plagued society such as pedophilia and slavery. Yes, I’m vehemently against all of these practices, but to me, it’s just a show trying to be different, so I don’t care if the subject material might be a little controversial. I can understand being against it since it seems to glorify an unethical practice, but as long as it plays its role in the show well and contributes something of value to the narrative, I’m generally fine with whatever content is being displayed. And hey, if you just can’t make the separation, then that’s obviously fine too. \\n\\nAside from the whole buying a shallow substitute for an actual romantic partner ordeal, the most polarizing aspect of this show seems to be the protagonist himself. I’ve seen Kazuya get a lot of hate for being a mostly wimpy guy who sexually fantasizes about the cute girls in his life constantly. And you wanna know the worst part? Get ready…Kazuya faps! *totally shook* Wow, no wonder people hate him!\\n\\nYeah, people probably would deny this, but it just feels like Kazuya is hated for essentially acting like a typical horny dude would. He’s no OP anime hero and, while admittedly overblown in his cringyness (I mean he stalks Chizuru for an entire day at one point), generally acts like a regular guy. But wait, he occasionally has moments of heroism and selflessness befitting an anime protagonist that make girls fall for him, so I guess he’s not completely irredeemable! While far from great, I think he’s a fitting protagonist for this type of show and is an overall positive for the anime. \\n\\nI mean, the show itself even knows that he’s trash and constantly pokes fun at him by writing things like “He is the problem.” Kazuya being this way is intentional and the anime utilizes his cringyness well. \\n\\nGetting to the technical aspects of the show, the art is the highlight of the anime. Character designs are on point and the girls are equipped with cutely designed outfits. The cast is extremely expressive and the facial aesthetics really contribute to selling the comedy, romance, and awkwardness of numerous scenes. Even though they’re done by different studios, the art really reminds me of Nisekoi in terms of how characters are drawn when they go all blushy blush, and it’s great. Background visuals are pretty basic and I feel like fluidity could be better in that some scenes just look stiff, but overall the show is pretty good animation wise. \\n\\nLet’s just take a moment to appreciate the great vocal cast. The studio really went out of their way to hire a collection of well known and established seiyuu to voice the four main girls. They all did a wonderful job and really enhanced their respective characters with their vocal performances. The music is fine, though did anyone else notice that one of the OSTs sounds like a remix of Chopin’s Funeral March at the beginning? Just me? Well, I thought it added an extra layer of irony by basically implying that Kazuya was digging his own grave in a lot of these instances due to the cringy situations he constantly found himself in. I also ended up really liking the episode 7 ending theme not just for the catchy tune but also for the clever visual portrayal of Ruka’s backstory. I thought this was an imaginative way to explain her past without it taking up too much space in the actual show. It was quite captivating and effective in my eyes, and was definitely a highlight of the anime for me. \\n\\nWhat can I say, I thought Rent-A-Girlfriend was a fun anime. I got decently invested in the show and was smiling throughout most of my time watching. The solid production values combined with the entertaining cast really elevated the show for me. It’s nothing particularly great, but it’s definitely a fun RomCom that I would recommend watching…if you can handle boatloads of cringe that is!',\n",

       "  'I\\'m just reading the other reviews about Orange, and around 70% are giving it a 5 or lower. Now I\\'m sitting here wondering what could possibly be going on in those people\\'s lives that makes them rate such a good show such a low score? Let\\'s start with the plot. I really liked the story (9/10) because of two things. One, time travel is a theme that is hard to nail. There are films that do horribly because they do nothing to explain it. There are films that receive mixed reviews because they over-explain it (Interstellar). And then there are films that don\\'t overload you withthe science while including a basic explanation to allow the story to flow. Do I 100% understand how the letters were sent back? Of course not, because no one does. However, I think Orange explained their version of time travel well enough to not have viewers nitpick at it. They elaborated enough so that it doesn\\'t have to be the main emphasis of the anime. Actually this transitions really well into my second point. The main emphasis of Orange is actually not on the concept of time travel (*what really? I didn\\'t know that...*) but rather on the selflessness of friends and what friends will do to continue being friends. MC Naho receives a letter from the future and tries to save her friend and crush\\'s life. How selfless can you get? I understand that some of her actions were pretty stupid, but then again, this is a school slice of life anime. Everybody makes mistakes, everybody has those days. But how Orange wove in the events in the letters and how they changed in the present was so masterfully done that I had to rate the story a 9.\\n\\nThe art of Orange was pretty good (8/10). Made from the same studio as Ao Haru Ride, it\\'s not exactly the type of conventional art style we think of when we hear the word \"anime\", but I think it would\\'ve been a hindrance if it were to be animated in how most of us are used to seeing anime. Orange is a softer anime and the art definitely contributed to that effect.\\n\\nThe soundtrack, by itself, is very good (8/10). I\\'m now listening to Kobukuro thanks to Orange\\'s ending. Mirai (the ending song) has a really soft timbre and provides the feels train with electricity. Whenever I hear those first ascending notes in the ending, I get goosebumps. Hikari no Hahen, the opening song, is pretty much the average for any serious high school show. Guitars, lighthearted vocals, and standard drumming, it just screams \"mainstream slice of life right here!\" Apart from the opening and ending, the sounds in the actual anime aren\\'t bad - they contribute to the scene sometimes, but other times they are just annoying.\\n\\nThe character development is where Orange really takes the W (10/10). First of all, Naho is a social dandere and makes for an annoying MC sometimes, due to her inability to make the right decisions, but it\\'s cute when she gets it right. I mean, you have a letter from the future to tell you what to do right, but she ignores some of it, or even follows it to the letter (heh) and that just ticks me off sometimes. Kakeru is a solid character - he blames himself for his mother\\'s death and near the end, shuts himself out from his friends thinking that he\\'s hurting them. How sweet can you get... I mean, he\\'s the one hurting the most, but he doesn\\'t want to burden others, what a sympathetic character. I can\\'t really say I feel for him since my parents are alive and well, but it\\'s understandable why he acts the way he does. Suwa is a really strong character, both in the physical sense and the emotional sense. He is supportive, and is ready to take on any challenge. He doesn\\'t really change throughout the show, but he\\'s reliable and probably the smartest out of the whole bunch, which is funny considering he\\'s also the jock in the group. He sacrifices his own love life for Naho and Kakeru\\'s. That\\'s called selflessness and taking one for the team. Takako is just Takako, not really an interesting character, she\\'s just there. Now we get interesting. Azusa is the outgoing girl of the group, and she\\'s the one who usually plays matchmaker. Everyone likes her, and if she wasn\\'t in the show, Orange would get bland very quickly. My favourite character, Hagita, is the nerdy and seemingly pessimistic of the bunch. He\\'s quite the tsundere and is portrayed to have a crush on Azusa. Actually, he\\'s married to her in the future. He acts as the comedic relief, often ignored and made fun of, but he has as much of an importance on the story as everyone else. After all, he\\'s the one who broke Kakeru\\'s bike to protect him. He\\'s the best.\\n\\nThe enjoyment factor of Orange was off the charts (10/10). Often, I would go through the weekdays wishing for Sunday to come to watch Orange on Kissanime. If it detracts my attention from my work and captivates me when I\\'m watching, I can\\'t see how it deserves anything less than a 10 for enjoyment.\\n\\nOverall, Orange received a 9 from me, because of its successful characters and plot. For all you reviewers who gave Orange a five or lower, I would *strongly* insist that you reconsider.',\n",
       "  \"“Mix the chlorosulfuric acid into the acetanilide we just made, and we get para-acetamidobenzenesulfonyl chloride.” Dr. Stone is a very, very good children’s cartoon. Easily one of the best series to ever come out of the Weekly Shonen Jump. Normally, I wouldn’t care about a children’s cartoon enough to review it, cause I’m an adult (it’s a joke, it’s hard to convey the comedic intent in writing because you can’t do intonations… so you wouldn’t get it unless I explain it). But the polarized audience reaction to this show is a phenomenon interesting in itself. Dr. Stone very vividly demonstrates that any show has two completely distinctcomponents to it - the plot and the story. The plot is a summary of the events that happen during the show - who goes where, does what, fights whom, etc. The story is the show’s ideas, themes and messages, i.e. the point it is trying to present to us, the audience. And this is where the root of the polarized response to Dr. Stone lies. People who like it, like the story. People who hate it, hate the plot. You could say that they watched two different shows. I wouldn’t say that, though - I would say the first group watched an anime called Dr. Stone, and the second group didn’t watch anything because they failed the act of watching a TV show on a fundamental level. Because the plot is completely irrelevant, only “the point” of the show is what matters - it’s literally in the freaking name of the thing. Prioritizing the summary of events over it would also very literally be “missing the point.” Have I made my point clear? Good, I will now proceed to describe both the plot and the story of this series to elaborate.\\n\\nThe plot of Dr. Stone is a Sunday morning pop-science show framed as your typical WSJ battle shounen. It’s a steady stream of flashy physics/chemistry experiments meant to get children interested in science by making it look cool. It’s also a steady stream of training, battles and tournaments as you would expect of the battle shounen - but here they’re meant to show off to children the scientific method and scientific way of thinking - which is done by contextualizing those things as the means to achieving the fundamental WSJ values of Friendship, Effort, Victory (i.e. knowing how stuff works lets you save people, planning and preparation gives you the upper hand in battle, etc).\\nThe target audience defines the show’s simplicity of presentation - clear-cut good guys vs. bad guys, absurdly over the top developments, physical comedy, etc. - and these are the parts that get targeted as “contrived” or “unrealistic” by the segment of the audience incapable of engaging a work of fiction on any level except the most literal. If you consider the “world's strongest teenager” punching a lion to death unrealistic - that’s a wrong show for you. Also, anime is a wrong medium for you, because the whole point of animation is the absence of constraints reality imposes on live-action, and any anime that has the level of realism of a TV show is by definition a bad anime, but that’s just fyi.\\nIncidentally, what I called “simplicity” is only simple by the standards of high-brow literature - the show’s writing is miles better than your average shounen. It stays clear from most of the insufferable birth defects of the genre - for example, it doesn’t subject the audience to any of the “narrating things literally happening on-screen right now because children can’t be trusted to process visual information.'' \\n\\nAnd here’s what makes up the story - the part responsible for Dr. Stone being one of the best series to come out of WSJ like I said above:\\n1) The best representation of science in a TV series, period. Characters have to slowly and painfully grind to get results, to obtain any sort of a complex thing multiple people with different skills and competences are needed, trial and error rules the day, etc. While artistic license is employed, it’s very minimal - if some process takes half a year in real life it WILL take half a year in-universe.\\n2) Reconstruction (as in, modification that makes it more in line with reality) of the standard shounen tropes. The protagonist is a genius kid - but his genius is a bunch of encyclopaedic knowledge. He read a lot of books, i.e. put in hard work and dedication, and got rewarded for it. No inherited genetic superpowers, no power-ups acquired by being hot-blooded - just a good old effort. When he encounters something outside of his area of expertise, he fumbles and struggles like any of us would. An actually relatable role model.\\n3) Campiness and unpredictability. Larger-than-life characters and over-the-top developments that keep you awake because you haven’t seen them in 500 other shows before.\\n4) Theme and narrative consistency. One of the main messages of the show is that science can explain any mystery with enough time and effort - there is no such thing as supernatural. The story introduces quite a few things that appear ridiculous or nonsensical (hence campiness) - and lo and behold - they do get the in-universe explanations eventually, even if it takes a lot of time.\\n5) It does, in fact, make science look cool. One of the best scenes of the series is a presentation on how much of a difference for one’s quality of life a simple pair of glasses makes. Teaching/reminding the audience just how amazing are the fruits of civilization that we take for granted is the most inspiring thing ever.\\n\\nSome other unrelated notes:\\n- The artist is Korean so the art is manhwa-like, unusual by the normal anime standards. Female character faces are definitely not for the faint of heart.\\n- The series effectively reboots itself after ~6 episodes, to a point where I question why those early installment weirdness parts weren’t given the FMA: Brotherhood treatment. You can’t exactly skip them, cause they’re full of plot points, just a heads up that you’ll be watching a very different show after a certain point.\\n \\n9/10 for “having your children watch this would be good parenting”.\",\n",
       "  \"Steins;Gate. One of the most popular visual novels of 2009. When I first heard it would get an anime adaptation, I was both psyched and worried. We all know VN to anime adaptations don’t work out that well most (read: almost ALL) of the time, and we all know that ChäoS;HEAd’s anime was absolutely terrible, especially if you compare it to the obviously superior source material, but even because of all this I was incredibly hyped for it. I had only heard great things about the VN, and I was getting my hopes up really high. I didn’t want to get them too that highthough, because I was bound to get disappointed, right? Right?!\\n\\nWell, guess what. I didn’t.\\n\\nSteins;Gate is an absolute masterpiece. The first episode is incredibly confusing, and the rest is some light-hearted story about a group of friends developing a microwave that is able to send text messages to the past. The story does get more dark and thrilling along the way, and when you're half way into the show, shit gets real. As in seriously, it gets effing real. \\nSteins;Gate then turns into a science-fiction thriller with twists and turns that almost every viewer did not see coming. It will keep you on the edge of your seat and almost every episode ends with a certain cliffhanger, which made watching this show while it aired extremely painful, but also an amazing experience. The story is very good, and the plot development has great pacing; it is neither rushed, nor slow. \\n\\nThe show’s characters are great. They’re all loveable, and almost all the supporting characters get 1 or 2 episodes dedicated to them, which develop them more than most of the supporting characters of other shows. And what’s even funnier, almost all of the female characters are kind of stereotypical. We have the tsundere, the cutesy maid, the childhood friend, the silent and shy one and we even have a trap! And I can tell you, that all of these characters are absolutely great. We all hate the stereotypes that IS: Infinite Stratos and almost all of JC Staff’s latest crappy anime give us, but guess what. These girls are amazing.  I started watching the series with not really liking everyone, but I ended this series with loving almost every character. They’re beautifully written, have great personalities, and they all end up way less stereotypical than you’d think they were at first. There just isn’t a single thing that you can hate about them. It’s like the complete opposite of School Days’ characters. \\n\\nBut the absolute star has to be our “MAD SCIENTIST” Okabe Rintarou. His personality is great, and he isn’t like every single other anime’s male main character: he isn’t dense, he isn’t afraid of girls and he doesn’t take shit from anyone. I mean, hell, how long has it been since we’ve had a guy like this? \\nAlong with Steins;Gate’s awesome characters, we have beautiful performances of very talented seiyuu. We all know Miyano Mamoru is a great seiyuu, but his performance for Okabe has to be one of his most amazing ones to date. Miyano and his superb voice for Okabe will leave you laughing for several minutes multiple times. Imai Isami plays the tsundere for Steins;Gate, and she’s fairly good at it. She has a nice voice, even when she’s mad, but it’s better when she’s being kind. Hanazawa Kana does a great job at portraying the seemingly brainless Shiina Mayuri, but I have to admit, I’m kind of getting sick of this voice of her. I prefer she’d do some different roles now and then, like she did in Kannagi.\\nKobayashi Yuu gives an outstanding performance as the show’s trap, but we’re used to that. Her ambiguous voice does its job once again. And Tamura Yukari definitely deserves an honorable mention, since she has delivered an absolutely amazing performance as Amane Suzuha. During one of the episodes, she expressed so much emotion, that I got all teary-eyed. I mean, I shed some manly tears. \\n\\nSteins;Gate’s soundtrack is nice, it fits the situations perfectly. It excels at giving amazing background music at the show’s most suspenseful scenes, and I’m sure it’d be a lot less enjoyable without it. \\nThe bad thing about Steins;Gate is its sound effects. They sound INCREDIBLY dated, it’s like White Fox cut them straight out of a 90’s anime and just pasted them at the last moment using Windows Movie Maker. The most simple sound effects were horrible, like hitting someone or smashing a door. This annoyed me at times, but it didn’t take away any of the enjoyment this show has given me. \\nAnd now, the show’s opening. I’m an avid Itou Kanako fan, so you probably could’ve imagined that I went rabid when I heard the show’s opening theme song. It’s amazing. I can’t stop listening to it. And the opening animation fits the song perfectly. Props to the person that directed the opening, it’s a great start to an amazing episode of a superb anime.\\nThe ending theme song, sung by Sakakibara Yui, who also voiced FES in ChäoS;HEAd which is also a singer in that anime/VN, fits the anime perfectly, whether it ended happily, with a cliffhanger or with something incredibly sad. \\n\\nThe animation was, sadly, disappointing. Especially after 5pb’s producer told us through twitter that Steins;Gate would feature movie-like animation. Some of the scenes are beautifully animated, but when a scene has zoomed out characters, they’re drawn very ugly and you just can’t refrain from pointing out the errors and laughing at them. It also features awkward zooms on the characters’ faces at times, which do work out most of the time, but sometimes it just looks plain bad. The anime also has dark and grey backgrounds, which feature no life at all and are mostly boring to look at. But well, that was expectable, since most of the anime takes place in a small room.\\nI know that I’m only naming the bad things right now, but Steins;Gate’s animation is pretty good. Let’s just say it works most of the time, and some of the scenes feature a peculiar style of art, animation and camera angles which look great.\\n\\nSteins;Gate’s original character designs were handled by Huke, and he did a great job with it. It’s a pity that the anime production staff decided to not keep the VN’s original art choice, but it’s would’ve been difficult to adapt that in a moving animation, so I do understand their choice. I do wish that they had kept the VN’s eye designs, since they were beautiful. And I thought they kept it too, after looking at several promotional images of the anime and seeing that they featured the VN’s awesome eye designs. Sadly, they weren’t there in the anime adaptation. But now I’m just nitpicking again.\\n\\nSUMMARY:\\n\\nSteins;Gate is a suspenseful ride that you will not forget any time soon after you’ve finished watching it. It is so incredibly thrilling and it has so many plot twists and mind blowing events, that you’ll hold your breath or scream at the screen multiple times. It features amazing voice acting performances by talented seiyuu and a great soundtrack, including the opening and the ending. You will end up loving all of this show’s characters, since they all of their own charm and they’re all incredibly likeable. \\nThe animation is fairly good, and the sound effects are incredibly dated, but don’t let that scare you off. Steins;Gate is a masterpiece. It will twist your emotions in multiple ways loads of times. It’s an absolute must-watch, and it’s definitely one of THE best thrillers in the history of anime. \\n\\nSTORY = 10\\nART/ANIMATION = 7\\nMUSIC/VOICE ACTING/SFX = 9\\nCHARACTERS = 10\\nENJOYMENT = 10\\nOVERALL SCORE = (STORYx2 + ART + SOUND + CHARx2 + ENJOYx3)/9 = 9,55556 = 10\\n\\nFinal score for Steins;Gate = 10/10 (ABSOLUTE MASTERPIECE)\",\n",
       "  'Normally I wouldn\\'t write a review about something as such, however never have I been moved by a anime cartoon such as Ergo Proxy. So with that said, here is my first ever review of something. Story (10) - The storyline is captivating from the very start of this anime, it does really draw you in and make you wonder how and why everything is the way it is. That alone is a very broad description, I wish not to spoil it for any or hopeful watchers. Art (10) - The artwork regarding all of the different techniques used for this is a feat IMO,an absolute work of brillance to get all these different styles to fit into one anime, resulting in the beautiful breathtaking alustriousness that is Ergo Proxy.\\n\\nCharacter (10) - Impressive.  And that\\'s being modest.  Not spoiling anything, each character serves a purpose and it\\'s made clear before the ending to clear up any confusion the watcher may have during the episodes.  The dynamic ways the main characters play off each other are simply perfect, like a match made by fate.\\n\\nEnjoyment (10) - Not having watched much anime cartoons as of yet, besides that of the faire on Adult Swim, I would have to say this is the best of the best to what I\\'ve experienced so far.\\n\\nOverall (10) - If you are into the darker more serious types of anime cartoons, even when the child-ish type of character isn\\'t annoying this is for you.   Perfection in all aspects.  Yes even, Q-Q-Q.... be it odd, was still something that made the series all the more richer.  This series left me wondering if anything as good, \"see above ratings\" was available, and I am sure there is.  It also left me wanting more of Re-L, Vincent Law &amp; Pino.',\n",
       "  'Parasyte (Kiseijuu: Sei no Kakuritsu) is a throwback to the old nineties sci-fi alien killing machine anime with a very thought provoking message. Story: Unpredictable - Parasyte goes from light-hearted school life moments to some of the most gruesome murders in the same episode. Parasyte does well to let you know early on that everyone is in mortal danger and nothing is sacred. There are moments where I was nearly unable to continue watching the show, which made it all the more impactful. Art: Parasyte\\'s animation is above average but nothing too special in this day and age. The important scenes and characters are well drawn, howeverin some scenes they used that god awful 3D-rendering for panning crowd shots, which I absolutely hate, but can deal with in minor doses. The fighting scenes looked physical when they needed to, and they really nailed how arbitrarily the parasites can kill a person. I\\'m glad that they didn\\'t shy away from blood and gore, but also didn\\'t use an excessive - and unrealistic - amount of it.\\n\\nSound:\\nSolid type-cast voice acting with no annoying characters you wish would die just so they\\'d never speak again. The intro song is OK, a tad too \"angsty-teen-who\\'s-favorite-band-is-Linkin-Park\" for me, but it fits the anime well. The outro song is really inappropriate and unsuitable except for a few select episodes, hilariously so.\\n\\nCharacter:\\nA fairly bland main character in Izumi Shinichi somehow becomes more interesting by becoming more bland. The real star of the show is without a doubt Migi, with his dry humor and subtle quips that compliment his generally creepy (but somehow also cute?) appearance. The supporting cast definitely have more depth to them than Izumi, but he manages to engage the viewer by himself enough to be passable.\\n\\nThe strength of Parasyte is that you are never fully able to tell who is the antagonist, if there is one at all. It\\'s about survival, and at the end of the day can you blame anyone for desiring to live?\\n\\nEnjoyment:\\nThis anime ripped my emotions to shreds; you\\'re never quite settled in and it just keeps landing haymakers right where it hurts. It deeply invests you in its story - toys with you - before leaving you high and dry, and yet I couldn\\'t get enough!\\n\\nOverall:\\n9/10 due to a fantastic and thoughtful story; the only thing I felt held it back from the mythical 10/10 was a forgettable main character and several inconsistencies regarding characters (mostly with the ever-frustrating Murano Satomi). I left Parasyte feeling satisfied and yet also hungering for more.',\n",
       "  '[5.0/10] _____________________________________________________________________________________________________ Filters, dolls, and grooming children Woody Allen style, the somewhat contentious Violet Evergarden attempts to do so much. From the precise, focused presentation by Kyoto Animation\\'s art team to the messy, bloated, and ugly narrative, there is a lot to consume within the series. A lot to consume, but not a lot to digest. Like an airy, mediocre castella cake, it slips into your mouth with an initial hint of sweetness but once you really begin chewing it is just a piece of soft, bland bread. With KyoAni\\'s dark horse in the director\\'s chair struggling desperately to milk every ounce of emotion from this series,we get a holistically fake experience. One, like the dolls presented, lacking all forms of nuance, subtlety, and pacing. It is too slow when getting through exposition, too fast when the trajectory is on the action, and ultimately a confusing, directionless mess of scattering debris and disappointing characterization with equally banal storytelling. \\n\\nIt looks pretty incredible though.\\n\\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n[Beauty Hides the Beast]\\n\\nYeah, so Evergarden is unarguably a looker. It delivers in virtually every aspect of animation.  Kyoto Animation has, in my opinion, the most talented and proficient group of animators in the entire anime industry and then some. With a relatively small team, they release products that put every other televised anime to utter and hilarious shame. They even put some films to shame with this series. It really is that good looking.\\n\\nEvergarden\\'s aesthetic exists in the minutia, too. Not just how time-saving techniques pioneered decades ago are virtually not present within this series, which might be one of the most captivating things about the show, but it is in the lighting. How meticulous the effects work is. How they managed to convey manga-level detail into fully animated characters is literally unlike anything else I\\'ve seen in the television anime hemisphere. \\n\\nThe soundtrack is solid, even if it is overbearing. We get backing tracks over almost every scene. Thankfully, a few of them are earworms and others are simply serviceable. The opening and closing tracks are pretty forgettable and I honestly ended up skipping past them when I could. \\n\\nEverything isn\\'t perfect in the land of lens flares and filters, unfortunately. The direction is weak. I say weak in comparison to just about any other KyoAni product I\\'ve seen. Ishidate either struggled with restrictions or simply couldn\\'t develop a coherent and unique style for himself, which is rare for the beautiful palate of directors KyoAni has the privilege of working with. The few episodes helmed by other names were substantially easier on the eyes.\\n\\nThat\\'s not to say the direction is awful in the grand scheme of things. It is serviceable and this series is generally directed like a mediocre drama anime. We get all the famous, cliche, and boring shots that you\\'d expect from any other drama of Evergarden\\'s ilk. I was thoroughly underwhelmed. The beauty here really masks the beast underneath, though. While the art is unquestionably jaw-dropping and audacious. There is a lot under the hood of this series that is decidedly not so. This leads me to the beast. \\n\\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n[The Beast]\\n\\nViolet Evergarden is a super-soldier from an unknown location that is never explained or mentioned in any detail. The world here is a steampunky post-victorian England. She was trained to be nothing but a weapon. Violet is treated poorly by all the generic military men you can imagine until she is gifted, as a tool, to a random generic military guy that isn\\'t a douchebag for some reason. This guy is Gilbert, a handsome blue-haired anime boy that is probably around twice Violet\\'s age. He buys her a knick-knack and because this twelve-year-old girl has been treated like the gum on the bottom of a shoe by everyone but this one Gilbert fellow she instantly grows attached to him.\\n\\nHe proceeds to follow orders rigidly, throwing this twelve-year-old girl into battles where she promptly slaughters everyone. How does this twelve-year-old girl do this? Never explained. Regardless, she\\'s overpowered as hell and probably has ninja-genes because she naruto-runs all over these redshirts. One thing leads to another and in a war-ending battle Gilbert is injured and she tries to save him. In the process, she loses both arms and he kind of maybe sort of dies. \\n\\nNow, post-war, she begins work as an \"auto-memory doll\", which is pretty much a ghostwriter for letters. She vows to find the \"meaning of love\", which is as corny as it sounds. Violet meets a few colorful characters, and by colorful I mean lacking personality but are literally colorful. After that, we are treated to a few vignettes that are presented throughout the series. \\n\\nHere\\'s how they go : \\n\\n--&gt; Problem/Task is introduced.\\n\\n--&gt; Violet needs to travel and write.\\n\\n--&gt; Violet takes off her gloves and everyone goes \"OwO what\\'s this?\" \\n\\n--&gt; She writes something about this problem, which is somewhat related to her experiences in the past through virtue of thematic resemblances. \\n\\n--&gt; Problem resolves in a way which is either bittersweet or mostly bitter.\\n\\n--&gt; Someone monologues about something vaguely related to the story. \\n\\nIronically, these vignettes, barring episode five, are the best narratives of the series. There are two specific highlights. One is a sweet, albeit corny story of a struggling drunk playwright and how Violet reminds him of a lost loved one. The other is a short about an ill mother. Both of these hold a decent, saccharine emotional punch that genuinely is good enough for this series. Unfortunately, Evergarden quickly relapses back into the \"main narrative\" which actually unbearable. \\n\\nBefore I touch on that, I want to mention that episode five is honestly disturbing. In this vignette, Violet attempts to assist a bratty crybaby princess in writing letters to a prince she\\'s \"in love\" with. This marriage they must engage with is political, clearly, but of course, she is head-over-heels for this guy. She\\'s fourteen. He\\'s twenty-four. The parallels here are beyond clear and they are quite creepy. More so because unlike a lot of anime which does include this kind of cringe-inducing nonsense and more, this series plays itself disarmingly straight with this. You are supposed to believe and connect with the idea of a fourteen-year-old girl being married to a twenty-four-year-old man. But to make matters worse, this princess recalls the first time she met him (and the only time), which prompted her to fall in love with him.\\n\\nShe was ten. He was twenty. We get treated with an absolutely delicious bone-chilling flashback to when she was alone, crying, and this twenty-year-old man comforts this girl. It wouldn\\'t be creepy if they weren\\'t getting married four years later. The excuse I see here is that this was \"Victorian England so it\\'s fine! It\\'s acceptable to promote child abuse!\" Yeah...no? That isn\\'t the case.\\n\\nWe aren\\'t making movies about slavery and painting that in a positive light just because \"oh it\\'s a period piece!\" No. It was morally wrong then, it is morally wrong now. I don\\'t enjoy how this series is promoting these issues as if it is some grand romantic statement. Violet goes so far as to say \"Love knows no age.\" Violet. Stop this. Stop it. If the argument here is, \"she\\'s a dumb robot-Esq girl.\" Yeah, she is. But the whole point of writing something this abhorrent is to eventually correct her, not play every following scene as straight and supposedly romantic. Bad choices here. Bad. \\n\\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n[The Beast... on Further Review]\\n\\nThis leads us to the main narrative. We never get Violet\\'s origins. The show bothers to explain them in maybe one or two vague lines that don\\'t actually explain why a twelve-year-old on the battlefield is somehow socially acceptable to this decently structured and seemingly morally just society. I mean, I get a general being a cartoonishly inhuman asshole. What I don\\'t get is soldiers not questioning this in any situation. It is downright silly and, due to this, no verisimilitude is created.\\n\\nIt is as if every piece of detail was forcibly thrust into the animation and presentation, but not the actual writing. Even the minutia begins to slowly fall apart under any critical lens. There is this strange facial-gag that Violet does a few times where she squeezes and pulls at her cheeks and forces this wonky looking smile. It is admittedly cute. It, unfortunately, makes no sense.\\n\\nShe smiles. She smiles a lot in this series at crucial points. She isn\\'t incapable of smiling. Why does she do this? This strange gag was included multiple times and there is no reason for it. It doesn\\'t make sense and this already messy character becomes even messier. A gag isn\\'t worth that pain. Pulling back, though, we get this limp story about almost nothing. Finding the \"meaning of love\" seems to be vague enough if it were given nuance to sprout. Unfortunately, it has been a dry season for nuance for Kyoto Animation\\'s writers it seems. There is not a shred of it to be found. I get that character nuance is kind of a rarity within this medium, but this series gets really abrasive about not having it.\\n\\nI\\'m talking flashbacks to remind you of shit you should not be forgetting. Constantly. Constant barrages of flashbacks that utterly decimate the pacing. Everything is completely over-explained, especially the emotions. There are scenes where poor ol\\' Violet is bawling her eyes out but has the decency of explaining exactly what emotions she\\'s feeling to us. No one else, just us, the viewer, gets a front-row seat for clunky expository dialogue anyone with half a brain can deduce. \\n\\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n[Much Ado About Comparisons]\\n\\nThis season we had two series about girls who have to deal with the loss of a loved one. One being Violet Evergarden and the other being A Place Further Than the Universe. If you asked me, based solely on description and preview, which one of those would thoroughly trounce the other in almost every way? I\\'d have to go with Evergarden. \\n\\nI couldn\\'t have been more wrong. \\n\\nWhen this series decides it is a quasi-romance it is a very bad quasi-romance. I\\'ve seen some arguments regarding how Violet is supposed to be a \"daughter figure\" to this Gilbert guy, but unfortunately, when the first thing you parallel this relationship to is an underage and really creepy romance, I can\\'t really drop the fact that it feels like a creepy romance. Even if it is thankfully never established explicitly as such. However, there are, as much as it pains me to write, even more flaws here. Firstly, I can\\'t be brought to give a single shred of a fuck about Violet or this Gilbert Grape fellow. His personality is... \"Nice Guy\". While that might resonate with someone who also considers themselves to be a \"Nice Guy\" who wants nothing more than a semi-sentient doll-like girl to issue commands towards. For anyone else, I\\'m struggling to imagine a scenario where you\\'d connect with these two characters.\\n\\nThey have no chemistry. \\n\\nViolet and Gilbert are at odds as a couple or even as a father/daughter archetype. A father would do all he can not to send his percieved daughter into the midst of multiple battles whilst yelling such lines as \"Follow as she leads!\" Yes. Let us follow this emotionally stunted twelve-year-old during our siege on a castle. Great idea. If the argument here is that he was \"under orders\", then he isn\\'t much of a caring father, is he? That he\\'d be willing to potentially lose this daughter figure if it meant getting a discharge from the military. Nothing about this felt realistic. I didn\\'t buy these two characters being together and Violet\\'s attachment to him was akin to a lost puppy rather than a loved one.\\n\\nThe second option here is that she is a marketing choice. Otaku seem to love this kind of character archetype, much to my surprise, and perhaps that is why she was created like this. I, personally, can\\'t imagine someone who would want to marry or get to know this kind of person. Can you imagine how boring she must be on a date? What would you even talk about when she can hardly even speak? Regardless of my pondering on the logistics of waifuism in anime, the ultimate truth here is that her development, whilst unarguably there, is messy as hell. Most of her revelations are kept offscreen and reserved to the multiple time-skips in the narrative from episode-to-episode. She jumps from incompetent writer incapable of even understanding the basic nuance of human emotion to easily writing letters between royalty. It is preposterously paced. \\n\\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n[Conclusion]\\n\\nEvergarden really struggles. Both as a character and a series. There are moments of real highs, especially in two one-off stories that have a nice emotional punch to them. However, every single aspect of the narrative is either wholly underwhelming or utterly ludicrous. There isn\\'t a shred of verisimilitude to be developed and this series often reaches too far for cloying emotional drama. \\n\\nIf you find yourself connecting with a lot of dramatic anime that usually have bombastic orchestral or J-pop insert-songs suffocating every ounce of dialogue that usually just amounts to girls crying a lot, then you might enjoy this if you look past some of the horrendous pacing. Otherwise, I\\'d, unfortunately, advise you give this show a skip.If you find yourself interested in the aesthetic, maybe sitting through the first episode is worth it. If you value aesthetic as much as I do it might be worth the entire series in and of itself. It truly is unlike anything else. It is like a tech-demo of the Kyoto Animation Engine at Ultra-settings running on a super-computer. This is how television anime can look. Mindblowing. Even with sub-optimal directing. \\n\\nThere are themes here. The seasons play a role and plenty of the characters have names that represent different kinds of flowers. It\\'s sweet, really. I think in concept, with a sturdy hand and a sturdier pen it could\\'ve worked. These themes don\\'t serve a purpose, though. They shouldn\\'t even be brought up because apart from being frosting on a cake you can point your finger and ogle at, they are ultimately nothing. Scratch the dressing metaphor, they\\'re like those plastic toys atop an expensive cake you\\'d think were edible but are proven to be nothing but hazards to your three-year-old. \\n\\nI think the aesthetic does wonders to carry just how upsetting and mundane the rest of the series is. So much so that I\\'d average it to being a wholly mediocre experience and not an outright bad one. Even if there is a depressingly large amount of crap to sift through, it looks great. It\\'s like a Lamborghini transporting piles of horse manure. Keep your eyes trained on that astoundingly gorgeous ride and maybe you won\\'t smell the shit.',\n",
       "  \"This show helps reinforce a lot of bad anime stereotypes, namely one dimensional characters, blatant sexism, and catchy opening music. Music: the first opening song was a pretty catchy J rock song, and the ending song was decent too. The second OP had an interesting metal feel to it, but it was way too serious for this show. Animation: easily the best part of fire force, the animation is top notch throughout. The fights are fluid, the fire effects are dazzling at times, and there are a few shots that are just plain beautiful. Story: unfortunately, when it comes to the substance of the show,basically everything falls short. The setting is initially shown as being a grim world where people can randomly burn to death and turn into flaming monsters, and humanity lives in a single city cowering in fear. Instead of being sobering, serious, or introspective at all, the writer decided to take the potentially grim story and turn into a literal joke. The show is littered with ill times jokes and nudity is randomly used as a crutch. There is zero dramatic tension, and you never worry about the characters coming out on top. The fights, while looking good, are weirdly timed and feel more like short debates instead of super powered conflicts. The dialogue is nonsense at times, characters reaching conclusions that the writer clearly wants them to reach without logically arriving at them. \\n\\n\\nCharacters: The characters are textbook definitions of one dimensional. You can generally tell how good a show is based on how it treats it's female characters, and fire force treats its female characters, who all except for one are supposed to be battle hardened, like helpless maidens that require saving. The religious sister needs to be saved from the female captain, the female captain needs to be saved from whatever she was trying to do at the beginning, the buff girl needs to be saved from the dark, the useless girl who cant keep her clothes on needs to be saved from the guy she admires. The women in this show only exist to be saved, and its pretty trashy. The best way to tell everyone apart is by their powers, because there really isn't anything to these people. The main guy shoots fire from his feet to move around, another guy uses fire to change the trajectory of his bullets, another guy uses fire to create a plasma blade from a sword hilt, the naked girl uses fire to make herself cat ears, the buff girl uses fire to create floating balls of fire with faces, and the captain wears armor and punches things. \\n\\nRe-watch potential: Zero. It took me almost 2 months to get through the entire season because of how grueling it felt. \\n\\nOverall thoughts: One of the more disappointing shows I've ever seen, it still has potential for future seasons, but the first season is a narrative mess and the characters are as bland as they get. 4/10 almost purely for the \\nanimation.\",\n",
       "  \"Disclaimer: There are spoilers in my review; please continue with caution. Additionally, I am not a professional critic. These are some of the thoughts I had while watching the movie. Yes, this is around my 5th time watching it. I believe I was very young the first time. Anyway, enjoy my thoughts scrambled into paragraphs. A Fantastical world, picturesque settings, heart-warming and wrenching music (OST), but semi-confusing characters. If only they had more time to flesh them out. What is it with Howl, a gifted wizard, being so focused on looking attractive? I quote, (from the English dub), “I give up. I see no pointin living if I can’t be beautiful.” Bro, what? \\nApparently, he only pursues those who are pretty, by his standards. For example, he tried to “win over” this beautiful witch, but, uh-oh, it was a catfish, she was actually ugly. Now, Howl wants to run away from the mess he made. Yeah, that witch, the witch of waste, is now pursuing, or, in better terms, hunting him down. I mean, can you blame her? \\n\\nHowl has a real temper issue. Apparently, according to Markl, Howl calls the spirits of darkness. When do you think he would do such a feat? Well, whatever you thought is most likely wrong. Howl called them when his girlfriend broke up with him. Then, the audience gets to see him do it. This time, it is not because one of his toxic relationships died, but due to his hair color being “hideous”. Howl, what are you trying to say about gingers, huh? \\n\\nHonestly, It might seem like I despise Howl, but I do not. Actually, I find him to be an interesting character. I find him intriguing because he is very complex. Due to this, the movie does not have enough time to go into detail or develop him better. I would have loved it so much if they did. This man has so many traits and quirks to him. They truly did him dirty, in my opinion. \\nYou can see the direction they want to take Howl’s character. I mean, they set him up to be a womanizer, and, by the end of the film, he finds “true love” in someone that appeared to be an old lady, and who hates their appearance (overall, he learns the meaning of true love, supposedly). However, throughout the film, he sees her real appearance and most likely knows a curse is put on her. So, was there really any development in this field? \\n\\n(I Digress)\\nAt the beginning of the film, Sophie, the protagonist, is being harassed by soldiers, who are in uniform. However, out of nowhere, this guy, who is set up to be dangerous, saves her. When I say dangerous, the first lines of the movie state how Howl ripped out some girl's heart! Well, Sophie isn't that worried, I mean, she does not know for sure it is/was Howl (who saved her). Oh - wait, a few minutes later, in the movie, she realizes it WAS him. Despite this, she has no reaction, nothing like, “Wow, you were the one that saved me. I had a misconjecture about you.”. I have no clue, some reaction would have been nice. I do get the fact she might be trying to keep her original identity a secret, but she does tell him her name. Why not state how they have met before? I feel like they brush over smaller details, like this, throughout the movie. \\n\\nDespite these “criticisms”, I do really love the movie. My favorite aspects, of it, over-shadow all these little nitpicks. It does a great job of immersing the viewer, using visuals and music. Do not get me wrong, I do like some of the characters, but this is one of the weakest points (do not get me started on the plot issues). They try to fit everything in, which is their downfall. Overall, I think I should read the book, and come to a conclusion on how I feel about this story overall. This is not my favorite studio ghibli film, but, for some reason, I feel a real connection with it; nostalgia is a word that comes to mind. Hey, I mean, sometimes we can not control our feelings and what we like, right? (I am such a sucker for the instrumental music though!!)\",\n",
       "  \"6/10. It was fine, but I would never bother rewatching it. The pacing was too slow for my liking and the story was depressing but in a dragged out sort of way. Everything felt like it was at 0.5 speed. The characters are okay but I didn't particularly love any of them. It seemed a little odd that this group of friends would be SO invested in Kakeru when he's the newest member of the group. I would have preferred if he had been their friend from childhood. It also felt a little unrealistic that Suwa would be so selfless when he clearly also likesNaho. I just wish they would have developed the cast chemistry a little more before we got to the big reveal.\",\n",
       "  'When I first watched Black Butler, I was like 10/10 AMAZING OHHHH but then i went back and rewatched some episodes and I was like damn... it\\'s not as good as it seems. I mean, I loved watching Kuroshitsuji. It is definitely not the worst anime I\\'ve seen, (the worst anime I\\'ve seen is Diabolik Lovers, BARFS, i refuse to even put that on my list, that\\'s how bad it is), however there are some big flaws that need to be pointed out. Before I get to that, I\\'ll give you the main idea of the anime. STORY Our setting is Victorian Europe. So there\\'s this kid named Ciel Phantomhive,who\\'s parents die in a fire that took his whole mansion at the age of 10. A demon comes to him, Sebastian, and gives him an offer; Sebastian would help Ciel get his revenge on the many who took part in killing his parents, and when Ciel was completely satisfied with his revenge, Sebastian would eat Ciel\\'s soul. Sebastian would also protect him through thick and thin, and be his loyal Butler. Ciel is engulfed in his hatred for those who killed his precious parents, and his dog. He accepts this offer, and this anime is about Ciel, known as \"The Queen\\'s Guard Dog\" because of his devotion to her majesty. They solve a lot of mysteries throughout this first season.\\n\\nBLACK BUTLER PROS:\\n   it\\'s really easy to get attached to Ciel. I\\'ve met some that think he\\'s just a brat, but he really does go through character development. Sebastian doesn\\'t; he\\'s a demon. But he does have a personality, and it\\'s easy to see that Sebastian differs from other demons (however only in Kuroshitsuji II, which you can only watch after watching the first season, duh.) It was, at least for me, an enjoyable series. I can see NEW anime fans being obsessed with this, so if you\\'re new to anime, I recommend this series, probably in the top 3 anime i\\'d tell new people to watch.\\n To be honest... I can\\'t really think of anything else. The series has good characters, (the only GREAT character, when it comes to development, is Ciel, maybe Elizabeth who you\\'ll find out about when watching.)\\n\\nEnglish Dub\\nReally good, I do remember a major problem with it in the first episode, but that\\'s about it. It was just a minor mistake, but in the rest of the series i really enjoyed it.\\n\\nJapanese w/sub\\nI watched the series in dub...\\n\\nBLACK BUTLER CONS\\n\\nFirst of all... humor. The humor in this series, in my opinion, wasn\\'t executed well at all. There were barely any serious moments that weren\\'t interrupted by comedy. Don\\'t get me wrong, it\\'s ok to install comedy relief once in a while to make things flow, but dang... almost every damn serious scene is paused abruptly by things that sometimes aren\\'t funny at all. LET SERIOUS MOMENTS BE SERIOUS MOMENTS!\\n\\nSecond... animation. It wasn\\'t HORRIBLE, but it wasn\\'t spectacular either. It was good. I do admire the design for Ciel\\'s character, but that\\'s about it. The rest is just average. I would\\'ve enjoyed it much more if it was visually appealing. \\n\\nI mean... SO MUCH POTENTIAL wasted with this first season. They could have done so much more... more development... better animation... the chance was there. They didn\\'t take it, and what a shame.\\n\\nBye :&gt;\\n- Mirai',\n",
       "  'Neon Genesis Evangelion is perhaps the most popular anime of all time, trumping the majority of anime franchises, and is often considered to be the best anime of all time. Needless to say, it isn\\'t. Not even close. Although it certainly had the potential to be, it just didn\\'t live up to it. Which isn\\'t to say Evangelion is bad, no. Evangelion is actually very good in many, many ways. The problem is, it counteracts this by having some horrible problem in another way. The premise of Evangelion is set in 2015, set 15 years after the apocolypse, or \"2nd Impact\" wiped out half of humanity.I do love when a show claims Judgement Day will happen in the near-future, and gets ultimately proven wrong. At any rate, humanity is 15 years later being attacked by these things called \"Angels\", for some reason, and must kill them in giant robots called \"Evangelion\", to prevent 3rd Impact from happening. And so beings our vague story of vague vagueness.\\n\\nAnd what a vague story it is. Evangelion loves suspense like a fat kid loves twinkies, and will throw in 5 plot twists and/or questions per episode, without answering any of the present ones. It kicks off being something of a Monster-of-the-week thing, and does stick to the formula over the course of the next 26 episodes, but at the same time doing it, and pretty much everything else, completely different to anything and everything that has come before or since. Our normal plot is cut inbeetween with bizzare symbolism and obscure Biblical references, as well as the occassional Navel-gazing episode, which are usually a mental and visual mindfuck, and often very, very disturbing.\\n\\nHorror is a genre that isn\\'t used very much in anime, and while Evangelion is very much a Sci-Fi show, it becomes more horrific than anything i\\'ve seen in any horror movie. Nothing regularly associated with the genre comes close to being as sickening and disturbing as some of the thing you\\'ll see in Evangelion, which I will avoid stating for the sake of massive spoilers. But all of these add to what Gainax does best: Immersion. I don\\'t think i\\'d be overstating it to say that Evangelion is the most emmersive, involving anime there has ever been, and you genuinely feel an attachment to this world and its inhabitants. Except Asuka. I could rant for a loooooong time about why I hate Asuka, but let\\'s just say she\\'s an irritating bitch who has a large amount of reverse character development.\\n\\nSpeaking of the characters, the characterization falls into a weird void wherein I can\\'t honestly decide if they were lazily written or perfectly formed. While some of them become unbearably whiny, uninteresting, bitchy, or downright twisted, don\\'t real people often fall to the same pitfalls? I\\'ve known plenty of people like Asuka in my time, although none of them quite so fucked up, and I can honestly see a lot of realism in that. Although there is one character I will say was undeniably fantastic, which makes the fact that he appears for all of one episode all the more tragic - Kaworu. Whether or not he is a good character (a question very much up for debate for every single character in this show), every moment he is on screen is a joy, providing a strange kind of relief much akin to what he actually does in-story. And probably moreso to fangirls... I can imagine a million of them squeeing over that one particular scene in the shower. You know the one.\\n\\nProduction-wise, the show is a very large up-and-down case. Artistically, the style is likeable and unique, and really brings something to the show. However, the animation is full of enormous and blatant corner-cutting. I am willing to forgive this to some extent, though, in that it was used to interesting artistic merit. The soundtrack is a strong, memorable affair, with several vivid tracks that remain easy to associate with the series. The English dub is a strange mix of realism and annoyance, but it has to be credited in that you really can\\'t imagine them sounding any different, something the Rebuild movies have very much proven.\\n\\nBut here\\'s the show\\'s enourmous downfall. You remember those aformentioned plot threads? The ones they introduced in bulk per episode? None of them are resolved. None. Not even a single one. The movie \"End of Evangelion\" makes a passable attempt at fixing that, but there\\'s no fixing the unbridled fury that thing that calls itself an ending will doubtlessly induce.\\n\\nBut truly, any complaint I have is somewhat irrelevant, because you HAVE to see Evangelion. There is no other series like it, and it will always be a cult thing, but there\\'s no way to know if you\\'ll like it until you watch it, with Evangelion being one of the most polarizing shows there has ever been.\\n\\nFinal Words:\\nA must see, regardless of its many faults.\\n\\nAnimation/Graphics: 4/10\\nStory/Plot: 7/10\\nMusic/Background: 8/10\\nEnglish Dub: 5/10\\n\\nOverall: 5/10 (make it 7/10 for the first 24 episodes, but those last two bring the score down HARD.)\\n\\nFor Fans Of: RahXephon, Serial Experiments Lain.',\n",
       "  \"Why 10/10? I will do my best to use right words. It will be spoiler free and short. This will NOT BE SYNOPSIS like half of red reviews with bad scores. Will talk about those later on. To use one word to describe this movie it would be beautiful. To start off with a plot, it is not to wide or to deep to see some logical sequence, but what is behind that plot is stunning. It could be relatable in a ways, and message is on spot. It shows filthy parts of this world and humans by nature but also preview of bright side. Like emotions, connection, prettiness,kindness of a soul, nature itself and etc.\\nEmotions are all over the  place, it is not so dramatic as its predecessor for me but it still have some firm points. Furthermore it is not perfect, because i always find something that is not to my taste but in the other hand it gives so much more. \\nMain characters have development and it goes trough entire movie. Support characters have more background story comparing to the main ones but it is not a bad thing. This way you can get better picture of their emotions and you don't judge them from their past actions.\\n\\nArt, music, movie dynamic is top notch as expected. It flows so smoothly that i lost count how many times i got goosebumps while watching. And result is spectacular.\\n\\nWhat more to say? Well first of all i am sorry for grammar mistakes, my English is average so don't mind me. Second, this may be little bit subjective but for those who have written bad reviews, with scores under 5 are furthest from objective thinking and should ask themselves what did they expect out of this. I am not trying to be smart but i will say this, you cannot fully judge by compering to your expectations or other anime movies. I don't say you can't compare but don't see how can you base all review on that because it does not stand and cannot be called critical review.\\n\\nAnyways, i recommend this movie.\",\n",
       "  \"Oh.my.god. Even if it isn't acknowledged as shounen ai, I can tell for sure, it was the most enjoyable among any shounen ai anime I've ever seen. The art was great, the motion, the colors, the expressions and the emotions that the characters provoked in every scene. No exaggerations or show-offs, like in most shounen ai or yaoi anime. The plot escalated in a slow but exciting way. I liked how every skater had his own personality and style, and ooooh Victor. In my opinion, Victor was the most astonishing character among any anime of this season.Simple, yet fascinating in his own sweet and attractive way.Hope there's a second season!\",\n",
       "  'First, for the sake of those who don\\'t like reading much, I\\'ll try to summarize what I can say about the anime in general. While may sound exaggerating, I would say this anime excels in almost everything. Even though the idea on which the anime based is pretty average and feels like a replica of other series, I assure you that everything about Code Geass is actually more unique and special than you think. The simple idea of \"a boy receiving powers and executing revenge\" was taken to new heights in this epic anime. The plot of this series is most likely the most intelligent, unpredictableand fast-paced you\\'ll ever see in your life. Predicting the plot of this anime isn\\'t hard – it\\'s impossible!\\nIt moves so fast and has so many twists, that at some point you\\'ll surely give up about predicting it and will simply enjoy it. \\nThe characters in the anime, differently from most famous shonen series like Naruto, feel realistic. Most anime try to offer unique characters with many strange and interesting features. But when you look closely, you should notice that those characters feel unrealistic because they have awfully extreme characteristics, which you won\\'t find in real people. In Code Geass, the characters are much more balanced and feel much more real, while still being very unique and different from each other. Another strong point about characters is their development. You will usually see how different characters deal with though decisions, and may eventually even change the side they are fighting for.\\nThe animation of the series isn\\'t something I can say much about. Personally, I like it. With that said, it\\'s not my \"perfect\" style of art, and yet I have to admit it\\'s a unique one. Rather than simply being \"good\" or \"bad\\', I think it\\'s more about your taste. If it fits your taste – you like it, and if it doesn\\'t – you don\\'t. \\nThe voice acting is really strong, especially for the main character – Lelouch. Since the anime focuses a lot about Lelouch\\'s thoughts and decisions, the voice acting plays an important role in delivering the watcher his feelings and emotions. I think it was done beautifully in this anime. I could really feel how heavy each and every one of his decisions was, as well as how he felt before and after making the decision.\\nThe music played a very important role as well, and like the voice acting – it fulfilled well its duty. Putting aside the action and tense moments, in which the music was great, I would rather focus on the tragic and dramatic moments. In these very plot-wise important moments, the music was simply perfect. Seeing the same moments without the music will make these moments simply \"another forgetful part of the plot\". But with the music, these very moments will most likely be the ones you\\'ll remember the best after finishing watching the series.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNow, for those who wish to read a more deep analysis about the series...\\n\\n\\n\\nPlot: The basic idea, which you most likely already read about somewhere, is \"Lelouch receives special power from a mysterious girl, and decides to use it in order destroy the Britannian Empire, both for revenge for his mother\\'s death and to make a peaceful world for his sister\". You will most likely also see similar words over and over when watching the beginning of each episode. It\\'s hard to believe there are many people who read such description and say \"this anime gonna be epic!\". I doubt if there are any at all. And I can\\'t blame them, because it really sounds like a pretty average and simple idea. But the strength of Code Geass isn\\'t hidden in this basic idea, but rather in the way its plot was executed. A basic plot pattern for the idea will be something like this: \"Lelouch and his organization fight against the evil commanders of the Britannian Empire and defeat them. At some point, the evil \"final boss\" arrives and Lelouch defeats him as well. Happy ending. Credits. Bye bye\"\\nThat\\'s what I believe most people would expect from this anime, and I was no exception. At the beginning, it really feels like it\\'s going to follow this plain pattern. But very soon, after watching a few episodes, you\\'ll realize that Code Geass\\'s plot is nothing as simple as that. To start with, there is no even      \"Good vs. Evil\" in this series. You can\\'t simply classify the characters and the different organizations in the series as either \"good\" or \"evil\". If I had to pick, I would rather say that the main character himself is actually \"evil\". But the most important thing about the plot, is that there are many things which make the plot very complicated. The main character, Lelouch, has more to do than just \"fight against the empire\". He also has to make sure he hides his identity, act normally in front of his sister and friends, and most of all – to be a strong and reliable leader in order to make people believe in him and follow his orders. If you think these are trivial matters which has nothing to do with the plot – you are gravely mistaken. Each and every one of them affects the plot strongly at some point, and shows you that the plot won\\'t go the way you thought it will. \\nThe plot itself is very fast paced. You may not notice this at first, as it feels like things moving a bit slow at the beginning. But once you get to the main parts, you\\'ll be flying trough the episodes, and be warned – you may not be able to stop. For me, the plot was the biggest source of entertainment in this anime. It just keeps on going and never stops to take a break. With each passing episode, my curiosity about \"what will happen next\" only grew bigger and bigger. I\\'ll admit it – I got addicted to the plot of this series, and to the series as a whole.\\n\\n\\nCharacters: Alongside with the great plot of this series, stands the amazing cast of characters. While the anime focuses a lot on the plot and on moving the story fast, it never forgets about character development. This anime has many characters, like most anime. What makes it different, and better in my opinion, is the balance of the characters. You won\\'t see \"an idiot who shouts the whole day\" or \"a girl which hits everybody when she\\'s angry\" type of characters. Every character has its own unique features, but in the same time they are all \"humans\". Which means that no matter what personality a character has, it\\'ll never act in extreme or unrealistic way. Such balanced characters are easier to understand and to become attached to. \\nAnother strong aspect of the characters is their \"state of mind\". You often see how different characters must make hard and heavy decisions, which will affect them or their surroundings in different ways. The main focus is on the main character, Lelouch, but many other characters also make important decisions in their life, like Lelouch\\'s childhood friend – Suzaku. Every character has its own past, beliefs, wishes and values. Together, they affect the decisions of the characters, and usually even put them one against another. If you look at the battles in this anime, then you\\'ll see they are mostly based on each person\\'s beliefs. These aren\\'t battles between \"good\" and \"evil\", but rather between what each character \"believes is right\". This adds a lot to the series, and doesn\\'t allow you easily judge a character as \"good\" or \"evil\". Some people may say Lelouch is \"good\", while some may say he\\'s \"evil\". Personally, I belong to the latter type. \\nBut just like I said – they are humans. Every human sometime loses his way and falls into confusion and despair. You can see it perfectly in this anime. Many characters tend to become confused of what is \"right\" and what is \"wrong\" at some point. One event can totally change the character\\'s personality, and to shake its beliefs and values. Some characters eventually even change the side they support and fight for. Your enemy in the beginning, may end up as your ally in the end and vice versa. If you ask what are the things that make this anime unpredictable, then this, without a doubt, is one of them.\\n\\n\\nAnimation: Since the character design is done by Clamp, it\\'s not strange to see how similar the art style between Code Geass and Clamp\\'s manga, like X. The characters usually look tall and slim. That\\'s how I always described Clamp\\'s art style, and I think this description pretty much fit Code Geass. I\\'m a big Clamp fan. Not because of the art style, but because of their great ideas. This art style is pretty much unique to Clamp and you can either like it or not, depends on your own taste. Thus, it\\'s hard for me to say that the art style is either \"good\" or bad\". Even though it\\'s not my \"perfect\" type of art style, I still liked it a lot. I think that in term of quality, this anime was done well – no matter whatever you like the art style or not.\\n\\n\\nSound: Since the characters are put trough different situation, the voice acting plays a very important role in this anime. If it\\'s done well, then the watcher can understand well how complicated or tense the situations are. If done badly, then everything about the anime will feel shallow and boring.  \\nI say it was done well. Very well.\\nNotably is Lelouch\\'s voice acting. No matter what the situation was, it was easy to understand it well thanks to the voice acting. Especially when Lelouch was lost or was making hard decisions, I could really understand how difficult and heavy these decisions were. Also, since Lelouch has more than one \"identity\", it was important that he\\'ll feel different in every environment. He really felt like a fearless leader when he was on the battle field, but also as a carefree student when he was at school.\\n\\n\\nMusic: It\\'s always important to have a great music. Thanks to music, many events become better and more memorable. While the anime had great music during action scenes, I would rather focus on the music during sad and dramatic moments. In these very important moments, the music was perfect, beautiful and irreplaceable. It made those few moments the most memorable ones about the series. Even seeing them again, with this perfect music, will make you enjoy them almost as much as the first time. Without this perfect music, the same scenes just won\\'t feel as great as they did.  \\n\\n\\nEnjoyment: No matter how many things I say I liked about this anime, what really made it my favorite one is: that I really enjoyed it; and to enjoy is the most important, right?\\nIt almost didn\\'t have any boring parts. It was always active, and was moving forward without taking a break. It was unpredictable to a degree I have never seen before in a series, and I LOVE unpredictable things. Basically, the anime was very thrilling for me. It\\'s like riding a roller coaster – once you start, you can\\'t quit until it ends; but you don\\'t regret it, because every moment was epic and thrilling.\\n\\n\\nOverall: I recommend this anime to everyone. No matter what you think about it, and no matter whatever you think you won\\'t like it – just try it. I was quite sure myself I won\\'t like it. For me it was \"Robots? Who the hell is going to like an anime with big robots?\"\\nThat was the reason it took me so much time to actually try this anime. But when I tried, I realized how stupid I was. It doesn\\'t matter whatever there are robots or cliché base idea. What really matters is how well it was done, and how much you enjoyed it.',\n",
       "  'Let me start by saying I went into this show not expecting to enjoy it. The way it presented itself came across as a more female-oriented shoujo-ai style, which is not my thing. I am now prepared to say that I was wrong. Avoiding going way too in-depth to not spoil anything, this show does a complete 180 after the first 15 minutes. Oshi No Ko is a mystery/drama/romance that heavily focuses on the struggles and realities of being an idol in Japan. It gives a very accurate and realistic portrayal of the industry\\'s mental struggles, financial walls, and dangers. This already sets it apartfrom its contemporaries, however, it does all this while having some of the most stellar writing in any show I have watched period. The way this show curates every character\\'s individual storylines and struggles is done in such a thoughtful and in-depth manner. This makes for a very dynamic and interesting cast, with me wanting to see more of even some of the side characters. This all works into the main plot, which is unique and has so much mystery and nuance within it that it might take a few watches to fully take in some of the hidden aspects. \\n\\nIn addition to this, the animation and art are absolutely stunning, with studio \"Doga Koba\" putting forth their highest quality effort to date(seriously, the eyes in this show are so well drawn for no reason). Of course, a show focusing on idols has to have music, and it delivers. The soundtrack is phenomenal, and I would confidently say it has one of the best intros I have ever heard. It is so damn catchy and I can\\'t get enough of it. The outro is also very fitting and works well in the flow of episodes. I must also mention the idol songs from B Komachi are great and clearly had a lot of effort put into them. \\n\\nTo conclude, I am absolutely infatuated with this show and I cannot wait for season 2 later this month. Ultimately, I cannot sing enough praise for this show, and that is why I am feeling a Perfect 10/10 (Would like to mention it is not often that I review a show, so that can make it very clear that this one stuck with me)',\n",
       "  'INTRO Jujutsu Kaisen belongs in the category that began with Demon Slayer: Anime series that are carried almost entirely by their movie-quality animation. Their plots and characters are nothing you haven’t seen before, but at least everything looks gorgeous. The Bleach fans of old in specific will rejoice, since it plays out in an almost identical way. It’s why I often jokingly call this show Bleblechu Bankaisen. By the way, Bleach will have a hard time making anyone care when its last arc gets finally adapted and it’s nowhere near the animation quality of this one. Oh, and the script is crap too. CHARACTERS The character chemistry willbe the hardest thing for most to get into, since it feels phoney. Everyone meets and befriends each other in a matter of minutes, thus there is no gravity behind their friendship. It’s one thing to spend months with someone before you can call him an ally or a friend, and a whole other to bond in mere minutes. Every Jujutsu sorcerer in the show becomes part of the team super fast, so it never feels like these characters care deeply about each other.\\n\\nCharacter motivations are another lame thing, since they are ridiculously simple. One wants to help people because his grandpa told him to do it, another wants to find her childhood friend, and a third wants to be kind like his sister. Holy smokes, it’s one thing to expect something less than trying to be the best sorcerer in the world, and a whole other to want close to nothing. There is nothing inspiring or grand in whatever they want. Naruto was instantly grabbing your attention because he was very sad on the swing, and Deku did the same by crying after being bullied and told he will never become a hero. There is no such thing here. And it doesn’t help how passive they are the whole time. They fool around waiting for orders until a mission happens and they go to the mission. Their motivations don’t matter one bit.\\n\\nThe only good thing I found in the characters is the protagonist who wants to eat a bunch of cursed fingers so he can turn into a super evil dude… and die, so that the curse of the fingers can stop hurting people. Quite noble. Also, his anguish while seeing he is unable to save every person he comes across or how he often has to kill in order to protect others is portrayed nicely.\\n\\nA special mention must be made regarding the female characters in the show, which are often praised for not existing as fan service and for being strong and independent. It’s not much of a positive trait when they come off as unlikable feminists who are too busy bitching about first world problem and their role in society, while in battle they are still far weaker than the men. Especially Nobara, who fails at almost everything she does, has to be constantly saved by the men, and yet the audience is supposed to praise her as a strong and independent woman. She’s just there to be bitching, yelling, and being obnoxious.\\n\\nACTION\\n\\nAs I said the sole reason for anyone to watch this anime is the fighting, which is super duper well animated and choreographed. Just don’t expect it to be deep or something. Most supposed tactics are silly at best and come down to a character having broken juchubruchu powers and the other one not being able to defend against them.\\n-The characters will also have to explain their juchubruchu powers in the middle of the fight. On one hand it’s lame infodumping that stops the fights. On the other it’s a lame excuse for their juchubruchu abilities to work. That’s right, if their opponent doesn’t know what hit him, he won’t get affected by them.\\n-The ending of the fights is almost always left inconclusive, because a good guy will be butting in right before a conclusive strike, the bad guy will be running away, and nothing will be resolved. It happens so many times and it never feels satisfactory. It will be leaving you with blue balls.\\n-There is never any legit reason for how they cover up the destruction caused by the monsters. There is no gas explosion excuse like in Fate Stay Porn, or an invasion from the north excuse like in God of ten chapters per episode. The barrier they set up doesn’t prevent the victims from occasionally seeing the monsters, and buildings are blowing up during the fights. So why doesn’t the public know about the curses when they are not hidden?\\n-There is also a good guy who is so powerful, no bad guy stands a chance against. The only way a good guy will bother to fight is if there is a lame excuse for why Reverse Kakashi is not present for ending everything in a few seconds. Which is why he will be often mysteriously away on a trip, or a barrier specifically designed for him will be keeping him out of the fight.\\n-There is tournament arc at some point, because there can’t be a shonen without one, and it’s easily the most boring part of the show. There are zero stakes in the fights, since nobody can die and it’s all just an excuse for showing a bunch of flashbacks regarding the support cast. Too bad none of that matter since, as I said above, these people have no chemistry and never feel like a team. They are not even important, as stated by the very bad guys who openly said that the only two people that matter are the protagonist and the blindfold guy. What a way to fodderize your entire cast just a few episodes after the show began. Even when those nobodies try to kill the protagonist you never feel any tension, because you know he can casually return to life thanks to his inner demon.\\n\\nDEATH\\n\\nThe show is full of permanent deaths, many of which are outright gruesome. They make it seem like anyone can die in horrible ways. Too bad it only happens to unimportant characters. There is also someone important who dies, but he was so stupid the whole time he almost deserved to die. That idiot thought some school bullies killed his mom, and not a mass murdering monster. Also, as I said above, the main character can resurrect whenever he feels like it, and then jokes about it when he presents himself alive and well to his friends (who have no chemistry and therefore are not much of friends). It takes away most of the tension regarding him surviving or not during the fights.\\n\\nTHE REST\\n\\nThe comedy is mostly miss for a shonen. I didn’t laugh once during the comedic moments, because they are all very weak in delivery and written for toddlers.\\n\\nWhat’s the point in having a monster hierarchy? There are difficulty levels when it comes to the monsters and yet they can already defeat the strongest grade, effectively making the chart completely obsolete in the same episode it was introduced.\\n\\nTraining is a joke. Not-Sakura (Nobara) trains to get stronger by being thrown at the ground repeatedly. Itadori masters ki control by sitting down, eating chips and watching movies. I am sure this is far more relatable to the average modern viewer than the days when shonen characters were training in lethal martial arts over a pit of lava.',\n",
       "  'Kill me if I do say that this anime was just what I had in mind of -- and so I guess I was hoping for a much better end. Why an 8? I couldn\\'t make up my mind at what kind of rating I was choosing for such an excellent played out anime. I have watched countless of science-fictional movies and TV documentaries that I think I may be a pro on just what I think is a very complicated plot, turns out to be an easy story line to catch. I think I\\'ve doubted my predictions countless of times with this anime. After hitting offwith the 1st episode of Steins;Gate, I nearly dropped the show just because it was a confusing-messed up episode. I stayed with this anime \"on-hold\" for the next few months. After months of abandonment, my friend and everybody else started to say Steins;Gate was probably the most extravagant anime out there and I couldn\\'t help myself but to think at how such an anime with such failure to start well be that great to watch. I gave a closer look at the anime\\'s summary again -- \"Time travel\". That sure brought up everything to me. That word says it out loud and my expectations were laid down at the table and I thought \\'I knew it!\\' Maybe my attachment to the movie, Inception, helped me guide the anime.\\n\\nStory: 8\\nA group of guys sending text messages to the past and researching on time travel -- sounds like a typical sci-fi to me. What\\'s amusing is how the anime plays out the scientific explanations but still contains a spec of realism in fate and destiny. Combining both of fate and science together is a very creative act that made the anime more puzzling. My use for some science predictions and some of its main components helped me most of the time to get to know the anime more. Likely an example of this is the Grandfather Paradox that I would always see in Discovery or in some sites. I\\'m a bit of a hype fan for complicated materials and my curiosity does build up as the story goes deeper. And knowing these kinds of paradox most especially in its importance in space and time helped me get to know this anime easier and without me knowing it I started to have great expectations and predictions for this anime\\'s ending. An anime that made great dramatic outcomes needs a dramatic finish.\\n\\nArt: 9\\nWhat do I say? The messy, blurry, magnifying, shaking animation (most especially in the Opening), made the art and the anime well-connected. There are lots of focused angles in the anime that just feels great for a video editor to edit. No problem with the art. It\\'s plain simple backdrop that looked like the city we live nowadays already says a message. Scientists \\'were\\' making theories and logical explanations on time travelling way beyond the 21st century started. They could have started creating a time machine already. You don\\'t know. it could happen.. Anyway, I think the animation itself screamed \\'science-fiction\\' to me.\\n\\nSound: 9\\nThe twitching sounds of the opening, the great band, the great singer\\'s voice -- it was pure heaven. The opening made it clear that this wasn\\'t just your normal anime. The ending song was more calm and I think it was great. After a 24-minute episode of pure suspense and mystery, the anime ends up with a warm music that tops off the episode like a cherry. The ending song was perfect for cliff-hangers -- that\\'s what I think.\\n\\nCharacter: 9\\nTo be able to make an anime with this logical plot, a boring character has to be out of the picture. There was never a dull moment in Steins;Gate because the characters will either give you a laugh or let you know a personality you haven\\'t discovered yet. I\\'ve known quite a well-rounded set of characters and Okabe Rintarou is one of them. Being an influential man who excels in his league of expertise and at the same time being able to instill a sense of humor, care and responsibility was one of the main reasons this anime was worth watching for.\\n\\nEnjoyment: 7\\nMy first impression of Steins;Gate during the 1st episode was very messy. And by the time the ending went by I had a \"much\" bigger expectation for such an excellent anime who has been making great cliff-hangers and scenes in every episode. I\\'m guessing an ending that would have left me hanging at the end of a sci-fi anime could have been a perfect ending for such a perfect plot. I just thought of how very \"predictable\" the ending for this anime was as it concerns more likely on time travel. A very predictable ending -- I mean we all know some Time travelling movies goes back in time because something horrible went wrong. It\\'s a very typical \"time travelling ending\" and I knew it was going to happen. I mean almost all of the Time Travelling movies/shows have the same ending or plot going on. It just didn\\'t bring anything new to the \"time travelling\" plot and especially not anything new to the science fictional types of show. More likely an ending like \"Inception\" that ends with your own intuition on what you think could have happened or a new type of information that could bring a much intelligent surprise. An ending that is more logical than the plot itself. But over-all, the anime was worth for the keeps.\\n\\nOver-all: 8\\nWatching a sci-fi anime in my part is kind of a shock since I\\'m not that easily impressed. Steins;Gate showed me a perfect example of what seem like a logical plot can exhibit dramatic scenes and many turn of events. El Psy Congroo. Yup, I definitely miss that.',\n",
       "  \"After watching a couple of Miyazakiesqe films this month, I wondered what they inherently lacked that left me feeling so disappointed. And today, after watching Porco Rosso, I can confidently answer that it was almost everything in every aspect. Miyazaki’s worlds are full of life and atmosphere, and Hisaishi's music plays an essential role in giving them an identity. They have a partnership, an unbreakable and indispensable one. The other films did not have a soul, their scores were generic, and their worlds felt shallow. Porco (or Marco) is such a memorable character. Of course, he has a striking and unique character design. He is a Pig!And not any ordinary talking pig, but the porkiest and the most badass talking pig you can find. He is also a remarkable pilot. Every character in this movie has a personality that the other films seriously lacked.\\n\\nThe comedy works, the drama is emotional, and the action is well animated—it is a complete package. Depth-wise, it is not Miyazaki’s best fantasy world, but it does successfully evokes pure wonderment and leaves a map and a mark on the audience’s minds. He also does not serve everything on a platter and leaves a lot to think about for later.\\n\\nI have nothing against Patema Inverted or Children Who Chase Lost Voices. They are fine films with solid art styles and animation. But what they lack for me is a soul and an identity, movies with clever and highly conceptual premises but poor execution. Porco Rosso, on the other hand, is perfectly executed and highly recommended for everyone.\",\n",
       "  \"Mahou Shoujo Madoka★Magica starts off as a show about a schoolgirl Kaname Madoka living a perfectly ordinary life. She has nice parents a younger brother and a few good friends. Everything is perfectly fine until one day she has a magical encounter that changes her life. That’s how the show starts, and as the show was suggested to me by a friend whose first recommendation was Another, I was surprised. The show starts off all cute and nice, which was a great surprise, and I found it really strange and quite boring, but I told myself I have to at least try to make itthrough a few episodes. The atmosphere in the show slowly began to change from this blissful school life it started getting darker and darker. It changed from a cutesy lighthearted anime into a psychological thriller.\\n\\nThe story was great, I found it original and it was never really dragging, but it never got me to feel like I had to watch another episode so it actually took me quite a while to finish it (I watched three other anime in between). The characters were all great, everyone had flashed out backstory. Everyone had believable motivation behind their actions and practically nothing went unexplained in the end. Speaking of the ending like pretty much all 12 episode anime I found it to be a bit rushed but there is are three movies made afterwards that might fix this just like the OVA saved Mirai Nikki's ending. \\n\\nThe one thing I found truly exceptional was the art, it was just beautiful especially the sequences with the witches, which looked like they had just escaped from a surrealist painting. Also the characters all looked amazing and the action sequences looked just perfectly executed. Throughout the episodes it actually managed to keep the whimsical esthetics from the start and managed to make them work in a completely different setting. There is not much to talk about the sound, nothing felt out of place and nothing that great. The opening and ending are good enough to find their way into my iTunes but I won't try to hunt down the whole soundtrack like I did with Noir and Yosuga no Sora. \\n\\nEven though I found nothing wrong with the Mahou Shoujo Madoka★Magica I just can't give it more than a low 8 because it never really pulled me in like even the adaptation disaster that is Gokukoku no Brynhildr managed to do. I can fully understand anyone who thinks this is a masterpiece and it is possible I would find it to be one also, had I watched it at a different time. No matter what I still have recommend it to everyone who wants to watch a quality anime.\",\n",
       "  'There are a few anime that I watched years ago, before I really knew what anime was. And while Pokemon and Yu-gi-oh were always entertaining, there was one anime movie that was really close to my heart: Castle in the Sky (Tenkuu no Shiro Rapyuta). I still remember going to my local library to check it out on VHS. It was my “go to” film. If I couldn’t find anything else that looked interesting, I would check out Castle in the Sky again. Each time, I would watch it over and over again before I had to take it back. Sometimes I would watch itmultiple times in the same day. It had been about a decade since I last saw it, before BCG contacted me about review it. I had always planned on re-watching it, but I had been putting it off. There’s always this underlying fear I have about re-watching things that I loved when I was much younger. A fear that things that I used to love will be ruined my older self, who has vastly different tastes than my younger counterpart. But, I finally sat down and watched it again. Does Castle in the Sky hold up to my sky high childhood expectations, or does it start looking worse when I take off my nostalgia glasses? \\n\\nStory:\\n\\nCastle in the Sky’s story starts off in the only place that would make sense, the sky. A girl named Sheeta is traveling aboard an airship that is suddenly attacked by pirates. For some reason, the pirates seem to be interested in her. In her desperate attempt to escape, she falls from the airship, and begins plummeting to the ground. But, the crystal necklace that she’s wearing starts glowing mysteriously, and her rapid decent to the ground below is slowed to a crawl. She is spotted by Pazu, a young man from the mining town that she was falling into. Shortly after she awakes from her slumber, she and Pazu discover that the pirates have followed her and are after the crystal on her necklace. Which, they believe, will lead them to the legendary floating city of Laputa, and the treasure that lies within it. \\n\\nCastle in the Sky manages to accomplish something in two hours that some anime haven’t been able to do in double, triple, or exponentially more amounts of time: tell a compelling narrative with a beginning, middle, climax, and an end. The problem is that not all of the elements were executed properly. I wanted to give the movie credit for what it was able to do in such a short time frame, but, at the same time, you could definitely tell that things were a little rushed—in terms of its narrative. The movie’s world building was adequate, but you never really get a good sense of exactly how things are presently, and how things will be in the future, which I’ll get to when I talk about the movie’s ending. Castle in the Sky has to fill you in as the movie progress, which leaves you with a lot of unanswered questions while you’re watching it. Fortunately, most of those questions are answered by the end of the movie, but some of those answers feel, well, unsatisfying. Sometimes the answers to the questions you’ve had about the world only lead to more questions. Minor questions, but still. And even if the questions are answered, you may questions the reasoning behind some of it. Such as: why did this person do this, why didn’t they do that, or couldn’t they have found a better use for this? \\n\\nThe story also has to rely on a lot of plot convenience in order to get things started. Things will just so happened to work out in just the right way, at just the right time, for our protagonists to accomplish their goal. Most likely a product of their limited time, but it can get a little annoying. \\n\\nCastle in the Sky’s ending isn’t very good. Sure, it ends the adventure that Pazu and Sheeta are currently on, but what happens next? Your guess is as good as mine. The movie ends fairly abruptly, and leaves you with some pretty significant unanswered questions. \\n\\nWith all of that being said, I still really liked the story. The fact is that it’s incredibly straightforward. It’s not very deep, or thought provoking it, but that probably wasn’t what it was meant to be either. It’s a short, and enjoyable tale of adventure, and friendship. \\n\\nCharacters: \\n\\nThe characters are probably the worst part of this movie. That’s not to say that the characters are bad, they’re just nothing special. Yeah, they’re likeable. Some of them are really likeable, but they all have little to no character development or background information. This is especially true, and disappointing, of our protagonists Pazu and Sheeta. Pazu is probably the most developed character is the entire movie, which isn’t saying a whole lot, and Sheeta is, essentially, Princess Peach for a good portion of the movie. We are given some background information about each of them, as rushed as those moments were, especially Pazu’s… \\n\\nThe supporting characters, on the other hand, received virtually none of the above with only a few of them receiving any sort of development, and only the main villain is given some sort of background story. And while we’re talking about main villain, I have to mention that his motivations are…less than compelling. He’s not exactly the best villain I’ve ever seen, but he serves his purpose, I guess. \\n\\nAnimation:\\n\\nI’ve always found that it’s harder for me to review the animation of older anime because it’s not really what I’m used to, and because I’m not sure if I should hold the animation to a different set of standards or adjust my expectations. But, that wasn’t really a problem with Castle in the Sky. I really liked the art style that the anime used. I think that, if it was made today, it would still be made in a similar style simply because it just really fits the general tone and feeling of the movie. The character models are all distinct and really well drawn, and the background scenery was also really well done. There are some of great looking fantasy landscape shots that you can’t help but gawk at. \\nThe actions scenes are also really well done. They were smoothly animated and a treat to watch. I do want to give special praise to the movie’s explosions. I don’t know why they stood out to me by the end of the movie, but they looked awesome. \\n\\nSound:\\n\\nWhen I was younger, I never really gave the movie’s soundtrack any thought. It never even crossed my mind. But, this time around, it was one of the first things I noticed. The grand orchestral pieces that fit the tone and setting of every scene that they are used in. Whether it’s an intense scene with gripping action and high stakes, or a quiet night under the moonlight. The only complaint that I have about it is that there are a lot of tracks that have a similar sound. That being said, there are plenty of songs in Castle in the Sky’s OST that I can see myself returning to fairly frequently. \\n\\nEnjoyment:\\n\\nEven without my nostalgia glasses on, I thoroughly enjoyed Castle in the Sky. It’s a flawed, but captivating tale with likeable characters, and really good animation and sound. It took me nearly a decade to re-watch this movie the last time, but I doubt it’ll take me anywhere near as long to observe Pazu and Sheeta’s exciting journey again.\\n\\nVerdict &amp; Breakdown:\\nStory: 3.2/5\\nCharacters: 3/5\\nAnimation: 4/5\\nSound: 4/5\\nEnjoyment: 3.9/5\\nVerdict: 3.6/5',\n",
       "  'Last week I was fortunate enough to watch one of the most highly regarded and critically praised anime series, called Elfen Lied. Why this series has garnered so much popularity over the years is surely no surprise to anyone: ask anybody who watches anime on a regular basis about the bloodiest, most disturbing series and you’ll often get Elfen Lied as the answer. This series is far from a simple no-brainer gorefest, though, and those who dare give it a shot (it’s certainly not for those who can’t stomach this type of thing) may find themselves completely overwhelmed by its beautifully unique story and memorablecharacters. I should know, as I am one of them.\\n\\nFirst thing’s first: let me give you a little insight on the plot of the series. Elfen Lied primarily focuses on the relationship between humans and the so-called Diclonius (humans with horns attached to their heads and equipped with invisible telekinetic arms). One of our main characters, Lucy, is a Diclonius girl who escapes from a research facility where those of her kind are held captive and experimented upon in violent ways. Make no mistake, these strange, yet intriguing beings are far from innocent – most of them do not back away from violence and getting on their bad side can often result in a bloodbath. After forcing her way out (and by that I mean violently dismembering and ripping the heads off of everyone that stands in the way), Lucy is shot in the very last moment by a sniper. The shot doesn’t entirely hit, but it does damage her head enough to cause a deep amnesia and split her personality in two parts. Not much time passes and Lucy is found on a nearby beach by Kohta and his cousin Yuka, but Lucy’s second personality, Nyu, has taken over and this results in her acting like a child and unable to remember anything that happened up to that point.\\n\\nMost of the show focuses on Lucy’s stay with Kohta and Yuka and the hunt by those whom she evaded to recapture her. Calling Elfen Lied the bloodiest and goriest anime series ever made is more an opinion rather than a fact, but it is certainly up there. You can tell from the first ten minutes that it definitely lives up to its reputation: Lucy’s escape from the research facility is one of the most powerful and downright disturbing scenes I have ever since in any anime series and it contained more blood and violence than I was prepared for – and believe me, I was pretty prepared.\\n\\nOne of the first things which caught my attention when I started watching the series was its opening song, called Lilium, which is sung in Latin. I was immediately fascinated by its truly wonderful tone and the atmosphere which it evoked. The opening couldn’t have been more fitting, if you ask me. It really captures the essence of what this anime is about.\\n\\nElfen Lied may sport a brutal attitude and at times it seems as though there is little to stop it from going way over the edge with its graphic depictions of violence and gore, but beyond its hardened exterior lies a soft and sensible core. The relationships between characters are surprisingly genuine and feel really natural. Over the course of its running time we come to care for each and every character in a special way. No one is innocent here, but it’s the imperfections and the little things that each character says or the does that shapes them into perfectly developed characters. I wish I could say that Elfen Lied does all these things to perfection, but there are some noticeable flaws among these beautifully executed aspects. Some characters react in an odd way to a few things, which sometimes leads to confusion among the audience and incapability to connect with the particular scene when it happens. For example, a young girl discovers a brutally dismembered man on the beach and her reaction suggests that she thinks little of it. Such things really lead to confusion and sometimes ruin the moment. I don’t wanna spoil anything, so I’ll just say that Kohta goes through some extremely emotional situations during the last episodes and his reactions are underwhelming, to say the least.\\n\\nWith only thirteen episodes and one special original video animation, Elfen Lied is a relatively short anime series. The manga it is based on is said to continue beyond the series’ ending and offer a lot more backstory and information about some characters, though I have not read it and am therefore unable to comment on the matter. I will say this, though: as far as the anime is concerned, it does a great job at developing the characters and advancing the story in a satisfying manner for the audience.\\n\\nElfen Lied is most definitely not for the faint of heart. There are lots of scenes which depict violence against animals, incest and even sexual abuse. Even though the series is filled with controversy and gore, it does manage to deliver a really beautiful and emotional story filled with interesting, well-developed characters. I was a little bit disappointed with the open ending and the final episode overall, but it did little to make me forget about the rest of this spectacular anime series. If you feel like you’ve got the stomach for it, be sure to check it out as it will definitely leave a lasting mark on you. It certainly did so in my case.',\n",
       "  '(Potentially Spoilerific)I began watching Akame ga kill recently, after a long hiatus from anime in general caused mostly by the trials and tribulations of adult life. My time is more precious than it\\'s ever been and I have a limited amount of time for BS. Akame ga kill is BS. This is simply one of the worst shows I\\'ve ever seen, the only reason I stuck it out to the end was because I wanted to see how horribly bad it could get. From the get-go, the show is confused, it doesn\\'t know whether it\\'s telling a serious and meaningful story or whether it\\'s justmaking fun of itself. A number of moments in the show that are supposed to be heart-wrenching or intended to leave a lasting impression are cheapened by silly one liners, tropes, and awful humour. \\n\\nThe shows humour isn\\'t even original, don\\'t come here if you\\'re after comedy. The same old recycled cliches are thrown at you. \\n\\nAkame ga Kill isn\\'t afraid to kill of its main characters - this is usually a good thing, but in akame ga kill it\\'s almost a testament to how awful the show really is. The show fails to form a connection between the viewer and the characters. Summarily, they\\'ll die and you won\\'t care because they\\'re such one dimensional recycled clones.\\n\\nThe show\\'s \"unique\" blend of humour and violence is almost disturbing. As is their glorification of what are essentially terrorists. Issues like this aren\\'t black and white though, there is rarely an \"entirely evil empire\" and an \"entirely good group of assassins\" the first few episodes really cement this paradigm as the various members of Night Raid confront one dimensional power rangers baddy X Y and Z before being given a bunch of Night Raid clones to fight against.\\n\\nIn terms of action, the battles are unbelievable and badly choreographed. Although the show kills its characters it does not maintain a shred of credibility when it comes to how strong people are, or how they fare against one another, it\\'s all quite random. It\\'s the sort of thing you\\'d spoon feed to a 3 year old making airplane noises and expect them to swallow. \\n\\nI\\'m going to end this review now and throw up. I really feel like throwing up now, that\\'s how bad this is.',\n",
       "  'If there was one word to describe this anime, that word would be \"brutal\". From the very first scene to the last, Texhnolyze constantly punishes it\\'s characters and the world that it has created. This may make it sound like an unnecessarily harsh anime, it\\'s quite the opposite. Texhnolyze is about the protagonist\\'s growth and search for happiness in the darkest times. Texhnolyze is set in a believable future where the world has been corrupted by a convoluted political system where the privileged have replaced limbs with prosthetics that can surpass regular human function. This sounds like the usual cyberpunk anime and while it does carrysimilarities with Ergo Proxy (Ergo Proxy was released a few years later), this is a very unique take on how humankind attempts to continue as a species.\\n\\nThe pacing for Texhnolyze begins incredibly slowly with the first episode having almost no dialogue at all. However don\\'t let that dissuade you. Texhnolyze has an ability to tell it\\'s story without being pretentious, nor does it insult your intelligence by making things obvious. The story builds each episode, adding layer upon layer until suddenly the anime is pure chaos.\\n\\nThe art and sound for Texhnolyze is superb. Every song used throughout the series sets the tone of the scene, usually giving a feeling of dread, emptiness or suffering. In fact, I enjoy the soundtrack so much that I now own it. The art is also done well. Each character is unique, the action is animated well while not being over the top to detract from the main storyline and the different settings are easy to tell apart. The soundtrack and art style are used well together to emphasize the themes involved in every scene.\\n\\nThe characters themselves are done well. Each character is important to the plot, explored in depth and memorable. There are no clear good guys or bad guys, instead Texhnolyze leaves the audience to try to make sense of the characters by themselves. The protagonist however can be a bit frustrating for some as he rarely ever speaks. Personally I did not have a problem with him though.\\n\\nTexhnolyze is one of my favourite animes. However it is not for everyone. The action is not spectacular, the characters are not straightforward and the themes of the show are mostly quite depressing. Instead of aiming to tell an entertaining story, Texhnolyze tries to be thought provoking, leaving the viewer to ask questions such as \"what makes living important?\" and \"can humans find happiness even if the future is bleak?\". For anyone who does enjoy something complex, thought provoking and is prepared to put their mind to work while watching an anime, then Texhnolyze is perfect for you. But if you are looking to relax, avoid this series.',\n",
       "  'I\\'m a frequenter of /a/, so I\\'ve always heard that Clannad is one of the sadder series on that end of the spectrum, but I can\\'t really be sure as I\\'ve never seen it. I\\'ve also heard both Clannad and Ano Hana referred to as \"forced drama shit\". I don\\'t know about Clannad, but I can vouch for Ano Hana when I say if you actually watch it until the end, it is particularly heart-wrenching and nothing to me felt forced at all. In fact, Ano Hana hit me particularly hard. It is a tangle of (innocently enough) childhood love triangles hidden beneath a tragedythat everyone carries with them for years.\\n\\nThe best (and I guess worst, in it\\'s own right) part about Ano Hana is that it has a really human feel to it at a lot of points. It\\'s hard not to sympathize and relate when just about everyone has lost someone dear to them and wished that they could go back and and appreciate that time a little more, wished they could say something important to them. I don\\'t know about you, but I know that feel pretty well.\\n\\nAll in all there was not a lot I can really complain about, there was a lot I really liked about it. For instance, I absolutely loved that though it wasn\\'t apparent from the beginning, the answer they needed for her wish was in the opening theme but it wasn\\'t obvious until the last few episodes.\\n\\nI also felt that most of the characters were very fleshed out and had their flaws. After Menma\\'s death, Jinta became a hikkikimori, Yukiatsu found some... eccentric ways to mourn, Poppo traveled the world, Tsuruko clung onto Yukiatsu but felt contempt over the fact that he could not get over Menma. And I dunno, Anaru became a conceited bitch trying to take Menma\\'s place?? To each his own I guess.\\n\\nI loved guessing throughout the show what Menma\\'s wish was, but also dreaded them finding out, as they would ultimately lose her for a second time and make it even more painful. I also liked that they avoided something anime can be very guilty of-- everyone believing something at the tip of a hat. Everyone but Poppo really doubted that Menma was back and following Jinta around, Yukiatsu denied it almost until the very end! While it was frustrating sometimes to see his ignorance towards it after just about everyone else believed Jinta but him, I felt that it really kept his character intact, unwavering from what he believed and unable to forgive or believe Jinta after Menma\\'s death.\\n\\nWhile I can\\'t say much about \"enjoyment\\' because, well, I don\\'t think I\\'d watch it again knowing I\\'ll bawl for an hour during the last two episodes, I thought it was a very engrossing series and I liked that it sent me through a whirlwind of emotions--once. I made the mistake of watching the last episode and cried and cried just like I had months before when I\\'d watched it originally. I don\\'t think I could watch it again-- my heart can\\'t take it.\\n\\nOverall, I loved the show, the characters were mostly well fleshed out, I paid no attention to the soundtrack unfortunately aside from the op, the art was nice (but what kinda kid has white hair?? whatever, she was adorable and pure) and I would try to avoid watching it again myself but it at least deserves one watch--hopefully one you won\\'t soon forget!',\n",
       "  'Makoto Shinkai\\'s works tend to revolve around melancholy themes such as longing and loneliness. I\\'ve watched some of his stuff before, namely \"She and Her Cat\" and \"Voices of a Distant Star\", and in those cases, I feel the frameworks in which he chose to express himself were stumbling blocks. In \"She and Her Cat\", the concept of a cat being in love with his owner was not one I could take seriously within the short length of that anime; as for \"Voices of a Distant Star\", the gimmicky use of mobile phone communication that\\'s at the heart of it gets more absurd the moreI think about it.\\n\\nIn \"5 Centimeters per Second\" though, Shinkai takes those same themes and embeds them into a very ordinary premises: two initally close friends growing apart as the physical distance between them became larger and larger due to circumstances beyond their control. There are no fantasy or sci-fi gimmicks here; everything clicks together seamlessly and is for once believable. Because of this, \"5 Centimeters per Second\" is my favourite out of Shinkai\\'s works. (Because I come from a scientific background, I will now proceed to efficiently express the title of this anime as \"5 cm/s\" for the remainder of the review.)\\n\\n5 cm/s is split into three episodes. The first time round, I watched the anime as three separate episodes with breaks in between. I later rewatched it as a continuous movie, and found it worked much better, because the connections between the episodes came out more strongly, and the 3rd episode didn\\'t seem so jarringly short.\\n\\nThe first episode, \"Cherry Blossom\", is an endearing tale of puppy love, and is the strongest segment of the movie. Not only does it sets up the premise and introduce Takaki and Akari, the main subjects of the story, it also establishes the main theme. It\\'s in this episode that we learn the meaning of 5 cm/s - it\\'s rumoured to be the speed at which cherry blossoms fall, which in turn is a metaphor for people slowly drifting apart, and those delicate, beautiful moments in life that seem to end all too soon.\\n\\nThe story begins with the Takaki and Akari already separated. The narrative interlaces events from the past, when the two were classmates as well as the closest of friends in elementary school, and the present, in which Takaki, who is about to move even further away, gets on the train to visit Akari, possibly for the last time. The entwining narrative is further supplemented by unconventional dialogue made up of Akari\\'s letters to Takaki during their separation, and Takaki\\'s introspective responses and reflections. In this way, the initially fragmented picture becomes increasingly clear as the episode progresses.\\n\\nWhen it comes to setting the mood, I generally find the audio to be a more important component than the visuals. However, 5 cm/s showed me this isn\\'t always the case. Though the wistful music and sombre narration did much to enhance the experience, the art plays at least a big a part. The sceneries are magnificent, with ones such as cherry blossom filled spring and desolate, snowy landscapes helping to invoke emotions like the soft glow of nostalgia and feelings of loneliness and despair. Sometimes, less is more; the beauty and sense of poetry may also be prevalent in other Shinkai works that I\\'ve seen, but it\\'s only here in this most simplistic of scenarios that the aforementioned qualities truly gain substance. The story may just be about a long and dull train journey, but it\\'s a journey that\\'s charged with anxiety.\\n\\nThe second episode \"Cosmonaut\" shows Takaki in high school, but the story is actually told from the point of view of a classmate, Kanae, who happens to have a crush on him and is looking for an opportunity to confess.\\n\\nPerhaps the most remarkable thing about \"Cosmonaut\" is that it somehow manages to push the visuals up a further notch. The most beautiful of every day scenery - red-gold sunsets, clouds blown across a dazzling blue sky - are selected, and their brilliance captured in the astonishing artwork. Despite the lack of sci-fi/fantasy elements, Shinkai still found a way to lift the restrictions on his imagination, bringing forth flashes of surreal imagery breathtaking in their outlandish colours and unearthly beauty. If the age rating of movies took into account scenery pr0n, then this scenery hentai of an anime would no doubt be classed as an 18.\\n\\nThough the story of \"Cosmonaut\" seems like a mostly independent segment, viewing it as part of the whole movie strengthens certain elements within it and helps to give a sense of overarching purpose to the movie. Through this episode, we begin to get a picture of how Takaki lived his life after being separated from Akari, and of his constant pining for something that\\'s beyond his reach.\\n\\nThe picture becomes complete in the final episode which shares the title of the movie. This episode is a lot shorter than the others. It features Takaki and Akari all grown up, and takes a glimpse into their respective lives.\\n\\nAt the heart of the episode is a chance meeting at a railway crossing. There\\'s a montage at the end which rudely kicks in and disrupts the flow of the narrative. The topic of the song used in the montage is very appropriate, but the song\\'s loudness, or at least the relative loudness of its introduction, contrasts poorly with the understated mood. Also, I don\\'t think it added much value, since the movie had already said everything it needed to say up to that point. I think Shinkai REALLY wanted to use the song for its relevant lyrics, and ended up nailing it on as part of an un-needed montage. As the awful montage comes to an end though, we are treated to a most meaningful ending that resolved the earlier scene at the crossing. This scene may look simple, but it\\'s actually representative of the very core of what the whole movie is about, and it\\'s just the perfect ending for 5 cm/s.\\n\\nOther than the montage, the movie does have a few other issues, mostly to do with the characters. Firstly, the design of the characters are a bit lacking, especially compared to the level of detail found in the scenery. This complaint also extends to the personality of the characters themselves - they can seem a little flat and overly pensive. Takaki, being the central focus of the movie, suffers from this in particular. Apart from his tendency to brood, he seems to be almost devoid of any other personality traits; he feels too much like a plain vessel created soley for the housing of the melancholy feelings in the movie. As a result, rather than being character driven like it should be, 5 cm/s feels more emotionally driven.\\n\\nStill, these flaws aren\\'t too glaring because of how short the movie is. Taking everything into account, 5 cm/s is still a very fine movie. And that\\'s coming from someone who\\'s not a big fan of Shinkai\\'s works.',\n",
       "  \"I will try keep this short, understandable, and not too long for some viewers who just want to know a short opinion about the anime, and not a detailed essay (no offence intended to other reviewers) STORY: The main theme in 5cm is distant love; the story in 5cm is typical in most animes. However, Shinkai Makoto has not only created something with deeper meaning but has also transformed how we watch anime. The story is divided into three arcs, each telling a different story at a different time. The story mainly revolves around a boy/man name Takaki and his long time childhood friend, Akira. Thestory is beautiful, with a great ending. \\n\\nART:\\nWhat can I say?  Shinkai Makoto has done it again! The art in 5cm isn't just intruding, but it is also realistic. From the flickering reflections in the train to the detailed buildings and characters. The art just blends in with the story beautifully, just seeing the art just makes me want to watch this over and over again.\\n\\nSOUND:\\nThe music in 5cm perfectly blends in with the atmosphere of the anime, you feel as if you are in the movie. The music somehow manages to smoothly merge the viewer and the anime together. The sound effects fulfills its purpose by providing realistic sounds such as the perfectly executed train noises. Although the music does not play a major role in the first two episodes, the ending music is just amazing; it really makes you synthesis for the characters.\\n\\nCHARACTER:\\nAs you continue to watch 5cm, you are immediately drawn into the characters, as mentioned above; the story is divided into three arcs. One in his childhood days, one in his high school days and the last in his adulthood days. Each arc all contain the main character, Takaki and as the story continues characters revolve around him. \\n\\nENJOYMENT:\\nAlthough I have only watched this once, it has already left an impact on me. The art, sound and the overall story pulled me into the movie. I really enjoyed this movie to a point that I wrote a review on it. ^^ \\n\\nOVERALL:\\nShinkai Makoto has not only created a movie with outstanding art and music but also combined the elements of Romance and Drama into one heck of a movie. \\n\\n\\n10/10\",\n",
       "  '\"To the well organized mind, death is but the next adventure.\" - J.K. Rowling I joined MyAnimeList yesterday, and today I write my first review about one of my favorite animes. In truth, it is only the first because of alphabetical order, but as I sink into my memories of the story and soundtrack, I think its appropriate I begin with this one. .:.: Story -- 9 :.:. Angel Beats is about the struggle. Not fights and certainly not the ideals behind them. The setting makes it very clear that it\\'s too late for such things. It\\'s about what to do along their struggle for happiness when not evendeath can spare them of it. Everyone gathered in this setting have had a terrible life. Their cries for help gone unheard. And their worst nightmares came true.\\n\\nThe premise is that people with horrible lives are brought together through supernatural means for unknown reasons and must struggle against a terrifying supernatural existance: the \"Tenshi\". Which literally translates to \"Angel\" in english. In the afterlife, where death means only taking a short nap, they continually struggle what seems to be a hopeless fight with constant physical pain of enduring Tenshi\\'s powers and their own psychological problems from their past, miserable lives.\\n\\nWhat particularly strikes me is how the perspective given from the start (our dear protagonist, Otonashi Yuzuru) is that a emotionless supernatural being is out to enslave them, or worse. Out of desperation and being attacked by her after exchanging very few words, Yuzuru agrees to join the SSS (\"Shinda Sekai Sensen\" or Afterlife Battlefront, if you prefer). But thorughout his adventures he comes to realize that despite how easily they can manipulate things in the afterlife, the reality of life itself remains the same: they must cope with their struggles, both past and present.\\n\\nI think the message of the story was that communication between people is truly priceless. Words alone can indeed save people.\\n\\n\\n\\n.:.: Art -- 9 :.:.\\n\\nThe art here is first-class fit for a first-class story. Whether it be the wild chases along the beautiful looking afterlife setting, the eye-catching lighting effects with indoors and otherwise, and the character designs themselves. All of them can be summarized with words like \"cool\" or \"beautiful\" if not both.\\n\\n\\n\\n.:.: Sound -- 10 :.:.\\n\\nAngel Beats\\' soundtrack is second to none in the universe of anime. There are noteworthy and/or memorable individual opening themes, tracks and ending themes in many animes out there, but very rarely is the package deal as great this. I dare say that there are only soundtracks AS GOOD as Angel Beats. You can clearly notice the detail and love put into each of them; it\\'s as good as it gets. Hell, Girls DeMo? The musical group within the cast of characters? They\\'re an ACTUAL BAND that had their debut in this show. Those are the reasons I hold Angel Beats\\' OST in the highest regard. The members are the voice actors for each respective character. How much more awesome can it get? To me, it can\\'t.\\n\\n\\n\\n.:.: Characters -- 9 :.:.\\n\\nSince about 50% of any story progresses in regards to the protagonists and antagonists, it\\'s only fair I leave no stone unturned here. Or it would be, but this just so happens to be one of the cases where the back stories of the characters are the ultimate spoilers. And unfortunately so, because while Angel Beats deserves its reviewers to look over all details. What I can tell you is this: the \"emotional truth\" captured by this show is very impressive.\\n\\nBut their painful pasts aside, there is much to enjoy at face value. They really are that good. Yuzuru suffers from amnesia and goes by means the others in the SSS consider \"too radical\" to recover them, so far as to attempt communicating with \"Tenshi\".\\n\\nYuri, the leader of SSS, is the unwavering dedicated leader who suspiciously spends a lot of time alone sorting out her thoughts and burdens. It grows even more interesting given how she was given a position of leadership at a young age, and the cost was the curse of the afterlife she shares with the rest of the cast.\\n\\n\\n\\n.:.: Enjoyment -- 10 :.:.\\n\\nI don\\'t think I need to say anything to justify this. It\\'s purely subjective, I know, but I don\\'t think any more needs to be said after I\\'ve spent so much time evangelizing everything else for you, my dear reader. I wrote all of this because I really think everyone who reads this should watch the show.\\n\\n\\n\\n.:.: Overall -- 9.4 :.:.\\n\\nAngel Beats earns a rank of 94% awesome in my book, and I hope you enjoy it just as much as I did.',\n",
       "  \"Obscured by a veil of feathers, a boy floating above a sacrificial altar is warned by a crow that if he rejects the faith even once, the gates of Heaven will forever stay closed to him. The boy responds by saying that if he was truly among the faithful in the first place, he never would’ve summoned the crow. The two parties then make a contract and the screen fades to black so that the intro can start playing. Immediately after the intro however, we’re treated to the same child waking up for the morning and a tall, handsome man in a jet black suitas his enigmatic butler performing his duties. After the title card pops up, we’re then treated to the comedic antics of his other servants styled like it was ripped straight out of Fullmetal Alchemist.\\n\\nThe above paragraph sums up the first 5 minutes of the first episode of this show. If that doesn’t sound particularly appealing to you, well… I don’t blame you. The 2008 Black Butler anime is many things and being a master of mood whiplash is one of them. When the whole Black Butler hype train came around here stateside back in 2010 when Funimation licensed the anime, I honestly wasn’t even that interested to begin with. I was all about Naruto, Bleach, and One Piece at that point in time and so a show about some kid with an eyepatch and his hypercompetent demon butler didn’t really catch my eye.\\n\\nWhen I did give this show a chance in mid-2014 just a few months before Book of Circus came out, I came out of this particular anime feeling rather… hollow. There were bits and pieces of a truly amazing story to be found, but I had to dig through mountains of bullshit just to even find it in the first place. The very beginning of the pilot episode implied that this entire anime would be a Faustian tragedy and well… it is on some measure, but the finished product that we ended up getting seemed to try so many different things and just failed miserably at all of them.\\n\\nObviously in the current year, I’ve long since watched every single Black Butler anime ever released, caught up to the manga, and indeed, have written reviews of some of the Black Butler instalments that I’ve read or watched. Still, the 2008 series sticks out in my mind the most because A-1 Pictures still intends for this anime to be the starting point for newcomers to the franchise. That’s actually pretty fucking baffling when you consider how little of this anime actually follows the manga.\\n\\nOfficially, we’re expected to watch up to episode 15 and then start watching everything from Book of Circus onward. HOWEVER, only episodes 2-6 and 13-15 are actually necessary to comprehend everything from Book of Circus going forward. Everything else is well… filler! Okay, it’s not actually filler since the rest of those episodes tie in with the second half of this anime but uh… why would you want to watch it? Rhetorical question of course because there actually are many reasons to watch the second half of this show. But those reasons have a pretty fucking huge warning label over them: don’t expect anything that makes sense.\\n\\nOriginally when I first watched this anime without any prior context on the manga, on the upcoming adaptations, or any of that other stuff, I kinda liked it. Upon retrospect, that was because the anime decided to stop the stupid gag comedy and actually try taking itself seriously. The problem here of course was that the show started taking itself seriously far too late into its run and because of that, a lot of the plot felt like it was strung along until the 24 episode mark where it just ends. I still felt that way at the time, but I felt like I had to give the show credit for actually going out and doing its own thing. I mean, a lot of shows nowadays are terrible because they try to play it so safe and then end up becoming faceless, mediocre garbage. I certainly respect an artist that actually tries to take risks, especially in an industry where profit margins were already low to begin with.\\n\\nWhile I still maintain that position on some level, I’ve also come to realise that it’s dangerous to romanticise risk-taking because of the fact that disastrous results from failed gambles often ruin the overall integrity of the project in question. Even if a project is successful with most of the risks that they take, the few that do fail become especially noticeable. I absolutely adore the 2003 Fullmetal Alchemist anime and the risks that show took did pay off to me, but there were some parts that ultimately fell extremely flat because the gamble they took didn’t pay off.\\n\\nUnfortunately, A-1 Pictures didn’t have the tact of Bones in this regard. One of the most irksome parts of Black Butler is how heavy-handed the show is with its fanservice. It’s no secret that Black Butler has a huge fujoshi fanbase and it’s also no secret that Yana Toboso originally intended to make Black Butler a yaoi series before deciding against it. If this anime is any indication of what Black Butler would’ve been like as a yaoi series, I’m fucking grateful that Toboso decided against it.\\n\\nThe most uncomfortable aspect of this show for me is the amount of yaoi subtext that A-1 Pictures added to Ciel and Sebastian’s relationship. It was like that when I first started watching it and it’s still that way a good 6 years after the fact. Surprising though it may seem, the manga actually didn’t have much in the way of subtext between Ciel and Sebastian. In fact, it actually went through great pains to show the exact opposite. Their relationship in the manga is actually one of grudgingly mutual respect.\\n\\nCiel’s horrifying past led to him losing any faith he had left in God and his apostasy led to Sebastian being beckoned. It’s explicitly stated that the kinds of people who summon demons aren’t always like Ciel, so of course Sebastian is interested. The terms of the contract are stacked against Sebastian in that he must never lie, he must have unquestioning loyalty to Ciel, and that he must always protect him no matter what. What’s more is that Ciel’s contract seal is on his eye and it’s stated that in Episode 4 that the more visible the seal is, the stronger the contract is. Ciel knows that Sebastian will act like a monkey’s paw if his orders aren’t explicit enough, and yet he has security in the fact that Sebastian’s extremely good at his job, won’t ever betray him, and won’t ever lie to him.\\n\\nThese would ordinarily be terrible terms for a demon to live under, but Sebastian did so anyway. From his perspective, a once-innocent child was willing to sell his soul to a demon to live. You don’t don’t often find masters like that, so that’s one point for him to stay. Next, Ciel’s fundamental distrust of others allowed him to see through any potential demonic trickery on Sebastian’s part. Given how the typical Faustian protagonist is some dumbass who trades away his soul for something stupid like money, power, sex, or what have you, it’s no surprise to think that Sebastian would be interested in dealing with a master who has some degree of foresight. Finally, we have the fact that Ciel’s duties as the Earl of Phantomhive regularly exposes him to the absolute worst that humanity has to offer. Mind you, Ciel is a child and he hasn’t come out of every encounter completely unscathed. From a demon’s point-of-view, such trauma at a young age only for more to follow as he gets older is effectively the same as his own dinner cooking itself.\\n\\nIn short: Ciel and Sebastian have to put a great amount of trust in one another due to the nature of their contract. Their relationship isn’t devoid of conflict since Sebastian acts like a monkey’s paw and Ciel doesn’t always have the best temper despite usually maintaining a level head. Even if the contract didn’t exist in the picture, there’s a mutual respect between the two because well… Sebastian’s good at his job as both Ciel’s butler and primary caretaker and Ciel’s pretty self aware about his own morality and feels obligated to continue his march into the abyss because he’s already come this far.\\n\\nGiven *all* of that context into Ciel and Sebastian’s relationship, it comes off as especially revolting as A-1 Pictures tries to really hammer home the idea of SebaCiel. To be absolutely fair here, there are moments in the manga that do come close to crossing the line (i.e. Sebastian cradling Ciel when he has a traumatic flashback to the cult during the Circus arc). However, the line was never fully crossed because such moments in the manga always had the context shown to be Sebastian only comforting his master at the bare minimum necessary so that he doesn’t go insane.\\n\\nAny remotely intimate moment between Ciel and Sebastian in the anime doesn’t have this context. Instead, it just comes off as if Sebastian’s grooming Ciel. To be absolutely fair here, it’s not like there isn’t a concept for demons who prey upon children sexually or otherwise. Indeed, countless cultures across the world have some idea of a supernatural force preying upon children. The thing is though that the anime doesn’t really run with the idea of Sebastian having a vested interest in Ciel beyond the contract. There’s still some effort put in to show that Sebastian ultimately cares more about the contract than he does about Ciel, but it doesn’t really go anywhere. In the end, all we really get is one episode where Sebastian ends the episode as a hypercompetent butler followed up by another where A-1 Pictures wanted to give the fujoshis a reason to buy the BD sets.\\n\\nI know I’ve been bitching about this for a while, but it really must be said just how much this detracts from the overall experience. The initial impression from the very first episode, and indeed, some of the most iconic moments across both halves of the anime (i.e. everything involving Jack the Ripper, Ciel’s own awareness of how fucked up his life is, the backstories of the Phantomhive servants and their reasons for their undying loyalty to Ciel, etc) show bits and pieces of a truly fantastic show that just ends up getting buried under all of the additional shit that A-1 Pictures put on top of it.\\n\\nNow we get into the second half of the anime’s story and boy, where the fuck do I begin? I would imagine that Yana wasn’t particularly involved in the writing process for the second half of the season beyond a few vague hints at things that would later happen in the manga. A-1 Pictures had 9 episodes to wrap everything up and considering how the manga’s well past the 160 chapter mark with no sign of stopping any time soon, it’s no secret that it doesn’t bode well for the overall quality of these episodes.\\n\\nUpon rewatching for the first time in well over 6 years, I can’t really say I finished the season enjoying it as much as I once did. The biggest problem with the second half of the show is that it throws so much information at you at once without any inkling of foreshadowing or consideration for character interactions. There’s a point where Ciel ends up finding the cult who tortured and defiled him before Sebastian was beckoned, and not once are we treated to any sign of visible trauma on Ciel’s part during the whole proceeding! Why?! The manga didn’t really touch upon the cult specifically beyond the backstory needed to show Ciel and Sebastian’s first encounter. I’d actually be pretty down to see Ciel actually investigating the cult and his own reactions to the faces that traumatised him. But no, it’s yet another missed opportunity.\\n\\nAs far as the ending is concerned, it was lukewarm for me. By the time I finished the show, so much had happened so fast to the point where I kinda just wanted to be done with it. I would say that it’s a pretty definite conclusion, but we all know at this point in time that Black Butler II completely and totally shits upon that notion. Still, I’d like to think that Black Butler II didn’t happen and that the finale of the 2008 show is the more fitting conclusion to the anime’s continuity. I’ll write up another rant on Black Butler II, so I’ll cut myself off here.\\n\\nCharacter-wise, we don’t really have much to go off of here. While the anime is *supposed* to be adapting the first 23 chapters of the manga which actually provides a great deal of character context and development, we already established that the anime doesn’t actually do this well at all. In the end, the Phantomhive servants sans Sebastian are treated as comic relief, Elizabeth is more of a burden on Ciel rather than his actual fiance, Grell is comedy relief and also Sebastian’s biggest fan, the other reapers just… exist and don’t come into the anime’s story unless the plot demands it, you get the idea.\\n\\nThe only two characters that actually had any effort put into their writing was Ciel and Sebastian, and honestly… Ciel’s portrayal isn’t even that good. Instead of being a relatively composed though still short-tempered child, Ciel is basically the spoiled brat that everyone who hates Black Butler thinks he is. Mind you, he’s certainly not in the same league as Alois Trancy is in Black Butler II but we shouldn’t use the core of the earth to judge what’s below the bottom of the barrel.\\n\\nCiel’s biggest problem throughout the 2008 anime is that he’s completely incapable of functioning without Sebastian at his side. While it is true that one of the terms of the contract is to protect Ciel no matter what, the practical reality of the situation is that Ciel’s duties as the Queen’s Watchdog make it difficult if not outright impossible for Sebastian to always be by Ciel’s side. \\n\\nIndeed, the manga actually does account for this and so any time that Ciel would likely be separated from Sebastian for any duration, they’d have the necessary preparation to take care of important tasks separately if needed. The manga actually shows that Ciel is a capable hunter, that he has some history of training with his future mother-in-law, and that he sleeps with a gun under his pillow and that he isn’t afraid of using it. Mind you, all of these details are revealed in Chapter 14 of the manga between the conclusion of Jack the Ripper and the beginning of the Curry arc, which technically this show is supposed to be adapting and yet Francis, Ciel’s future mother-in-law didn’t make her anime debut until Book of the Atlantic came out!\\n\\nComing back to this show knowing full well that Ciel should be capable of defending himself on some measure only to see that he really can’t and relies on Sebastian for everything is pretty fucking infuriating, not gonna lie. His overall demeanour isn’t noticeably different from that of his manga counterpart, but it differs just enough to piss me off. If Ciel had no desire for survival, he wouldn’t be the Earl of Phantomhive in the first place. That’s like Peter Parker being forced to learn responsibility from Nick Fury in the Ultimate Spider-Man cartoon: Peter Parker wouldn’t be Spider-Man if he didn’t already learn the lesson of responsibility from Uncle Ben’s death. Same concept.\\n\\nGiven all of the above, it does my heart some good to know that A-1 Pictures didn’t mess up Sebastian too much. Both in the manga and the anime, Sebastian is portrayed as a more elegant though admittedly less powerful counterpart to Alucard from Hellsing. He too is a supernatural accomplice to a greater mastermind, with all of the wit and sarcasm of a Victorian-era gentleman to boot. I would bring up the level of Sebastian’s power detracting from the overall experience of the show since he’s rarely in any real danger barring the later stages of the anime’s second half.\\n\\nStill, I just find our butler to the core so fucking enthralling whenever he’s on screen. Sebastian’s own charisma easily manages to make any otherwise boring bit about food, tea, or high society that much more entertaining whenever he’s in the frame. Sebastian’s own ruthless efficiency is nigh impossible for a human to accomplish and yet he’s purposely holding back from using any more supernatural power needed in order to maintain his cover as the Earl of Phantomhive’s faithful butler.\\n\\nGranted, it’s not like the manga really makes an attempt to explain why Sebastian does things the way a human would rather than simply using demon magic for everything. Indeed, we don’t get any such insight as to why that is until the middle of the Luxury Liner arc. Still, I’ve often theorised that Sebastian needed to maintain some cover so seeing that theory confirmed when I read the manga leads me to believe that the same can be said about Sebastian in the anime. Mind you, this is all speculation on my part but I have no reason to believe otherwise.\\n\\nThe anime-exclusive characters like Pluto, Ash, and the anime’s own version of Queen Victoria are better left to be experienced. I say this not because they’re pinnacles of character growth or development that deeply impacts the lore of the show as a whole. Rather, I say this because the show is so fucking incompetent to the point where these characters make absolutely no sense. A description isn’t really necessary since your reaction to them will give you all the information you really need for motives, investments, and so forth.\\n\\nNow that we have all of the story and characters out of the way, let’s talk at length about the superficial stuff! You know, animation, art direction, soundtrack, dubbing, that kind of thing. As far as the artwork and animation are concerned, Black Butler has aged phenomenally well. Then again, it’s no surprise considering how A-1 Pictures has always been really good at creating a visually stunning show. In fact, they’ve only gotten better as time went on if the anime from Book of Circus-onward is anything to go off of.\\n\\nThe overall colour palette of the show is fairly muted with lighter scenes having a light grey cast and darker scenes gravitating more toward the blacks and dark blues while also using shadow and limited lighting to great effect. Fairly fitting considering how this is a work taking place in Victorian England and I personally like it because it just adds to the overall Gothic atmosphere that the series both anime and manga strive to achieve.\\n\\nThe thing is though that Yana Toboso’s style involves blending together real life and the supernatural in such a way where it still stays true to the status of the time. The anime does do this as well, but some of their own additions like a shapeshifting naked bishonen with the brain of a wolf kinda detract from how grounded the artwork and animation is in relation to its setting. There’s also another thing that detracts from the overall quality of the animation: CGI.\\n\\nNow, A-1 Pictures is NOT Gonzo when it comes down to its usage of CGI. However, there are a number of scenes where the viewer is treated to an otherwise well-designed landscape marred only by a bunch of CG horses pulling CG carriages. Mind you, that is fairly minor on the list of transgressions (especially considering how the CG got even worse in Black Butler II) but it’s that nasty habit of A-1 Pictures where they give us such a visual delectation and yet there’s points where the budget got stretched and then there has to be an addition of a CG element to compensate. This is something that also happens in other A-1 shows like Sword Art Online, Your Lie in April, and of course, the other Black Butler animes.\\n\\nOn the subject of stretched budgets, I would imagine that the show tended to rely heavily on chibi gag humour because they’re simpler to draw and easier to animate than the more dramatic stuff which requires proper attention to detail. Make no mistake though, A-1 Pictures didn’t neglect these segments of the show at all. Indeed, the level of polish put into the anime’s gag humour shows a similar dedication that Bones had when they animated stuff like Fullmetal Alchemist, Brotherhood, Ouran HSHC, and so on. I often find myself watching compilations of the anime’s gags because the jokes themselves are actually pretty fucking funny in a vacuum since it’s not detracting from the show trying to take itself seriously.\\n\\nAs far as the audio side of things is concerned, I’m happy to say that the soundtrack has aged gracefully as well. Every background track fits the scene tremendously well and indeed there are many tracks that do stand out in my memory. The one background track that stuck with me the most however is a track called “Si Deus me Relinquit” which is Latin for “If God Has Forsaken Me.”\\n\\nThere genuinely aren’t enough words to describe just how much I love that particular song. If there was any song that could adequately describe what Black Butler actually is, then it’s this particular song. It starts off as a slow, sombre piece where a woman is vocalising the lyrics and it then slowly builds up until a Gregorian chant briefly comes into play. Then the orchestra takes over and turns it into a bombastic, yet also incredibly melancholic tune. This song alone manages to perfectly capture the sheer drama and also inevitable tragedy that Black Butler is all about. This song playing in the background of the show’s most serious moments alone almost makes me look past all of the uncomfortable subtext between Ciel and Sebastian that the anime tries to shoehorn.\\n\\nThe openings and the first ending are also some of my all-time favourite songs in any anime ever released. I’ve been a huge fan of SID ever since I first heard them doing the first ED to Brotherhood back in 2009, so I was completely on board to hear them again. It actually shocked me to realise that SID did Black Butler before ever touching Fullmetal Alchemist, so that kinda made me wish I actually picked it up back in high school. There’s just something so nostalgic and comforting about mid-to-late 2000s J-Rock that makes me get hype to watch whatever it is that’s next, even if I know full well that the next episode is gonna be abject rubbish.\\n\\nAlso, get this: you know how virtually every anime ever released ends up changing its opening halfway through the show’s run? A-1 Pictures actually made a different opening animation but they actually used the second half of Monochrome Kiss by SID for the OP which is so fucking amazing to me. There’s a lot of really amazing songs I’ve been pointed to ever since I first started watching anime, but you never really hear more than a minute and 30 seconds of the song in question. Using the second half of the same (already amazing) song still blows me away because I don’t think any other anime studio has ever done that before or even since A-1 PIctures did it.\\n\\nThe first ED track is actually an upbeat pop punk song from an AMERICAN band of all places called “I’m Alive” by BECCA. I’ve always loved animes that use foreign music for their OPs and EDs. That’s actually part of the reason why I adore shows like Wolf’s Rain and Serial Experiments Lain. What’s more is that again, there’s something really comforting and nostalgic about mid-2000s pop punk to the point where I can’t help but enjoy it. I often don’t like upbeat endings because they tend to contrast horribly with more dramatic scenes that an episode could end on, but this ED is used primarily during a time when the anime isn’t really taking itself seriously to begin with, so I really didn’t mind much in the scheme of things. Hell, the ED animation is actually just chibi segments of Sebastian doing his mundane duties as a butler. I can’t really complain, now can I?\\n\\nNow we get to the dubbing… and this is the part I’ve been dreading the most. On the Japanese side of things, we’re treated to wonderful performances by the likes of Daisuke Ono, Mayaa Sakamoto, among others. They’re a duo I’ve appreciated listening to going as far back as Wolf’s Rain, so glad to see the partnership continuing here. If you’re looking to stay sub-only, you really won’t have any complaints outside of whether or not you’ll be watching the shitty fansubs from 10 years ago. Of course, you’re probably not reading this part of the review to find out whether or not the Japanese audio is good.\\n\\nBack when Funimation still held the licenses to the entire Black Butler franchise sans the manga, they produced the dub for this show sometime in 2010. Around this time, Funimation was also working on dubbing Brotherhood since it was supposed to air on [adult swim] in the USA. I haven’t seen this sentiment echoed elsewhere, but I feel like being produced so close to Brotherhood had some degree of impact on the overall quality of the dub.\\n\\nMake no mistake: this isn’t a bad dub by any means. Well… once you get more than 3 episodes in but that’s beside the point! My biggest issue with this dub is that while Funimation opted to make sure that all of the characters who speak English use British accents, the only ones who are even remotely convincing are Brina Palencia as Ciel, J Michael Tatum as Sebastian, and  Lydia Mackay as Madame Red. The Phantomhive servants, endearing though they might be, unfortunately end up spoiling the entire bunch due to their over-exaggerated Cockney accents.\\n\\nSpeaking as someone who actually watched Hellsing Ultimate before coming over to Black Butler kind of disappoints me. I know that Ultimate was originally a Geneon show and that Funimation spent a long time gathering the original cast back together to finish the dub of that show which didn’t happen until 2014 despite licensing a good chunk of the Geneon library back in 2008. Still, was it too much to ask for Funimation to at least hire some actual British people to do some voice acting? Come on man, Victoria Harwood and Steven Brand were easily the best parts of the Hellsing Ultimate dub! My heart would leap out of my chest the moment I heard Steven Brand saying “Yes, my lord” in that wonderfully thick Scottish accent of his. Sadly, it’s a missed opportunity.\\n\\nThere’s also another point of contention I want to make: I love Chris Ayres and Patrick Seitz. They’re both wonderful voice actors and I’ve enjoyed many shows that they starred in. If there’s one thing I must say against them though, it’s that they can’t pull off a fucking Indian accent to save their lives. Speaking as a Desi man, I can’t help but cringe any time I have to listen to Prince Soma and Agni for more than a minute at a time (okay, they’re not that bad but they do get pretty fucking unbearable at times). In Funimation’s defense, I will admit that they’ve been getting better about this since they’ve been hiring more amateur talent now with all of the simuldubs they’ve been pushing out ever since 2015. Still, if Brian George was able to pull off a convincing Indian guru when voicing Guru Pathik back in 2006 for the second season of Avatar: The Last Airbender, I really don’t understand why Funimation didn’t try something similar.\\n\\nAgain, I want to reiterate that this is NOT a bad dub whatsoever and indeed, J Michael Tatum is easily the best part of the dub as Sebastian. In fact, the same cast gets back together to do the voice acting for the anime from Book of Circus-onward and the accents aren’t anywhere near as exaggerated. I can only imagine that Funimation did actually give it their best shot with what they had and they did fairly well but with plenty of noticeable rough edges. Still, any time J Michael Tatum says “Yes, my lord” while Sebastian looks at the screen smiling and kneeling before Ciel is enough to make me swoon. Take the bad with the good and you’ll find that the dub is perfectly watchable. If you get put off like I was at first, just wait until Book of Circus to listen to the dub.\\n\\nNow we come to the most subjective part of this whole review! My own personal enjoyment of this particular anime. While I do certainly still enjoy this anime on some measure, I can only really find myself enjoying particular bits taken out at random points during the show’s run. From start to finish, this show was kinda painful and even boring to get through at some points and honestly, I feel like the time you spent watching this could’ve been better spent reading the manga.\\n\\nThis isn’t something I normally say, since I used to be such a big defender of anime deviating from their source material because the 2003 Fullmetal Alchemist anime is quite literally my all-time favourite anime and that differed so wildly from the manga. The thing is though that Fullmetal Alchemist was never intended to be a 1:1 recreation of the manga. It wouldn’t have been possible at the time for Hiromu Arakwa to actually keep up with the pace of episodes being released.\\n\\nInstead, we found the 2003 anime maintaining broadly similar continuity from the manga at the very beginning while slightly changing up certain concepts (i.e. how alchemy works, the core component of a philosopher’s stone, tensions in Ishbal and Lior with the Amestrian government, etc) and then slowly expanding that as the show came closer and closer to running out of manga to work with. By the time that this does happen though, the anime’s own lore and internal logic have developed sufficiently to make sense without needing to rely so heavily on the manga anymore.\\n\\nTo be absolutely sure, the 2003 anime did actually contradict itself at some points and there are still many unanswered questions that the audience is left with considering how fast the final 5 episodes of the show are in comparison to the slow pace of the anime from Episode 28-onward. However, Bones still made an earnest attempt at trying to resolve their loose ends and they actually tried to tell a story that makes sense within the context of the universe that they created.\\n\\nA-1 Pictures really didn’t put the same level of dedication into their own gecko ending for the 2008 anime, which really is a shame. I genuinely do believe that anime studios should be able to exercise creative liberties with whatever show they’re making. However, I feel like studios need to exercise much more caution whenever they exercise those same creative liberties. From all of the failed projects that I’ve left on the backburner for years at a time, I can easily attest that it is genuinely hard to create.\\n\\nHowever, the difficulty of creation is something that shouldn’t be used to justify mediocrity. If you have the nerve to actually go out there and make something, that’s all fine and dandy but please, I beg of you, make sure that you do more than just the bare minimum necessary to wrap up your story. As the wise Hank Hill once said, “whatever you do, you should do it right, even if it’s something wrong.”\\n\\nOne of the things I’ve been struggling with for the last 5 years at this point is just how little joy I really get out of anime nowadays. I used to find myself getting engrossed in the story and characters as I was watching, formulating my own theories on whatever the subject may be, anxious to click on the “next episode” button because I didn’t know whether or not I could handle whatever would come next only to have the autoplay force the next episode in. Those were genuinely exciting times.\\n\\nUnfortunately, the only things that really seem to come out nowadays are overly ambitious shows that try so many things at once only to fail miserably. Sometimes I was indifferent like if the current talk of the community was something like Re:Zero and other times, I went in hopeful only to come out bitterly disappointed (i.e. Your Lie in April). Coming back to Black Butler for the first time in years actually did briefly bring back some of that joy I used to feel way back when, but unfortunately that joy just doesn’t stick around because of how badly it fucks up the stuff that actually matters.\\n\\nThe fact that A-1 Pictures intends for the 2008 anime to actually be the starting point for new Black Butler viewers is ultimately the worst part about all of this. As much as I adored Book of Circus/Murder/Atlantic, I would’ve preferred it if A-1 Pictures just decided to make a full-blown reboot that was actually faithful to the manga from the very beginning. Then we wouldn’t have people on Kissanime wondering where Pluto, the naked dog man went. But I digress, as I’ve gone blathering about for far too long.\\n\\nShould you watch Black Butler? Yes, but I’d like to add a LOT of asterisks to that remark. As a fan of the entire franchise, I wholeheartedly believe that you should watch Black Butler… at some point. Honestly, it would make more sense to start off at Book of Circus now because Book of Circus actually has quick flashbacks to important characters pre-Circus arc and the first episode more or less gives you the overall feel for what type of series Black Butler is. I cannot in good conscience recommend the 2008 anime if you’re looking for a good anime introduction to the Black Butler franchise as a whole. This doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t watch it, as I do firmly believe that you should definitely give it a shot since it’s not without merit whatsoever.\\n\\nStill, first impressions are important and unfortunately the 2008 anime has soured MANY people on their overall opinion of Black Butler. If you go into this anime knowing full well about its flaws and choose to ignore them for the sake of entertainment, I don’t doubt that you’ll be entertained. It’s really the matter of the show being consistently entertaining. At best, the 2008 Black Butler anime is only passable which is truly unbecoming of any tale told about the Phantomhive family. While I did enjoy it, I’m not gonna be quick to recommend it.\\n\\nAnyway, that’s all for now. Feedback is always welcome and with that, I’m out. Peace :)\\n\\n***\\n\\nThis is an updated review of Black Butler I that wrote on 26/6/2020. To put it short, my old review was painfully out of date considering how much has changed since my first review in 2014. I have it saved and I plan to publish it on my MAL blog at some point in time.\\n\\nAlso, another update that I forgot to mention in the main review itself: Funimation has long since lost the rights to a LOT of Aniplex shows that they've dubbed around 2016/2017. You can still stream some of them on Funimation's website and indeed the whole Black Butler anime series is available for you to watch there. However, they no longer produce DVDs/BDs of stuff like Fullmetal Alchemist and Black Butler. Granted, Funimation still has the rights to Book of Circus/Murder/Atlantic along with Black Butler II at the time of writing. So if you wanna pick up a decently priced DVD/BD release, get it while you still can.\\n\\nUnfortunately, this comes with the grim reminder that Aniplex of America will inevitably try to overcharge us on DVD and BD releases once Funimation loses their rights. The current offering they have for the 2008 anime is a DVD (not BD) release that comes in a posh metal box with some other nice extras, but it costs $120-something USD! If you really want a DVD/BD copy of the 2008 anime, buy a secondhand Funimation release instead. Lord only knows that they've sold enough to keep them relatively cheap.\"]}"

       "  'It\\'s games like this that make me wish Steam still had the \"Maybe recommend\" option.This game looks great and is FUN (something many games lack these days). I like the combat, Valhiem-like food and comfort systems, talent trees, base building, and I especially love that you can have armour you equip for stats and separate armour you equip for cosmetic appearance.However, after ~35 hours and being about halfway through the second zone, my desire to play more has been eroded. Like my character in game, I don\\'t have the stamina to play anymore. Below are my gripes with the game and how I\\'d like it to be improved:QUESTS AND LOREThis game is FAR TOO bloated with way too many quests and too much lore that it\\'s difficult to continue to care about.When questing, I like to plan an \"expedition\" where I try to handle a group of quests. I try take enough resources with me (healing items, food, etc) to support how long I plan to be away from my base.It is extremely difficult to tell the difference between simple \"go here\" quests and \"this is the first step in a long chain of objectives\" quests, as you\\'re only told of further objectives once you\\'ve travelled to the location of the previous objective.I would frequently find myself either running out of resource and unable to complete my planned quests, or wasting my time on a group of sundry unsatisfying quests.Vague and not always present warnings from the NPCs to \"prepare carefully\" for certain objectives are not helpful, especially with a quest log full of dozens of quests I\\'m struggling to pare down!For the lore, there\\'s way too much! Little notes, diaries, songs, poems, newspapers, NPC dialogue...! And I keep finding it all OUT OF ORDER! So much of the emotional impact is RUINED because I find the \"farewell my sweet daughter\" letter long before the \"my daughter is Sick but I have Hope\" one.I don\\'t want to read everything all jumbled and have to parse it later... I don\\'t want to wait until I\\'ve got all the entries then sit down and do my \"reading chores\" all in one go... and frankly, I don\\'t want to have to keep STOP PLAYING THE GAME to read all this! Especially when a good sixty percent of it boils down to \"World\\'s gone to ♥♥♥♥\"! I am aware the world went to ♥♥♥♥! It\\'s all anyone talks about! It is the premise of the game I chose to play!!To fix this... get rid of it! Trim down, keep what\\'s important, learn to tell the story without the bloat. Work out a way to allow the player to stay more \"on rails\" if they want to.CLASSESI played this game with my boyfriend. I pretty quickly started down the Barbarian route, and he - after some experimentation with Ranger - went Mage.I loved swinging my big weapon around, bashing up enemies, but my bf really struggled to survive. Enemies would run DIRECTLY PAST ME to get to him. I struggled to help him because I spent my stamina fighting, I didn\\'t have enough to chase enemies he was running from.I felt really pressured to start going into the Tank route to try and mitigate this, meaning I couldn\\'t play the way I wanted nor take talents I was looking forward to.How on earth could someone play any ranged class single-player? At one point in a dungeon we were beset by what felt like - no exaggeration - hundreds of enemies all at once... Without someone to tank the enemies, how could a Ranger or Mage handle that?If there are going to be multiple class options, every single one needs to be viable for singleplayer, and people playing with friends shouldn\\'t be pressured into the tank + healer + DPS setup. Everyone should be able to play how they want, not be made to longingly look at what they can\\'t have every time they level up. NPCsChrist, the NPCs are boring. In essence, they\\'re glorified crafting tables - that\\'s all they do! They don\\'t talk to each other, they don\\'t do anything but walk about (and I had to turn THAT off because they kept vanishing), and building homes for them was exactly like making a villager farm in Minecraft or a tenement block in Terraria. When they give me quests, it\\'s either for an upgrade to their crafting or for a pointless, unsatisfying quest reward I long since outleveled. Sorry you made that sword for your daughter, dude. I scrapped it. It was useless to me. This has no emotional impact on me at all.NPCs should till my fields, speed up my workstations, sweep my floors, gather wood or stone... actually act like I\\'m building a village, a new world in the ruins of the last! EXPLORATIONNgl, I got pretty sick of making my way \"as the crow flies\" towards a quest marker, only for another bloody cliff to be in the way... and when I try to find my way around, it turns out I went in the wrong direction.There should be a climbing mechanic, or a way to use the grappling hook to pull me up to more places than Ledges With The Special Grappling Hook Point.Also, the speed in which you go up/down ladders and those crosshatch grate things needs to be sped up, it\\'s really frustrating.CRAFTINGEarly game the crafting was really nice, felt like I was really making stuff! Then it became a series of workbenches that just... process stuff and I just wait. I understand the necessity of such things, and every game has such, but as the game progressed it felt like most of the crafting became \"stick it in this oven and wait for it to bake\".The cooking was excellent! I really liked sitting down by the fire and actually cooking. But then I unlocked the kettle-and-campfire which turned it into... stick it in the oven and wait for it to bake but slower than you can do yourself. I would\\'ve liked to feel like I was actually creating more.IN CONCLUSIONI enjoyed my time in this game and I\\'m sad I got tired of it. I don\\'t regret buying, and I\\'ll pencil this in for maybe playing again in a few years.',\n",

       "  \"I want to like this game but it is so ungodly unbalanced against the player it isn't even funny. Upgrading gear from tier 2 to 3 is a slog that makes you want to quit the game. Trecking through higher level areas to try and find materials only to be 1 or 2 shot by everything that breathes in that area is ridiculous. Ranged combat has no skill trees as of yet which leaves you with melee being the only thing you can actually skill up.Graphically the game is pretty good. The lighting engine has some serious issues when playing at 4k with everything maxed out.Overall mechanics seems to work fairly good. Movement and combat feel good but are a little bit clunky at times. Dark souls style combat with the parry and dodge is good except that there isn't any way to truly upgrade your stamina so in group fights you dodge 2 or 3 times and are basically screwed at that point\",\n",
       "  'Good Coop Shooter, awful SWAT game.Alright, the main issue I have with this game is extremely fixable; the suspect AI are ALL psychopathic cop killers who WANT to die. The way every suspect acts would be fine for terrorists, or like the \"Russian mobster\" guys in later levels, but it makes no sense for the majority of suspects like criminals who held up a gas station, security guards, or my favorite; random people in their own apartments. These \"suspects\" will: 1. Always be armed. (And we\\'re talking 50 round smgs first level, AKs second level) 2. Always shoot at cops. (Do you remember suspects running away in SWAT 4? Yeah no one ever runs away in this game, they just attack you until one of you dies.) They\\'ll literally bust down doors to attack officers they hear yelling. 3. Never surrender from being yelled at. (And also barely ever surrender when SHOT, like legitimately they\\'ll surrender to a beanbag gun shot, but not a real bullet.) 4. Fake surrender like 25% of the time, just to try to kill you, and throw their life away, even when they\\'re under gunpoint from your entire team. They\\'ll fake dying to gunshots too. 5. Grab hostages. 6. Shoot through walls. (The best part is when your SWAT AI shoots back through walls and kills civilians - yes, this happens.) Special shout-out to the Private Security who will spray through cover with automatic rifles upon seeing part of your leg, and thus kill their own co-workers.Every single suspect, from Terrorists, Mobsters, School-shooters, Cultists, Crack-heads, Gas Station robbers,  random people in their own homes, FBI AGENTS (Yes there is a target on a level who is a \"FISA\" agent)... they all act either exactly the same, or so similar that it really is impossible to tell the difference.This game is a great first person shooter, and I\\'ve had a lot of fun goofing around in multiplayer, but this is supposed to be a SWAT game, and the AI just takes me out of it so much, they are so over the top bloodthirsty. Again, no problem with later levels with actual terrorists and stuff like that. SWAT 4 ends with you fighting armored, machine gun toting terrorists as well, (Ironically I think they\\'re still less insane than regular Ready Or Not suspects) but it starts with pretty simple levels, with suspects who act more or less how they should. Level 2 in this game tells you that you\\'re going to stop a hostage situation with ONE PERSON. Instead you fight 11 petty criminals, who, in their own apartments, with no fore-warning from the police, just walk around armed, and decide that they all want to die today.The ridiculous part about this is that I remember the suspects actually being much more reasonable when the game first launched on steam.I could make a whole other review going over other issues like bugs (TONS OF BUGS), the AI being stupid, the game not being particularly stable, matchmaking not working well, mod.io being awful, optimization being really bad, the briefings lying, the lack of info the game gives players, bad development decisions - like remaking the same levels over and over, the recent update being a massive letdown, removing a bunch of variants for levels, removing weapons (that are still referenced in the game btw)... I wanted to focus on a more foundational issue with the game\\'s design. All of these things can be changed, and If they would just fix the insane AI, I would recommend this game. If this was say... Ground Branch, the AI would be acceptable, good even, if you ignore the bugs... but this is supposed to be a SWAT game.I notice in other reviews people saying that everyone just needs to \"git gud\". I want to be clear, this is not a difficulty thing. I\\'ve S ranked all of the levels, and completing all of the levels isn\\'t hard. The AI is just so far removed from natural behavior that it completely ruins all immersion. OH AND THE DLC IS A LIE. \"\"SERVARE VITAS\" - Conduct operations under the banner of the United States\\' most elite tactical unit, the FBI\\'s Hostage Rescue Team, with this unique DLC. \" I have to add this in here, because I feel that it\\'s relevant to the scummy-ness of the devs, and because I only just became aware of it; After the newest update, they removed the \"supporter edition\" from steam, no warning as far as I know. and now EIGHT of the TWELVE bullet points from the DLC are either a direct lie, or haven\\'t released yet. All of the outfits and the shield got changed to remove the FBI and HRT writing, the rifle is named differently, the gas-mask got changed for no reason, we\\'re still missing the coyote camo uniform, the supporter test branch hasn\\'t been used in many months (which honestly I like, but still it was promised) *The Soundtrack finally came out 7 months after they promised. Ok so they announced the DLC bundled with the supporter Edition - it\\'s a few cosmetics, and 3 maps, anyone can play the maps if you just join a host with the DLC, definitely not what I expected. People were making hype about other countries\\' SWAT teams and stuff, and this is really not living up to the price. I may have my problems with the game.. but learning about the supporter edition being changed made my blood boil. You officially launch the game and make zero mention about how you just screwed over people who payed you 80 EXTRA DOLLARS.If you want to just go massacre people in Coop this game can be fun with randoms... sometimes. It can also be extremely frustating - people dying constantly, not even trying to work together, killing everyone. 1 in 1,000 matches you\\'ll actually get a decent team that can properly go non-lethal, and those are the best experiences.If you want a good singleplayer SWAT game, this is not it. My recommendation would be to go get SWAT 4 on GOG (It\\'s not on steam) and honestly also get the SWAT: Elite Force mod, it\\'s just adds more content and fixes some bugs.',\n",

       "  'I enjoyed this game for a little while, but now that I\\'ve reached the midgame (third of five islands), I find there isn\\'t much to keep me interested. At its core, the gameplay boils down to catching fish so you can catch fish faster, while finding upgrades to catch other fish faster. What I hoped for from this game was a sense of uncovering the unknown, that Lovecraftian feeling of being incapable of comprehending the true shape of the world, and I just don\\'t experience that at all in Dredge.Here\\'s an example: When you find your first Aberrant fish, all mutated and unearthly and so on, you bring it to the fishmonger and he says (paraphrased, of course) \"Ah yeah these show up sometimes I\\'ll give you extra money for these\".The horrors of the unknown are less \\'lurking in the deep\\' than they are \\'lurking in the fish aisle at Walmart\\'. All the inhabitants of the game world are already used to the horrors of the unknown, and readily acknowledge that they\\'re there. \"Ah yeah the burrowing nightmare fish took me family crest, can you go get it?\" \"Ah yeah I made an electrical thingy that makes the unknowable tentacled beast from the abyssal deeps go away, can you go plug it in?\" There\\'s a cult of guys that make you do fetch quests to bring them mackerel.I can\\'t say that the fishing gameplay makes it worthwhile, either. Whether fishing or dredging, you\\'re going to be doing one of four fairly similar rhythm games that get old quite fast. You get a few special abilities, but they just make it a bit easier to avoid the dangers you\\'ve already learned to avoid by that point.I will say this, though: The art is phenomenal, and the gameplay is actually quite relaxing. If you\\'re looking for a chill game, maybe put on a podcast and fish, you might get something out of it. Otherwise, I cannot recommend Dredge at the current price point.',\n",

A nice easy game where you can just just sit back to enjoy the scenery, and deliver some cargo, or maybe it's because I just graduated from college, I'm a total failure, my life is in shambles, and the feeling of delivering a tank of ethanol to a gas station 600 miles away for a hefty payoff gives me an escape from the reality that I'll never amount to anything.8/10.

       "  'Over 1400 hours in Steam, and much much more over the launcher later, I have come to the conclusion:This game will entirely, and fully, change you as a person. It will destroy your mental stability, force your money out of your wallet while you\\'re still fresh, and then keep you playing as a sunken cost fallacy. The fun factor is very limiting, especially with the last updates, which add new stuff, yet make it nearly unreachable for players who don\\'t actively invest hundreds of dollars into the game. This is, as far as I know, the only game which ACTIVELY PUNISHES you for playing it. Even in battles with a K/D over 1 you will most likely lose SL if you are playing on high tier ... unless you buy a ridiculously overpriced vehicle or premium account. Even with those bonuses, the grind is extremely long. After literal years, I managed to grind only ONE tech tree, and not even in its entirety. Only to see my setups destroyed by BR changes.The economy is the worse of the worst. Vehicles are overpriced and take long to research, and then for some reason you have to research and buy modules that are already installed on your tank. You cant even properly repair or put out (more than one) fires without the modules. And everything takes long to grind and will empty your SL pool. But don\\'t worry, you can always buy it for gold and waste your hard-earned real money on something that would give you a barely playable vehicle.The balance of the game is also very bad. Sealclubbers in low tier, hackers in high tier. Vehicles with thermals fighting vehicles from the 40s-50s. People shootng through houses and hills. CAS with guided munitions team-wiping all allies. If you play CAS, you get pilot sniped from 20km. You respawn in a tank and die to a UAV. You spawn in a UAV, fly for 15 minutes to the battle, then die to AA. You get sent to hangar after a gruelling battle to see that you lost 12k SL as a result. And then you grind your teeth and push that \"To Battle\" button yet again, hoping for it to be different. It won\\'t be.Every good aspect of this game is covered up in its entirety by the bad ones. For every pro, there are 10 cons. All the graphics are good for is to see your plane/tank gracefully explode after yet another unfair death. Sometimes they have sales too, which allows you to buy vehicles not at \"ridiculously overpriced\" price but at \"highly overpriced\" price. Wonderful news for you, little Timmy, go get your mother\\'s credit card. You\\'ll get good if you buy this vehicle. Or the next. Or the next.Someday you will deinstall the game. And then you realized that it was for nothing. You wasted time and money on it, and you aren\\'t getting it back. All you can do is weep and try to move on, only for your addiction to return after a month or two, as you sigh, feed the snail your last 20 bucks for premium time, and begin the cycle again.If you are new, you\\'re free to have some fun. But if you don\\'t stop soon, you will not be able to later. If you\\'re an experienced player with a long playtime, I\\'m sorry. The snail giveth, the snail taketh away.',\n",

There are multiple big maps to enjoy and the scenery is some of the best I've ever seen. There is so much to see and explore but if every game comes it's flaws. If you are impatient with a short attention span, this game is definitely not for you. There can be long periods of times before you even see and animal and to maximise your success, you have to be slow as to not make any noise. After playing a while, you start to feel you have no end goal, but this is where the hunting lodge DLCs come in. They allow you to put animals you've hunted on display. There is no worse feeling than hunting your first albino deer and not being able to keep it. There is barely any lore except for a few story missions. After downloading the game, you get access to two different maps. If you want to access any others, you have to buy the DLCs or join someone through multiplayer, if the host leaves, you will be kicked after 15 minutes. Different maps have different animals to hunt which adds much needed variety to the game. This game is meant for solitary gameplay, even if it has access to a multiplayer. At the end of the day, i would only recommend this game if you are patient and looking for a chill, relaxed solo experience.\",\n",
       "  \"A truly sad experience. This release crushes all fond childhood memories of playing Civ and totally misses the mark on what it should feel like to play the series.I really tried to like Civ VII, but I can't. The disrespect for players and fans alike is palpable with a release like this. The biggest money grab I have ever experienced, and bald-faced too: release a game that's clearly not in a good state, charge an insane price for it (people will buy it anyways, right) AND release the first DLC less than a month later. In retrospect, maybe we should have seen it coming.Instead of echoing all the other reviews that go into detail of what's wrong and what would be a path forward to start fixing some of the broken trust, I'll just say this: don't buy this game in its current state, and wait for a sale if you really want to play Civ VII.

BeamNG.drive tries to be the most accurate vehicle damaging simulator, and it is succeeding.

The game itself is two steps ahead other games in terms of realistic vehicle simulation and its soft-body physics, so thanks to this it's unique. Driving cars is easy, just press W, but controlling them is a whole different story. Disabling automatic clutch, gearbox safety and playing on a manual gearbox using a steering wheel makes the game a lot harder to play, but that's the fun here. Tuning cars, especially with mods, is really fun and rewarding once you master it. I've never seen a game with this much car tuning capabilites, so that makes it stand out among others. Mods make the gameplay 10x better, as there are infinite possibilities to play the game. For now, there are only short scenarios and freeroam, that can get boring after some time, but a career mode is in the making since the game is in early access. The game in its current state is really fun as-is, and it will continue to expand in the future. The devs are updating and hotfixing the game frequently, so that is a big plus. Also, I hope BeamNG will get optimised more and more, because rendering and calculating physics is really CPU intensive, so playing with more than 1-2 cars will drop your framerate, especially on big maps, like West Coast USA. Overall, if you like cars you need to play this game, it's really fun once you get into it.\",\n",

It already looks and feels much better to start with- and since the \"other game\" seemingly recieves a small content-devoid update every year or so, this game will EASILY overpass it if not already.

       "  '2024 Update:The Final Shape is really good. Still wouldn\\'t recommend any new players to try this game though.Old Review:Ah, Destiny. I love so much about this franchise. The gameplay, shooting, jumping, throwing lots of grenades, dismantling guns.. Destiny is a franchise I\\'ve spent a lot of time in. I\\'ve accomplished some of the hardest achievements in the game. Low man raid encounters, solo flawless dungeon completions, Conquerer seals, etc. My honest opinion on this game is that it\\'s the best PvE FPS experience out there, ruined in multiple ways by problems that honestly shouldn\\'t be hard to fix or at least shouldn\\'t have been a problem for this long. I\\'ll start with the good:- Top tier gunplay and class feel- The in game movement is an underrated part of the experience in my opinion, each class has it\\'s own traversal tech if you really want to git gud- The raids and dungeons oh my god, they\\'re so awesome. Almost worth the time to invest into alone- Some of the coolest moments in the history of online gaming have happened in Destiny (just look up the Whisper mission)- The seasonal stories over the past year and current campaign as of writing this (Witch Queen) have great storytelling- Guns. So many guns. Almost a gun for every situation. Most of us in the community have actual real nostalgia for the muscle memory of some of our guns that we can\\'t use anymore. - Tons of content to check out for a new player- Regular weekly updates from the dev team on Thursdays (TWAB = This Week At Bungie)- On top of that, the dev team is pretty active on Twitter when the more unhinged members of the player base aren\\'t sending them death threats- The soundtrack is incredible- This is gonna sound like a meme but for real, the enemy AI in this game is pretty incredible. It can bug out sometimes of course but especially in harder content, different enemy types approach you different ways based on the weapons you use or the places you stand.- If you like the Diablo experience of just mowing down packs of enemies, D2 can fill that spot in your heartNow for the cons:- We\\'re all addicted. You\\'ll see this whole \"lol 5k hours I don\\'t recommend but I\\'ll log back in tomorrow\" jokes and honestly, there\\'s some truth to that. It\\'s a grindy MMO game. Some elements of it are designed to keep you playing.- All the classics are here: weekly drip-feeding of new content, bad communication on certain long-standing issues in the game for months and even years at a time, and a general level of jank and bugginess to the game that doesn\\'t really ever go away.- Certain parts of the game are massively undeveloped, but forced into the same grinds every season. Crucible, the main PVP mode in this game, only just got it\\'s first new map this season (4 weeks ago at the time of writing) in over 3 years.- Gambit, another main playlist, has been reworked like 4 times(?) since it came out and has somehow gotten worse each time. Also hasn\\'t had a new map since it came out, and has in fact actually lost content since it\\'s release.- The whole game runs on peer to peer servers. This isn\\'t super noticeable for the majority of content in the game, as most of the content in Destiny 2 is team based PvE content or story missions etc, but this makes the PvP just generally unplayable to a lot of people who try it. Crucible can be very fun but there\\'s always a layer of \"oh wow I just headshot that guy with my reticle at least half of my screen away from him\"- The cosmetic shop in Destiny 2, the eververse, is not one of the worst systems I\\'ve ever seen but it\\'s not super great either. It\\'s a pretty classic case of all of the best looking armor sets in the game, and virtually ALL weapon ornaments (weapon cosmetics in regular terms) being locked behind either a real money purchase or PRAYING it goes on sale for a currency you can earn weekly in game. Some cosmetics in the eververse haven\\'t been available for bright dust in years.- Sunsetting, a big process that happened about 2 years ago, removed a ton of content from the game that most of us paid real money for. Entire expansion areas, weapons, quests, etc. were \"vaulted\"- Bungie has a history of taking a really long time to fix more wide, sweeping issues with the game- Bungie\\'s current season system has a few good elements to it, but overall the way they\\'ve designed seasons has become pretty stale over the past 2 years or so- Bugs, man. Destiny 2 is always a buggy game, more than most in my experience. Most of us learn to live with the general jank, but it can be really frustrating sometimes. This season (Season of the Haunted) has been even worse than usual.- The main 3 playlists, Vanguard Ops (short PvE missions such as strikes and battlegrounds), Crucible, and Gambit, are roughly 40% or maybe more of your playtime each season, yet they haven\\'t updated them in any meaningful way in at least 3 years. - The pricing of this game. Realistically, D2 should\\'ve never been pushed as a free to play game. If you wanna access, and I\\'m not exaggerating, 95% of this game, you have to buy the expansions anyway. There\\'s no \"previous expansions\" bundle at a reduced price, and nowadays there\\'s even stuff like the 30th anniversary pack that gives you a dungeon and a rocket launcher for 30 bucks. It\\'s hard to get new players into this game when you have to open with \"well I know it says free to play but if you wanna realistically do the endgame content in this game (Trials/GM Nightfalls) you\\'ll have to spend like 200 dollars for all the expansions\"- The UI is kinda slow and bad. There\\'s a decent amount of item bloat so if you\\'re like me and hate having like 10 new flashing items in your inventory, you\\'re gonna spend a lot of time holding your F key to dismantle thingsDestiny 2 is a game that is super great at it\\'s core, but tends to shoot itself in the foot a lot of the time. It\\'s a conflicted game, with most of the dev time in seasonal content seemingly going towards releasing new things and rarely improving the content we spend the majority of our time grinding. It\\'s also a game that\\'s going through a big transition period right now. Currently Bungie has made it pretty clear that they\\'re developing D2 for the long term right now, so some things are just being pushed to the side for the overall health of the future of the game. I don\\'t know how much I believe that, but if you\\'re reading this and you know what I mean when I say Path of Exile 2, I salute you. One thing I haven\\'t really mentioned so far is that realistically, the best content in this game really requires a group of friends to enjoy at it\\'s fullest. I\\'ve been lucky enough to make some real long-term friends in my clan, and legitimately spend a lot of my time teaching new players how to do raids/dungeons/GMs. If you\\'re a solo player, many activities are either straight up impossble (raids) or they require significant time investment to complete solo (dungeons, GM nightfalls, etc). It\\'s a game all about building your vault of items so you have something for every situation. New weapon roll for this build, crazy armor roll with great stats, etc. This can take a long time and kind of creates this weird situation for newer players where they can just go months without getting a certain exotic weapon they need. To cut things short, I love this game and have obviously spent a lot of time with it. I can\\'t currently recommend it to newer players unfortunately. If you\\'re returning, maybe. The Witch Queen campaign on Legendary difficulty is some of the most fun I\\'ve had with my friends in this game in years, and the seasonal stories really do get better and better. If you have friends and the disposable income, give the game a shot. If you want the game to respect your time, look elsewhere.',\n",

       " \"Minecraft 2025 is a colossal misfire that makes you wonder how anyone could fumble a property as endlessly creative as Minecraft this badly especially when Super Mario proved video game adaptations can be vibrant, fun, and worth watching. Instead of a blocky wonderland bursting with imagination, we get a soulless, corporate cash-grab that's as uninspired as a dirt hut built by a first-day player. And at the center of this mess is Jack Black, whose over-the-top shtick as Steve feels less like a character and more like a bloated, annoying caricature of himself phoning it in with the energy **** who ate too many pork chops and forgot what made his Bowser a good character.Where Super Mario delivered a tight, colorful romp with a villain you couldn't help but like to hate, Minecraft stumbles through a plot so thin it could've been scribbled on a 3x5 card with a fat sharpie. The live action gimmick is a disaster with corpulent Jack Black waddling around in a turquoise shirt against a green screen looks less like an adventure and more like a sad clown act at a kid's party no one showed up to. His constant mugging and forced musical numbers grate on the nerves, turning Steve into a flabby, loud distraction instead of the everyman hero Minecraft fans **** visuals? A garish mishmash of CGI and real world actors that clash worse than a creeper in a flower biome. The charm of Minecraft's pixelated freedom is buried under a generic 'save the world' story that feels like it was ripped from a dozen better films none of which bothered to star a Jack Black who seems to think yelling and flailing is a substitute for depth. Super Mario knew how to balance nostalgia with heart; this just shovels Easter eggs and tired gags into a pit and calls it a day. It's not just terrible it's a betrayal of everything that makes Minecraft special, leaving you longing for the Mushroom Kingdom instead of this blockheaded bore.TLDR - Jack Black ruined this movie and he is a bloated slob who phoned it in.\"]"

       " 'original_text': ['Gotta be honest, I find this game really boring. The only improvements are the amount of customization options and different skintones (because animal crossing was way behind in that aspect). Other than that, this is a step down from New Leaf. The terraforming, which was the most advertised feature, takes forever to get to. New Leaf lets you jump into the fun immediately, but here you have to wait soo long until the interesting part. I actually didn\\'t get to the terraforming because I put the game down a year ago and haven\\'t checked on it since. I\\'ve never lost interest in a game so quickly. Another thing that bothers me is how washed down and boring the villagers (or islanders) are now. I know there were people who didn\\'t like how some villagers were mean or sassy in older games, but you can\\'t deny that it added spice and made them feel like real neighbors (because not everybody will instantly love you upon first meeting in real life, obviously). But now all the villagers have the same cookie-cutter niceness, making them lose what made them distict. Even villagers with snooty and grouchy personality types lack the edge they used to have. New Horizons was only critically acclaimed because it released during the pandemic when everyone was dying of boredom. If it was released before or a year after the pandemic, I\\'d imagine people would\\'ve been much more critical of it. I think they tried too hard to be \"cozy\" and \"chill\" that it backfired and made the game boring and bland.',\n",

And Rust honestly delivered in building that tense, insecure atmosphere in my first couple of hours. You start naked, with a piece of rock. You mine ores, destroy trees, build your first weapon and just try to survive. Any animal, any player is your potential murderer and players won’t hesitate to murder you and loot all your things.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe more I played though, the more I observed how this is not a game “for me”. Even when you are offline, your base can be raided and everything you have can be stolen. The community is beyond toxic, but that’s kind of expected for this sort of game. Servers usually reset weekly, biweekly or monthly, preventing many players from everlasting slavery and giving everyone a chance to start on equal terms. But that comes with a caveat: All the benefits you earned by your grinding will be lost no matter what.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlso, it should be mentioned that Rust offers some “lite” pay-to-win items. You can purchase things which appear to be only cosmetic, but do actually provide some gameplay advantages.\\r\\n\\r\\nRust is a good game for people with a very specific taste in games. It achieves what it’s going for, but ultimately is not a game most people would be willing to invest their time in, including myself. If you are a solo player, stay away from Rust. If you have limited time to invest in one game, stay away from Rust. If a mature community is important for you, stay away from Rust.

This can make it difficult for newcomers to understand combat mechanics, character builds, and exploration **** challenging enemies and punishing boss fights further add to the difficulty, requiring precise timing and strategy. Without a guided learning curve, many new players might find themselves frustrated by repeated failures. Additionally, the game’s intricate leveling system and vague item descriptions can confuse those unfamiliar with FromSoftware’s style.While the sense of discovery and accomplishment is rewarding, Elden Ring might feel unforgiving for beginners, making it a tough entry point into the Soulsborne genre.',\n",
       "  \"So far biggest disappointment of the year for me. Lvl 15 titan and that's it, no more interest to play the game anymore. Boring as hell, story is bad, missions are very repetitive, looting is weak, PvP is terrible and overall lack of content. Graphics are great and so is the music, but that alone doesn't make the game good.\\r\\n\\r\\nJack of all trades, master of none.\",\n",
       "  'I played Tekken 1, 2 and 3 in my childhood.\\nI skipped the PS3 and came back on the PS4 and purchased tekken 7\\nI was hyped and worried about that Tekken 7 could be the last, because there were no signs for a next game. And then when the data leak came out I was also hyped for tekken 8. but since I purchased that game on my PS5 my fun on that game get lower and lower.\\n\\nThat game was designed for micro transactions.\\n \\nin tekken 7 I could get all designs all costumes with playing that game. But now in tekken 8 they costumes for the ingame currency are just crap and everything else even the old character costumes are only available with micro transactions.\\n\\n\\nI was worried about that tekken 7 would be the last. Now I hope tekken 8 is the last one.',\n",

       "  'It\\'s games like this that make me wish Steam still had the \"Maybe recommend\" option.This game looks great and is FUN (something many games lack these days). I like the combat, Valhiem-like food and comfort systems, talent trees, base building, and I especially love that you can have armour you equip for stats and separate armour you equip for cosmetic appearance.However, after ~35 hours and being about halfway through the second zone, my desire to play more has been eroded. Like my character in game, I don\\'t have the stamina to play anymore. Below are my gripes with the game and how I\\'d like it to be improved:QUESTS AND LOREThis game is FAR TOO bloated with way too many quests and too much lore that it\\'s difficult to continue to care about.When questing, I like to plan an \"expedition\" where I try to handle a group of quests. I try take enough resources with me (healing items, food, etc) to support how long I plan to be away from my base.It is extremely difficult to tell the difference between simple \"go here\" quests and \"this is the first step in a long chain of objectives\" quests, as you\\'re only told of further objectives once you\\'ve travelled to the location of the previous objective.I would frequently find myself either running out of resource and unable to complete my planned quests, or wasting my time on a group of sundry unsatisfying quests.Vague and not always present warnings from the NPCs to \"prepare carefully\" for certain objectives are not helpful, especially with a quest log full of dozens of quests I\\'m struggling to pare down!For the lore, there\\'s way too much! Little notes, diaries, songs, poems, newspapers, NPC dialogue...! And I keep finding it all OUT OF ORDER! So much of the emotional impact is RUINED because I find the \"farewell my sweet daughter\" letter long before the \"my daughter is Sick but I have Hope\" one.I don\\'t want to read everything all jumbled and have to parse it later... I don\\'t want to wait until I\\'ve got all the entries then sit down and do my \"reading chores\" all in one go... and frankly, I don\\'t want to have to keep STOP PLAYING THE GAME to read all this! Especially when a good sixty percent of it boils down to \"World\\'s gone to ♥♥♥♥\"! I am aware the world went to ♥♥♥♥! It\\'s all anyone talks about! It is the premise of the game I chose to play!!To fix this... get rid of it! Trim down, keep what\\'s important, learn to tell the story without the bloat. Work out a way to allow the player to stay more \"on rails\" if they want to.CLASSESI played this game with my boyfriend. I pretty quickly started down the Barbarian route, and he - after some experimentation with Ranger - went Mage.I loved swinging my big weapon around, bashing up enemies, but my bf really struggled to survive. Enemies would run DIRECTLY PAST ME to get to him. I struggled to help him because I spent my stamina fighting, I didn\\'t have enough to chase enemies he was running from.I felt really pressured to start going into the Tank route to try and mitigate this, meaning I couldn\\'t play the way I wanted nor take talents I was looking forward to.How on earth could someone play any ranged class single-player? At one point in a dungeon we were beset by what felt like - no exaggeration - hundreds of enemies all at once... Without someone to tank the enemies, how could a Ranger or Mage handle that?If there are going to be multiple class options, every single one needs to be viable for singleplayer, and people playing with friends shouldn\\'t be pressured into the tank + healer + DPS setup. Everyone should be able to play how they want, not be made to longingly look at what they can\\'t have every time they level up. NPCsChrist, the NPCs are boring. In essence, they\\'re glorified crafting tables - that\\'s all they do! They don\\'t talk to each other, they don\\'t do anything but walk about (and I had to turn THAT off because they kept vanishing), and building homes for them was exactly like making a villager farm in Minecraft or a tenement block in Terraria. When they give me quests, it\\'s either for an upgrade to their crafting or for a pointless, unsatisfying quest reward I long since outleveled. Sorry you made that sword for your daughter, dude. I scrapped it. It was useless to me. This has no emotional impact on me at all.NPCs should till my fields, speed up my workstations, sweep my floors, gather wood or stone... actually act like I\\'m building a village, a new world in the ruins of the last! EXPLORATIONNgl, I got pretty sick of making my way \"as the crow flies\" towards a quest marker, only for another bloody cliff to be in the way... and when I try to find my way around, it turns out I went in the wrong direction.There should be a climbing mechanic, or a way to use the grappling hook to pull me up to more places than Ledges With The Special Grappling Hook Point.Also, the speed in which you go up/down ladders and those crosshatch grate things needs to be sped up, it\\'s really frustrating.CRAFTINGEarly game the crafting was really nice, felt like I was really making stuff! Then it became a series of workbenches that just... process stuff and I just wait. I understand the necessity of such things, and every game has such, but as the game progressed it felt like most of the crafting became \"stick it in this oven and wait for it to bake\".The cooking was excellent! I really liked sitting down by the fire and actually cooking. But then I unlocked the kettle-and-campfire which turned it into... stick it in the oven and wait for it to bake but slower than you can do yourself. I would\\'ve liked to feel like I was actually creating more.IN CONCLUSIONI enjoyed my time in this game and I\\'m sad I got tired of it. I don\\'t regret buying, and I\\'ll pencil this in for maybe playing again in a few years.',\n",

       "  \"I want to like this game but it is so ungodly unbalanced against the player it isn't even funny. Upgrading gear from tier 2 to 3 is a slog that makes you want to quit the game. Trecking through higher level areas to try and find materials only to be 1 or 2 shot by everything that breathes in that area is ridiculous. Ranged combat has no skill trees as of yet which leaves you with melee being the only thing you can actually skill up.Graphically the game is pretty good. The lighting engine has some serious issues when playing at 4k with everything maxed out.Overall mechanics seems to work fairly good. Movement and combat feel good but are a little bit clunky at times. Dark souls style combat with the parry and dodge is good except that there isn't any way to truly upgrade your stamina so in group fights you dodge 2 or 3 times and are basically screwed at that point\",\n",
       "  'Good Coop Shooter, awful SWAT game.Alright, the main issue I have with this game is extremely fixable; the suspect AI are ALL psychopathic cop killers who WANT to die. The way every suspect acts would be fine for terrorists, or like the \"Russian mobster\" guys in later levels, but it makes no sense for the majority of suspects like criminals who held up a gas station, security guards, or my favorite; random people in their own apartments. These \"suspects\" will: 1. Always be armed. (And we\\'re talking 50 round smgs first level, AKs second level) 2. Always shoot at cops. (Do you remember suspects running away in SWAT 4? Yeah no one ever runs away in this game, they just attack you until one of you dies.) They\\'ll literally bust down doors to attack officers they hear yelling. 3. Never surrender from being yelled at. (And also barely ever surrender when SHOT, like legitimately they\\'ll surrender to a beanbag gun shot, but not a real bullet.) 4. Fake surrender like 25% of the time, just to try to kill you, and throw their life away, even when they\\'re under gunpoint from your entire team. They\\'ll fake dying to gunshots too. 5. Grab hostages. 6. Shoot through walls. (The best part is when your SWAT AI shoots back through walls and kills civilians - yes, this happens.) Special shout-out to the Private Security who will spray through cover with automatic rifles upon seeing part of your leg, and thus kill their own co-workers.Every single suspect, from Terrorists, Mobsters, School-shooters, Cultists, Crack-heads, Gas Station robbers,  random people in their own homes, FBI AGENTS (Yes there is a target on a level who is a \"FISA\" agent)... they all act either exactly the same, or so similar that it really is impossible to tell the difference.This game is a great first person shooter, and I\\'ve had a lot of fun goofing around in multiplayer, but this is supposed to be a SWAT game, and the AI just takes me out of it so much, they are so over the top bloodthirsty. Again, no problem with later levels with actual terrorists and stuff like that. SWAT 4 ends with you fighting armored, machine gun toting terrorists as well, (Ironically I think they\\'re still less insane than regular Ready Or Not suspects) but it starts with pretty simple levels, with suspects who act more or less how they should. Level 2 in this game tells you that you\\'re going to stop a hostage situation with ONE PERSON. Instead you fight 11 petty criminals, who, in their own apartments, with no fore-warning from the police, just walk around armed, and decide that they all want to die today.The ridiculous part about this is that I remember the suspects actually being much more reasonable when the game first launched on steam.I could make a whole other review going over other issues like bugs (TONS OF BUGS), the AI being stupid, the game not being particularly stable, matchmaking not working well, mod.io being awful, optimization being really bad, the briefings lying, the lack of info the game gives players, bad development decisions - like remaking the same levels over and over, the recent update being a massive letdown, removing a bunch of variants for levels, removing weapons (that are still referenced in the game btw)... I wanted to focus on a more foundational issue with the game\\'s design. All of these things can be changed, and If they would just fix the insane AI, I would recommend this game. If this was say... Ground Branch, the AI would be acceptable, good even, if you ignore the bugs... but this is supposed to be a SWAT game.I notice in other reviews people saying that everyone just needs to \"git gud\". I want to be clear, this is not a difficulty thing. I\\'ve S ranked all of the levels, and completing all of the levels isn\\'t hard. The AI is just so far removed from natural behavior that it completely ruins all immersion. OH AND THE DLC IS A LIE. \"\"SERVARE VITAS\" - Conduct operations under the banner of the United States\\' most elite tactical unit, the FBI\\'s Hostage Rescue Team, with this unique DLC. \" I have to add this in here, because I feel that it\\'s relevant to the scummy-ness of the devs, and because I only just became aware of it; After the newest update, they removed the \"supporter edition\" from steam, no warning as far as I know. and now EIGHT of the TWELVE bullet points from the DLC are either a direct lie, or haven\\'t released yet. All of the outfits and the shield got changed to remove the FBI and HRT writing, the rifle is named differently, the gas-mask got changed for no reason, we\\'re still missing the coyote camo uniform, the supporter test branch hasn\\'t been used in many months (which honestly I like, but still it was promised) *The Soundtrack finally came out 7 months after they promised. Ok so they announced the DLC bundled with the supporter Edition - it\\'s a few cosmetics, and 3 maps, anyone can play the maps if you just join a host with the DLC, definitely not what I expected. People were making hype about other countries\\' SWAT teams and stuff, and this is really not living up to the price. I may have my problems with the game.. but learning about the supporter edition being changed made my blood boil. You officially launch the game and make zero mention about how you just screwed over people who payed you 80 EXTRA DOLLARS.If you want to just go massacre people in Coop this game can be fun with randoms... sometimes. It can also be extremely frustating - people dying constantly, not even trying to work together, killing everyone. 1 in 1,000 matches you\\'ll actually get a decent team that can properly go non-lethal, and those are the best experiences.If you want a good singleplayer SWAT game, this is not it. My recommendation would be to go get SWAT 4 on GOG (It\\'s not on steam) and honestly also get the SWAT: Elite Force mod, it\\'s just adds more content and fixes some bugs.',\n",

       "  'I enjoyed this game for a little while, but now that I\\'ve reached the midgame (third of five islands), I find there isn\\'t much to keep me interested. At its core, the gameplay boils down to catching fish so you can catch fish faster, while finding upgrades to catch other fish faster. What I hoped for from this game was a sense of uncovering the unknown, that Lovecraftian feeling of being incapable of comprehending the true shape of the world, and I just don\\'t experience that at all in Dredge.Here\\'s an example: When you find your first Aberrant fish, all mutated and unearthly and so on, you bring it to the fishmonger and he says (paraphrased, of course) \"Ah yeah these show up sometimes I\\'ll give you extra money for these\".The horrors of the unknown are less \\'lurking in the deep\\' than they are \\'lurking in the fish aisle at Walmart\\'. All the inhabitants of the game world are already used to the horrors of the unknown, and readily acknowledge that they\\'re there. \"Ah yeah the burrowing nightmare fish took me family crest, can you go get it?\" \"Ah yeah I made an electrical thingy that makes the unknowable tentacled beast from the abyssal deeps go away, can you go plug it in?\" There\\'s a cult of guys that make you do fetch quests to bring them mackerel.I can\\'t say that the fishing gameplay makes it worthwhile, either. Whether fishing or dredging, you\\'re going to be doing one of four fairly similar rhythm games that get old quite fast. You get a few special abilities, but they just make it a bit easier to avoid the dangers you\\'ve already learned to avoid by that point.I will say this, though: The art is phenomenal, and the gameplay is actually quite relaxing. If you\\'re looking for a chill game, maybe put on a podcast and fish, you might get something out of it. Otherwise, I cannot recommend Dredge at the current price point.',\n",

       "  'Over 1400 hours in Steam, and much much more over the launcher later, I have come to the conclusion:This game will entirely, and fully, change you as a person. It will destroy your mental stability, force your money out of your wallet while you\\'re still fresh, and then keep you playing as a sunken cost fallacy. The fun factor is very limiting, especially with the last updates, which add new stuff, yet make it nearly unreachable for players who don\\'t actively invest hundreds of dollars into the game. This is, as far as I know, the only game which ACTIVELY PUNISHES you for playing it. Even in battles with a K/D over 1 you will most likely lose SL if you are playing on high tier ... unless you buy a ridiculously overpriced vehicle or premium account. Even with those bonuses, the grind is extremely long. After literal years, I managed to grind only ONE tech tree, and not even in its entirety. Only to see my setups destroyed by BR changes.The economy is the worse of the worst. Vehicles are overpriced and take long to research, and then for some reason you have to research and buy modules that are already installed on your tank. You cant even properly repair or put out (more than one) fires without the modules. And everything takes long to grind and will empty your SL pool. But don\\'t worry, you can always buy it for gold and waste your hard-earned real money on something that would give you a barely playable vehicle.The balance of the game is also very bad. Sealclubbers in low tier, hackers in high tier. Vehicles with thermals fighting vehicles from the 40s-50s. People shootng through houses and hills. CAS with guided munitions team-wiping all allies. If you play CAS, you get pilot sniped from 20km. You respawn in a tank and die to a UAV. You spawn in a UAV, fly for 15 minutes to the battle, then die to AA. You get sent to hangar after a gruelling battle to see that you lost 12k SL as a result. And then you grind your teeth and push that \"To Battle\" button yet again, hoping for it to be different. It won\\'t be.Every good aspect of this game is covered up in its entirety by the bad ones. For every pro, there are 10 cons. All the graphics are good for is to see your plane/tank gracefully explode after yet another unfair death. Sometimes they have sales too, which allows you to buy vehicles not at \"ridiculously overpriced\" price but at \"highly overpriced\" price. Wonderful news for you, little Timmy, go get your mother\\'s credit card. You\\'ll get good if you buy this vehicle. Or the next. Or the next.Someday you will deinstall the game. And then you realized that it was for nothing. You wasted time and money on it, and you aren\\'t getting it back. All you can do is weep and try to move on, only for your addiction to return after a month or two, as you sigh, feed the snail your last 20 bucks for premium time, and begin the cycle again.If you are new, you\\'re free to have some fun. But if you don\\'t stop soon, you will not be able to later. If you\\'re an experienced player with a long playtime, I\\'m sorry. The snail giveth, the snail taketh away.',\n",

There are multiple big maps to enjoy and the scenery is some of the best I've ever seen. There is so much to see and explore but if every game comes it's flaws. If you are impatient with a short attention span, this game is definitely not for you. There can be long periods of times before you even see and animal and to maximise your success, you have to be slow as to not make any noise. After playing a while, you start to feel you have no end goal, but this is where the hunting lodge DLCs come in. They allow you to put animals you've hunted on display. There is no worse feeling than hunting your first albino deer and not being able to keep it. There is barely any lore except for a few story missions. After downloading the game, you get access to two different maps. If you want to access any others, you have to buy the DLCs or join someone through multiplayer, if the host leaves, you will be kicked after 15 minutes. Different maps have different animals to hunt which adds much needed variety to the game. This game is meant for solitary gameplay, even if it has access to a multiplayer. At the end of the day, i would only recommend this game if you are patient and looking for a chill, relaxed solo experience.\",\n",
       "  \"A truly sad experience. This release crushes all fond childhood memories of playing Civ and totally misses the mark on what it should feel like to play the series.I really tried to like Civ VII, but I can't.

The biggest money grab I have ever experienced, and bald-faced too: release a game that's clearly not in a good state, charge an insane price for it (people will buy it anyways, right) AND release the first DLC less than a month later. In retrospect, maybe we should have seen it coming.Instead of echoing all the other reviews that go into detail of what's wrong and what would be a path forward to start fixing some of the broken trust, I'll just say this: don't buy this game in its current state, and wait for a sale if you really want to play Civ VII.

The game itself is two steps ahead other games in terms of realistic vehicle simulation and its soft-body physics, so thanks to this it's unique. Driving cars is easy, just press W, but controlling them is a whole different story. Disabling automatic clutch, gearbox safety and playing on a manual gearbox using a steering wheel makes the game a lot harder to play, but that's the fun here. Tuning cars, especially with mods, is really fun and rewarding once you master it. I've never seen a game with this much car tuning capabilites, so that makes it stand out among others. Mods make the gameplay 10x better, as there are infinite possibilities to play the game. For now, there are only short scenarios and freeroam, that can get boring after some time, but a career mode is in the making since the game is in early access. The game in its current state is really fun as-is, and it will continue to expand in the future. The devs are updating and hotfixing the game frequently, so that is a big plus. Also, I hope BeamNG will get optimised more and more, because rendering and calculating physics is really CPU intensive, so playing with more than 1-2 cars will drop your framerate, especially on big maps, like West Coast USA. Overall, if you like cars you need to play this game, it's really fun once you get into it.\",\n",

       "  '2024 Update:The Final Shape is really good. Still wouldn\\'t recommend any new players to try this game though.Old Review:Ah, Destiny. I love so much about this franchise. The gameplay, shooting, jumping, throwing lots of grenades, dismantling guns.. Destiny is a franchise I\\'ve spent a lot of time in. I\\'ve accomplished some of the hardest achievements in the game. Low man raid encounters, solo flawless dungeon completions, Conquerer seals, etc. My honest opinion on this game is that it\\'s the best PvE FPS experience out there, ruined in multiple ways by problems that honestly shouldn\\'t be hard to fix or at least shouldn\\'t have been a problem for this long. I\\'ll start with the good:- Top tier gunplay and class feel- The in game movement is an underrated part of the experience in my opinion, each class has it\\'s own traversal tech if you really want to git gud- The raids and dungeons oh my god, they\\'re so awesome. Almost worth the time to invest into alone- Some of the coolest moments in the history of online gaming have happened in Destiny (just look up the Whisper mission)- The seasonal stories over the past year and current campaign as of writing this (Witch Queen) have great storytelling- Guns. So many guns. Almost a gun for every situation. Most of us in the community have actual real nostalgia for the muscle memory of some of our guns that we can\\'t use anymore. - Tons of content to check out for a new player- Regular weekly updates from the dev team on Thursdays (TWAB = This Week At Bungie)- On top of that, the dev team is pretty active on Twitter when the more unhinged members of the player base aren\\'t sending them death threats- The soundtrack is incredible- This is gonna sound like a meme but for real, the enemy AI in this game is pretty incredible. It can bug out sometimes of course but especially in harder content, different enemy types approach you different ways based on the weapons you use or the places you stand.- If you like the Diablo experience of just mowing down packs of enemies, D2 can fill that spot in your heartNow for the cons:- We\\'re all addicted. You\\'ll see this whole \"lol 5k hours I don\\'t recommend but I\\'ll log back in tomorrow\" jokes and honestly, there\\'s some truth to that. It\\'s a grindy MMO game. Some elements of it are designed to keep you playing.- All the classics are here: weekly drip-feeding of new content, bad communication on certain long-standing issues in the game for months and even years at a time, and a general level of jank and bugginess to the game that doesn\\'t really ever go away.- Certain parts of the game are massively undeveloped, but forced into the same grinds every season. Crucible, the main PVP mode in this game, only just got it\\'s first new map this season (4 weeks ago at the time of writing) in over 3 years.- Gambit, another main playlist, has been reworked like 4 times(?) since it came out and has somehow gotten worse each time. Also hasn\\'t had a new map since it came out, and has in fact actually lost content since it\\'s release.- The whole game runs on peer to peer servers. This isn\\'t super noticeable for the majority of content in the game, as most of the content in Destiny 2 is team based PvE content or story missions etc, but this makes the PvP just generally unplayable to a lot of people who try it. Crucible can be very fun but there\\'s always a layer of \"oh wow I just headshot that guy with my reticle at least half of my screen away from him\"- The cosmetic shop in Destiny 2, the eververse, is not one of the worst systems I\\'ve ever seen but it\\'s not super great either. It\\'s a pretty classic case of all of the best looking armor sets in the game, and virtually ALL weapon ornaments (weapon cosmetics in regular terms) being locked behind either a real money purchase or PRAYING it goes on sale for a currency you can earn weekly in game. Some cosmetics in the eververse haven\\'t been available for bright dust in years.- Sunsetting, a big process that happened about 2 years ago, removed a ton of content from the game that most of us paid real money for. Entire expansion areas, weapons, quests, etc. were \"vaulted\"- Bungie has a history of taking a really long time to fix more wide, sweeping issues with the game- Bungie\\'s current season system has a few good elements to it, but overall the way they\\'ve designed seasons has become pretty stale over the past 2 years or so- Bugs, man. Destiny 2 is always a buggy game, more than most in my experience. Most of us learn to live with the general jank, but it can be really frustrating sometimes. This season (Season of the Haunted) has been even worse than usual.- The main 3 playlists, Vanguard Ops (short PvE missions such as strikes and battlegrounds), Crucible, and Gambit, are roughly 40% or maybe more of your playtime each season, yet they haven\\'t updated them in any meaningful way in at least 3 years. - The pricing of this game. Realistically, D2 should\\'ve never been pushed as a free to play game. If you wanna access, and I\\'m not exaggerating, 95% of this game, you have to buy the expansions anyway. There\\'s no \"previous expansions\" bundle at a reduced price, and nowadays there\\'s even stuff like the 30th anniversary pack that gives you a dungeon and a rocket launcher for 30 bucks. It\\'s hard to get new players into this game when you have to open with \"well I know it says free to play but if you wanna realistically do the endgame content in this game (Trials/GM Nightfalls) you\\'ll have to spend like 200 dollars for all the expansions\"- The UI is kinda slow and bad. There\\'s a decent amount of item bloat so if you\\'re like me and hate having like 10 new flashing items in your inventory, you\\'re gonna spend a lot of time holding your F key to dismantle thingsDestiny 2 is a game that is super great at it\\'s core, but tends to shoot itself in the foot a lot of the time. It\\'s a conflicted game, with most of the dev time in seasonal content seemingly going towards releasing new things and rarely improving the content we spend the majority of our time grinding. It\\'s also a game that\\'s going through a big transition period right now. Currently Bungie has made it pretty clear that they\\'re developing D2 for the long term right now, so some things are just being pushed to the side for the overall health of the future of the game. I don\\'t know how much I believe that, but if you\\'re reading this and you know what I mean when I say Path of Exile 2, I salute you. One thing I haven\\'t really mentioned so far is that realistically, the best content in this game really requires a group of friends to enjoy at it\\'s fullest. I\\'ve been lucky enough to make some real long-term friends in my clan, and legitimately spend a lot of my time teaching new players how to do raids/dungeons/GMs. If you\\'re a solo player, many activities are either straight up impossble (raids) or they require significant time investment to complete solo (dungeons, GM nightfalls, etc). It\\'s a game all about building your vault of items so you have something for every situation. New weapon roll for this build, crazy armor roll with great stats, etc. This can take a long time and kind of creates this weird situation for newer players where they can just go months without getting a certain exotic weapon they need. To cut things short, I love this game and have obviously spent a lot of time with it. I can\\'t currently recommend it to newer players unfortunately. If you\\'re returning, maybe. The Witch Queen campaign on Legendary difficulty is some of the most fun I\\'ve had with my friends in this game in years, and the seasonal stories really do get better and better. If you have friends and the disposable income, give the game a shot. If you want the game to respect your time, look elsewhere.',\n",
